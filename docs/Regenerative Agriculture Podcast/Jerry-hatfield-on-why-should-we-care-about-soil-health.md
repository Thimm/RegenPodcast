**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:00:33):**  It's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published

**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.

**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:10):**  of regenerative agriculture ecosystems and talk about how to regenerate soil and crop health and  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:15):**  quality. And also very importantly, how to increase farm profitability. In this episode,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:22):**  I'm very excited to welcome Jerry Hatfield to our show. Jerry and I had a bit of a technology  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:30):**  mishap. I actually interviewed Jerry a little while ago and we mysteriously lost the first  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:37):**  several minutes of the audio recording vanished into the ether somewhere. So I'm circling back  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:42):**  around with Jerry to recapture some of the pieces that we spoke about in the very beginning.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:48):**  And you may notice a short blip as the audio switches from one to another a few minutes into  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:02:55):**  the clip, but wanted to recapture some of those pieces. So Jerry, thank you very much for joining  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:00):**  us. We're very excited to have you here in the podcast. Well, I'm glad to be here, John. Jerry,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:06):**  you've done a lot of intriguing work with soils, looking at how soils and plants interact and how  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:13):**  they are impacted by climate. What have been some of the highlights that have led you to the things  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:20):**  that you're working on today and some of the things that you're looking at? You know, you look  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:24):**  at, it's always interesting to look back at one's career and think about the paths that we take in  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:30):**  terms of investigations and looking at the piece of this. But I think the largest thing that drives  
**[0:03:38-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:38):**  me is how can we improve the efficiency of plants to capture water, capture nutrients, capture light,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:47):**  and put that into productivity. And we don't often think about, we've got this basic process of  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:03:54):**  photosynthesis, you know, that creates all the carbohydrates that really drives the whole plant  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:00):**  growth process. But that system in itself is really interacts with what happens within the soil.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:09):**  It happens with what happens within the plant. You got this very complex set of interactions going on.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:16):**  But what drives a lot of our questions right now is, what role does this whole soil-plant  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:25):**  atmosphere continuum have in terms of improving not only the productivity of the plant, but also  
**[0:04:31-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:31):**  the quality of the products that that plant is harvested for. And if we're thinking about the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:40):**  grain with protein or a vegetable with a certain amount of material that we want in their sugar  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:47):**  content and fruit, you know, all those different things. And so become very fascinated with just  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:04:52):**  how some of these things that we do influences what the quality of that produce that we're  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:00):**  trying to derive from that plant. Today, there's a lot of discussion about how if we want to grow  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:06):**  healthy plants, we need to have a healthy soil. And there are lots of conversations around  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:14):**  soil health and how to improve soil health and you can do this and you can do that.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:19):**  But it seems to me that perhaps we've missed one of the several important pieces in thinking  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:26):**  about soil health. And the question I would have for you is, why should we care about soil health?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:31):**  Yeah, that's not to say that's always an interesting question, because I think that  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:36):**  sometimes we're so enamored with soil health and saying, well, what's the perfect measurement of  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:41):**  soil health, that we lose sight of the fact of why do we want healthy soils to start with? I mean,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:49):**  if you just think about the whole process, I think they're in the whole soil health arena,  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:05:56):**  they're really looking at a couple fundamental pieces of this. And one of the first pieces of  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:03):**  soil health is what I would call the aggregation structure. What is really that surface of that  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:08):**  soil look like? Because the surface of the soil is the interface between the soil and the atmosphere.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:16):**  And we know that those stable aggregates that are near the surface is what allows the rainfall  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:23):**  or irrigation water to penetrate into that soil. And we say, well, we've improved the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:28):**  infiltration rate, we get water into it. But we forget that same aggregation structure  
**[0:06:35-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:35):**  is critical for the exchange of CO2 and oxygen between the atmosphere and the soil as well.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:43):**  And that may be even more critical than the water infiltration rates. And why that becomes important  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:50):**  is because below our soil surface is a really complex set of biological components, whether  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:06:57):**  they be roots, all the microbial system that's there, the fauna that's living there, earthworms,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:04):**  bugs, everything else is living there, all of those need oxygen as well. And so when we  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:10):**  trap that off, you know, we basically have, we limit our biological activity. But if you just  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:16):**  take and extend that simple process and say, all right, we're getting water into the soil,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:20):**  we're getting air into the soil, CO2 and oxygen into that soil, and that's driving the biological  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:26):**  process. But it's that biological process that's going on that really determines the what those  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:34):**  plants are doing in terms of being able to take up nutrients, how nutrients get cycled, the  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:40):**  differences between a diseased soil and a non-diseased soil, all of those things that we look at.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:48):**  And so you can think about the healthy soil as a healthy ecosystem below the soil surface,  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:07:54):**  and you begin to drive this process forward. And the reason for caring really comes down to  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:00):**  very simple things is that we make that whole plant system much more efficient in terms of the  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:06):**  use of water, or the use of light or the use of nutrients so that we're actually getting more  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:12):**  plant biomass or more plant product, whether it's grain or fruits or vegetables or anything else,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:19):**  per unit of the natural resources that we're putting in. And the soil health becomes the  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:25):**  kind of the unifying factor that allows that efficiency to take place. It also allows that  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:31):**  quality of that produce to be positively affected.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:36):**  So in essence, what I'm hearing you describe is that soil health is a very big term that  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:43):**  encompasses multiple aspects, but the big pieces are that, or perhaps the most fundamental piece  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:49):**  is that it provides the environment in which biology can function to increase, which provides  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:08:56):**  the environment for plants to really be a lot more efficient. You're describing, if I'm  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:02):**  understanding it correctly, you're describing soil health is needed and is necessary to allow  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:09):**  biology to function so that plants can function. So you're really describing biology as being  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:14):**  kind of this bridge, this mediator between what is happening in soil and what is happening in plants.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:19):**  Yep, that's really the essence of it. And I don't know that we've ever, we don't put it in that  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:24):**  context very often. We talk about soil health, we talk about the fact that we've improved  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:31):**  infiltration or we've improved gas exchange or we've, we actually it's even more fundamental than  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:37):**  that. We talk about improving CEC or improving infiltration rates or aggregate structure,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:43):**  reducing bulk density. To me, those are metrics, but in reality, we need to put it together and  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:50):**  say, so what? And the so what is that we want that soil really to enhance our plant function  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:09:58):**  at the end of the day for multiple reasons.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:00):**  In terms of how things get cycled, how they get released, how they begin to apply back to that  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:08):**  crop. So now you think about the other piece of this is that we've released all this, we've made  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:14):**  it available, there's plenty of oxygen for that root to grow quite efficiently. There's plenty of  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:21):**  water for that plant not to have any suffering in there. And so we end up balancing that whole  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:28):**  system so that plant can perform optimally. And when it begins to perform optimally is when we  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:35):**  see a lot greater increase in quality. It really, it makes a little difference if we're talking  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:42):**  about a grain crop, a fruit crop or a leafy vegetable crop, we see in those crops and when we  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:48):**  put them in those situations, much higher quality produce of however we think about  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:54):**  produce out there. If it's lettuce, it's kale, or if it's tomatoes or strawberries, or if it's  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:10:59):**  corn or wheat, we see an improved quality of all that just because of the simple changes that we  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:06):**  made that basically started with soil health. So that's a really, Jerry, when you talk about  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:14):**  quality for all these different plants, some crop quality, we're talking about improved test weight,  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:18):**  others we're talking about improved protein content, we're talking about improved protein  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:24):**  content, there's many different components of quality. How does one overarching characteristic  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:29):**  such as improved soil quality improve all these various characteristics with different plants?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:36):**  Yeah, that becomes a dynamic that if we think about improvement, and let's just take  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:44):**  grain for example in terms of test weight protein content as one example in all of this, is we begin  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:52):**  to create a more balanced system within our soil so that we've got this balanced nutrients and  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:11:59):**  we're balancing that against all the different things of root function in terms of the water  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:05):**  uptake and gas exchange and exudates and all of that, is that we basically are taking that plant  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:11):**  and saying that metabolically within that plant we've created a condition in which that plant  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:19):**  has the capacity to store more carbohydrates more efficiently and all the carbohydrate byproducts  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:26):**  efficiently within that grain. And we end up with higher test weights, we end up with  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:32):**  higher protein content, we can end up with higher oil content of what that's what we're looking at,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:37):**  and it really is a complex set of interactions but it all begins with saying how do we improve  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:44):**  the capacity of that plant and that soil to interact together in terms of extracting these  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:50):**  nutrients, extracting water, and just allowing that plant to optimize itself. We've been having  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:12:55):**  this conversation about soil health and crop health but I think perhaps we haven't discussed  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:00):**  one very fundamental piece is how do we regenerate soil health? How do we improve soil health to a  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:07):**  much higher plateau of performance? Yeah, you're right, it's very good to talk about the impact  
**[0:13:15-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:15):**  of what this means but the question that producers ask is how do we get there? And I  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:23):**  constructed a while ago what I call the soil aggregation ladder. How do you build soils back up?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:30):**  And the first rung on that ladder is biological activity. We have to restore biological activity  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:38):**  within that soil and soil biology wants four things. It wants food, water, air, and shelter.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:45):**  And what do you want? You want food, water, air, and shelter. The basic four needs that we have  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:52):**  as humans is what the biology wants within that soil. You think about the shelter piece and just  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:13:58):**  very quickly to explain that, the shelter piece is soil biology doesn't want any more extremes in the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:05):**  environment than you and I do. They don't want to be exposed to real hot conditions or real dry  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:09):**  conditions or real cold conditions. So one of the things in terms of shelter is basically to put  
**[0:14:15-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:15):**  some sort of cover over that soil. Living cover, residue cover, compost cover at the surface  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:24):**  because it modifies that temperature moisture regime that that soil is going through.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:29):**  Just to give you an example, conventional corn soybean systems early June typical year,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:37):**  that soil surface temperature will be 120 degrees Fahrenheit. It'll be plus 100 with  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:44):**  one or two inches within that soil surface and extremely dry. Well that's beyond the range in  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:50):**  which plants biological activity really functions well. But if we just add a little bit of shading,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:14:57):**  a little bit of residue cover to that, we take that soil surface temperature down to 86 degrees,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:04):**  85 degrees, we keep it moist all the time. Well that's the optimum environment for that  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:10):**  biology to begin to express itself. So we don't cook that biology out of the soil.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:15):**  You know, at the same time adding that root material and everything else as a food source  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:22):**  for the biology to be working on. A lot of our modern agricultural systems is that we're not  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:28):**  supplying food throughout the whole year. I mean you just go back to corn and soybeans. Basically  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:34):**  they're growing three, three and a half months out of the year. You know, what if I only fed you  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:40):**  three and a half months out of the 12 months? You know, and that's kind of how we do our biology is  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:45):**  that we don't think about what it takes to feed that biological systems throughout the whole  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:51):**  12 month cycle that's out there. And the other piece then is again going back to why do we do  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:15:58):**  soil health in terms of the oxygen exchange is that a lot of these are aerobic systems. You know,  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:05):**  they want oxygen as much as you and I. If you cut that oxygen supply off, you cut the biology off  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:11):**  as well. So you've got food, water, air and shelter. And so all of these things fit together  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:17):**  and that's the first rung on this ladder in which we begin to build soils up. Well once we begin to  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:24):**  stabilize that, we see a lot of organic matter cycling. They begin to break down root material.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:30):**  You know, the more diverse we can keep the root system in terms of all this, the more diverse we  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:36):**  see our biology. One of the things that fascinates me is that in our soils where we've got diverse  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:43):**  rotation, we see a lot different biological activity. We see a lot different CO2 and oxygen  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:51):**  dynamics going on in that profile which is indicative of the biological activity than if we  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:16:56):**  have a monoculture. And so it's very interesting in all of this and I think we're just on the cusp  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:01):**  of really beginning to realize how the diversity of plants that we put on in a soil increases the  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:08):**  diversity of the biological system. The unfortunate part is that if we talk about the soil microbiome,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:16):**  all the different things that make up that biological system in the soil, is that we  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:21):**  probably only understand 5% of that microbiome. 95%, you know, we don't really understand yet.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:27):**  So we're in a frontier in my opinion of being able to do this. So you know we've got organic  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:33):**  matter cycling. Once you get the organic matter cycling, we see a lot of nutrient cycling going  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:38):**  on and those are what I characterize as the dynamic and invisible processes that are going  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:45):**  on in soil. We don't see them but we do see the outcome of one of the outcomes that we see out of  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:51):**  that that we've talked about earlier is that we see that stable aggregates because we know that  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:17:58):**  those aggregates come from a biological system that's giving off exudates forming that glue that  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:05):**  makes that aggregate, the sand, silt and clay and organic matter really form together in a much  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:10):**  better way than what we have. And then we also see the other outcome in terms of improved infiltration  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:17):**  rates and gas exchange rates. So it's just kind of that ladder that we build up as we think about  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:22):**  all these things coming together. One of the pieces that I've just been amazed by is how quickly  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:29):**  the entire ecosystem can improve and how quickly soil health can get to a much better place.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:37):**  So how fast do you believe we can regenerate soil health and improve soil health to a much  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:42):**  higher plateau of performance? That's a fascinating question because we often assume that  
**[0:18:50-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:18:50):**  soil is a very sluggish system that it takes years and decades to see these changes in here.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:01):**  But we're seeing that within one growing season we can begin to see changes in the aggregates  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:08):**  near the surface, we change changes in the biological activity, we see all of these things  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:14):**  going on. I think there are a lot of dynamics that are occurring very very quickly in our soils.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:20):**  Any step back and you think about why would that be? Well it really is a function that  
**[0:19:27-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:27):**  biology actually works quite quickly. The impacts of that occur quite quickly. It may take centuries  
**[0:19:37-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:37):**  to degrade a rock to soil but it may take only months to see changes in how that biological  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:45):**  system is working. We've been able in some of our experiments where we control the environment,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:52):**  we put different combinations of crops on there. We've seen that we can change the aggregates near  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:19:58):**  that surface within one growing season and those aggregates haven't fully reached the  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:06):**  stable aggregate size yet but the fact that they've already begun to change is indicative of  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:13):**  that we can take these soils through transitions, we can do it rather quickly and we have a  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:18):**  tremendous impact on this. We just have to understand that we as humans tend to think  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:23):**  that we manipulate this system and can do anything we want with it. We need to change our philosophy  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:28):**  and say how do we allow the biology to assist us in reaching the end goal that we want out there  
**[0:20:34-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:34):**  in terms of soils. Exactly. A moment ago you mentioned how you had observed having a diverse  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:42):**  number of different plants produce very different soil microbial changes or soil aggregate changes  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:48):**  than just having a single species. Can you describe a little bit for us what you've been observing?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:52):**  Yeah, we have a very interesting experiment underway and these are columns of soil.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:20:59):**  These are 18 inches in diameter, they're 24 inches deep, they're instrumented with soil water  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:06):**  sensors and temperature sensors and electrical conductivity and CO2 sensors and oxygen sensors  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:12):**  and we've taken these 18 inch cores and we've divided them into basically pie shapes so there's  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:21):**  a third of the core and it's divided all the way down to the bottom so they're separate pieces  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:25):**  except for drainage at the bottom. We put in a no cover crop, we put in an oat cover crop and we put  
**[0:21:32-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:32):**  in a cover crop cocktail which was an oat, a pea and a radish. Where we did the oat, pea and a  
**[0:21:43-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:43):**  radish even compared to the monoculture oat we saw an entirely different CO2 and oxygen regime within  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:52):**  that the soil columns. We saw a different change in the aggregate structure because we come in and  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:21:59):**  we just collect samples right near the surface when we finish these runs. All these different  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:04):**  things are going on but you also, this isn't just our observations out there. If you look at  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:12):**  individuals that have been running cover crop cocktails in you know fields and things like that,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:18):**  the changes that they see in their soils and when they talk about the changes in organic matter and  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:24):**  changes in soil, much more rapid when they've got the cocktail than when they've got the monoculture  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:30):**  out there and that was what kind of fascinated this on this whole process of really what's  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:35):**  happening in there. Well if you think about this just merely from a standpoint that exudates are  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:42):**  going to be given off by an oat as opposed to the exudates from a legume or an exudates from a radish  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:48):**  are going to create a diverse set of exudates which in reality probably create a diverse set  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:22:55):**  of microbial aspects because not everybody likes to eat the same thing and so I think we just end  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:02):**  up amplifying the diversity of the biological system within that soil merely by how we've  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:09):**  changed that mixture of crops that are out there and we see that a little bit of the same thing if  
**[0:23:14-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:14):**  we think about adding a diverse rotation, if we add small grains into a corn soybean system,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:23):**  we see a much different response in terms of that crop than if we just have the corn soybean in part  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:29):**  of this and so you know you see a lot of this evidence that's out there the real question that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:34):**  we're trying to ask is why are we what's really in the in the soil that's causing this reaction or  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:40):**  what's in that system that's causing that change within the soil. And what is your answer to that  
**[0:23:44-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:44):**  question? Well the answer to that question is that we're trying to understand all of this. We know  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:52):**  that the microbial microbiological activity because we actually collect that of our columns as well  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:23:58):**  is much higher in that diversity, that diverse system. So the answer is that we're trying to  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:04):**  understand this, that we don't fully recognize how all these pieces fit together because it's  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:11):**  a question that we really have not asked very in a very detailed fashion in terms of saying you know  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:18):**  how do these things really interact within this. So this is probably one of the great front in my  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:24):**  opinion one of the great frontiers in science right now. Yeah I see when with the various farms  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:30):**  that we work with the bringing cover crop diversity and bringing a strong crop rotation  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:36):**  back to the farm can regenerate soil health and it is it is amazing how as that soil begins changing  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:44):**  crops begin changing as well and the best way that I know how to describe it is that  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:50):**  crops begin behaving differently. We thought we knew exactly how a certain crop would grow  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:24:55):**  and respond and how it would respond to certain climactic conditions and all of a sudden it's as  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:02):**  though the crop begins behaving differently it begins responding differently and it gets to be  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:07):**  a lot of fun to see how crops change out in the field. I can't disagree with that I mean if you  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:12):**  really look at all of these things that are happening John is that I think we need to rediscover  
**[0:25:20-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:20):**  what the value of rotations are in this system and if you look at where we've sort of progressed over  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:31):**  the last 20 or 30 years and maybe even longer back than that is that we we assumed that we knew  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:40):**  what crops were going to do how crops are going to respond and but if now that we're going into  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:46):**  much more diverse rotations I think we have to rediscover some of the information that was  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:52):**  probably available to us you know 50 60 years ago when we had more diverse rotations and we saw  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:25:59):**  different responses and I think that this is going to be if we if we go back to this whole thing  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:05):**  of regenerative agriculture when we look at regenerative agriculture what does that really  
**[0:26:10-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:10):**  mean are we regenerating the soil or are we regenerating our ability to understand how  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:19):**  things behave much more in an ecological system you know and that we really need to look at all  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:25):**  the parts that are available to us and by looking at all the parts I mean what's going on within the  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:32):**  soil what's going on within the the cycling that's going on within the soil and and what is it  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:38):**  looking at in terms of plant response we know that as we begin to bring these things together  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:44):**  the plant becomes more efficient it becomes more efficient in its use of water it becomes more  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:49):**  efficient in its use of nutrients that gets out of the soil it becomes more efficient in its use  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:26:54):**  of solar radiation and it captures do we tend to to get a higher quality product out of that we  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:00):**  were tending to get more growth and the other piece of this which intrigues a lot of producers  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:05):**  and why they're interested in this is when we begin to do these things we're increasing their  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:11):**  stability of yields over time so that they don't see the wild swings as the weather changes from  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:16):**  year to year as those yields become more stable and you know you mentioned at the very beginning  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:22):**  that it was really about increasing profitability well you can increase profitability at two ways  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:29):**  one is to improve the parts of your field that that are costing you money the other one is to  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:34):**  improve your stability among the years so that you're not having these wild swings and yield  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:41):**  reductions when the weather's bad both of those are very important pieces and yeah just going back  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:47):**  to you made a couple of comments that we have observed in the field and they're they're really  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:52):**  exciting when they start happening one of one of your comments was that not what are we really  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:27:58):**  regenerating are we regenerating soils are we regenerating the thought processes and the models  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:04):**  that we use and i really think that a major major part of the changes that happens is beginning to  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:11):**  think differently about what is happening and looking at different components and managing them  
**[0:28:15-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:15):**  differently out in the field yes and it's we're i think it is the regenerative agriculture is that  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:24):**  we're going to have to rediscover how agriculture fits into an ecological concept i think that  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:32):**  and when we talk about these processes it is not just about agronomic management it's really  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:39):**  placing that our agronomic management in the context of the whole ecosystem that we're working  
**[0:28:45-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:45):**  in and i think that becomes the critical knowledge piece that we need to start wrestling with to be  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:53):**  able to take us to the next level of how we begin to maybe rediscover these processes but begin to  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:28:59):**  place these processes into the next generation of saying how do we take agriculture to the next  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:04):**  level and one of the pieces that i believe taking agriculture to the next level that i'm personally  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:09):**  really excited about is this idea of increasing water use efficiency and nutrient use efficiency  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:17):**  this is without question something i'm certain we have observed on some of the farms that we've  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:22):**  worked with where all of a sudden we're growing we're able to grow a 220-booker acre corn crop  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:28):**  and yet we're not applying the same amount of water that we thought we needed to apply to grow  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:32):**  that crop and i believe this is something that's going to become increasingly important extremely  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:38):**  important in the future as we have more limited water resources and then the same also holds true  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:44):**  of course for nutrient use efficiency where all of a sudden we're seeing that we are able to get  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:50):**  the yields that we are the targets that we're setting with less nitrogen applications and  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:29:56):**  and better nutrient use efficiency what are the pieces that you have observed happening in the  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:00):**  field only in regards to those two pieces we've observed the same thing if you think about water  
**[0:30:07-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:07):**  use efficiency because just looking at a at a field you look at the high yielding parts of the  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:16):**  field and low yielding parts of the field basically the same rainfall falls on that whole field you  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:22):**  know that if we just take water use efficiency and say that's productivity relative to the amount of  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:28):**  water that that plant has available to it is that in some cases we have a soil limitation that you  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:33):**  know we don't hold as much water so it's already water limited from that standpoint the other piece  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:39):**  of this because water and nutrients are actually intrinsically tied together when we talk about  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:45):**  why do we see limitations in water use efficiency at times it's because the plant is nutrient  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:50):**  limited so that it doesn't have those nutrients to grow and therefore we may be expending a lot  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:30:57):**  of water by that plant but not getting much of a return in terms of of fruit or grain or even  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:04):**  leafy production out of that and so when we optimize both water and nutrients together  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:10):**  and then we begin to see this real increase in in productivity and again back to the stability  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:17):**  of that productivity and you know and and so we've added that additional component  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:22):**  and that is how efficient is that plan in capturing solar radiation because if you think  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:28):**  about what that plan is doing is is taking solar radiation is converting it into photosynthate  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:35):**  that's where all the growth products come from both in the shoots as well as the roots  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:40):**  and they're mediated by water and and nutrients so the more efficient we can make that plant  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:46):**  in capturing light and converting it into this and then looking at all right where does that fit in  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:52):**  terms of water use efficiency you know and and a lot of that is due to how plants respond early in  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:31:59):**  the season and I'll go back to this thing of why aggregates and gas are so important is because  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:06):**  a lot of times we see limitations of plant growth early in the season because that plant is oxygen  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:14):**  limited we end up with a lot of rainfall in the spring we flood that soil we don't have the  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:19):**  aggregate structure we end up with a lot of yellow plants out there everybody assumes that's nutrients  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:25):**  but it's really gas oxygen limitation and once we begin to limit the vigor of that plant early  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:31):**  in the season it carries throughout the whole season and so we've already said what's that and  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:36):**  you can never quite catch up again you never catch up you know and I think this what happens  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:42):**  in the early part of the season really does set the tone for the rest of the season it also sets  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:47):**  the tone for how efficiently that plant takes up nutrients and so all of these things you know  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:52):**  call us crazy but I think we we have to look at how water and nutrients light and light all  
**[0:32:59-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:32:59):**  and light all interact together in terms of this these processes to understand how do we really  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:07):**  again take agriculture to the next level in terms of productivity but also quality.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:12):**  Jerry within the context of all these various pieces we've been talking about perhaps in a  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:17):**  broader context if you wish what is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:23):**  that many other people don't believe to be true? I think one of the truths in modern agriculture  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:28):**  that we need to discover is is how important improving our soils really are to  
**[0:33:37-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:37):**  increasing productivity. I think we we live under this false assumption that genetics will always  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:47):**  lead to improved productivity but if you look at this I mean you you look at at wheat production  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:33:55):**  you look at some rice production some of these we're seeing slight increases in productivity  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:01):**  but we're seeing that we're beginning to level off so we're not getting the full capture of what  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:07):**  that potential crop is out there and so then that comes back and saying all right how do I manage  
**[0:34:13-0:34:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:13):**  that crop differently and so I think that when I begin to discover is that we need to to look at  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:20):**  how does this system and we and we put together this concept that we call genetics by environment  
**[0:34:26-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:26):**  by management and it really was set up in such a way to break away from the old classic genetics  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:34):**  by environment interactions to genetics by environment by management to get producers to  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:39):**  realize that they had a very specific role in their crop management that was beyond just hybrid  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:47):**  selection and it was really saying all right how does the management of their their soils how is  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:53):**  their management of their nutrients how does the management of everything fit in to allow those  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:34:58):**  genetics to be optimized and when you start having that dialogue with producers and begin to realize  
**[0:35:04-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:04):**  that there are a lot of options but maybe a path of discovery about why is what's causing their  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:12):**  yield limitation why aren't they getting the yields that they think they should be getting  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:17):**  what's causing that yield variation among the years that are out there and so it's just asked  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:22):**  what it's doing is leading to a point in which is causing them to ask different questions about the  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:28):**  overall system that's out there. Jerry what is the what is the possibility what is the opportunity  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:33):**  in terms of improved yield and quality when when you when we have this conversation about improving  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:39):**  soil health and the impact on test weight and yield we talk about gas exchange carbon dioxide  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:45):**  improving substantially improving photosynthesis what do you believe that can mean for growers in  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:51):**  terms of profitability what really is the opportunity? I think it's quite large in terms  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:35:56):**  of profitability and the reason I say it's in terms of profitability is is think about the an  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:03):**  average field that that's out here and this would be an average grain field I mean we see a lot of  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:09):**  variation in yield across that field because the different soils that are out there if we improve  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:15):**  those soils in the lower or in the bad parts of field field that's showing more yield variation  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:20):**  among the years is if you can get those soils improved automatically we improve the overall  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:26):**  profitability of that field because producers are basically putting on the same amount of inputs  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:32):**  they're putting on the same nitrogen they're putting on the same phosphorus  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:35):**  you know maybe even liming the same across that overall field but still getting different yield  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:41):**  responses and so if if you could just improve the the return on your investment for what you  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:48):**  put on there by improving the soils you'd automatically improve the profitability of that  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:53):**  field and so you know I think that becomes a piece of this puzzle that we begin to look at  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:36:59):**  the other piece of this in terms of profitability and it goes back to the conversation we had on on  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:37:05):**  water and nutrient efficiency and particularly in the nutrient efficiency because when we get  
**[0:37:10-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:37:10):**  these soils improved is that we have to put less nutrients on and if you look at long-term no-till  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:37:18):**  producers is that you know a lot of them have reduced their nitrogen rates by half and still  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:37:24):**  have the same yields out there because that soil is supplying so many of those nutrients so if  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/jerry-hatfield-on-why-should-we-care-about-soil-health/#t=0:37:29):**  you can reduce your inputs you can begin to improve your profitability as well because

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:27:38)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is Jon and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast, where we talk about agronomic  
**[0:00:05-0:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  sciences and cultural management practices that can regenerate soil health, plant health,  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:10):**  and ultimately public health. My guest for this episode is a farmer that you may have  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:15):**  heard of, but if not, you're about to hear from him now, Adam Chappell from down south  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  in the United States. Adam, it's an honor to have you here. If you could kick us off,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  tell us a little bit about your farming operation and how your management has evolved over the  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:31):**  last couple of decades.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  Sure, glad to be with you this morning, Jon. I farm with my brother, Seth. We farm about  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  7,500 acres in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, and if you're wondering where that is, it's halfway  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  between Little Rock and Memphis, so in east central Arkansas. It's real easy to find on  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  a map. Just follow 40 halfway and then go up about 5 miles and you'll find us. We farm  
**[0:00:55-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:00:55):**  corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and some small grains in the winter, mostly wheat and oats,  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  and we've recently integrated cattle in the last few years whenever we can. That's kind  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:10):**  of a situation dependent process, so it's not every year, but it's every year that we  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  can. We started off farming with our dad in 2005 and he retired in 2014 after a series  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  of unfortunate events on the farm, and we've had it full tilt from there and kind of got  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  started on this regenerative path, not knowing anything about regenerative ag. I don't know  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  if your listeners are familiar with my story, but if not, I'll just go ahead and tell it  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:41):**  to them.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:42):**  Yeah, please tell us from the beginning. We have many listeners from all over the world.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  Yeah, so we started farming in 2005 with dad, so we got in on the tail end of Roundup's  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  effectiveness and quickly figured out that Roundup was losing the fight to pigweed. So  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  we started doing everything that we were supposed to, trying to reduce tillage. Of course, we  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  weren't completely no-tilled then and we're as close to completely no-tilled as we can  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:05):**  get now, but we started reducing tillage and just overlapping residuals and mixing up modes  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  of action and rotating, doing everything we were supposed to do, and we were losing that  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  fight to pigweed. That weed was single-handedly putting us in the bankruptcy category. We  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  were getting closer every year, just refinancing and having to do things to fill up shortfalls  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  because we were spending more than we were making trying to fight that weed, and we were  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  losing. So summer of 2009, things were getting real serious and we figured we either had  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  to figure out a way to beat this thing without spending more money or throwing more money  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  at it, or we might as well line up and sell because we weren't going to make it. So I  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:48):**  got on YouTube and started digging around. I'd been to all the meetings in Arkansas and  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  the Mid-South and all the answers were the same. More herbicide, more rotation, more  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  tillage. Well, none of that stuff was working, so I started investigating organic farmers.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  There weren't any organic farmers in our area at that time. There's a few now. Almost all  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  of them I found relied heavily at that time on tillage. I've got pictures, John. I'm telling  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:16):**  you, every time we tilled the farm two days later, it would be solid green with pigweeds.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:22):**  When the sun hits them right, you can see the pink cotyledons and then, man, you've  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  got a carpet. It's just a fight we couldn't win with tillage. I just happened to find  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  a guy named Pumpkinhead81 out of Pennsylvania. This guy was planting organic pumpkins into  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:37):**  big old tall grass called cereal rye. I had never seen anything like that in my life.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  The closest thing we'd ever gotten to that is double cropping soybeans into wheat straw,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:49):**  stripper wheat straw, which is really easy. What this guy was doing looked hard. When  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  I watched his videos, I noticed that he was planting pumpkins in June. I don't know what  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  kind of weed spectrum they got in Pennsylvania, but I know they got one. But he didn't have  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  any. He just had this big, tall, beautiful grass. He was rolling that down and then transplanting  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:14):**  his pumpkins. I noticed his equipment wasn't too fancy. That was right up my alley because  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  I couldn't afford to buy anything new. I figured, well, I can make the stuff I got work if this  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  guy can. That fall in 2009, we scraped up what money we could, which wasn't much, and  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  bought 300 acres worth of cereal rye seed and planted that. Then we planted some soybeans  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:37):**  and some cotton into it the following spring. That was our first experience planting anything  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  into a cover crop. We were scared of it and didn't let it get very big, probably 12 to  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  16 inches and panicked and killed it. But even at 12 to 16 inches, the harvest side  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:04:54):**  required on that 300 acres was maybe 50 or 60 percent of what it was everywhere else.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:02):**  That was huge. That put those acres in a profitable category. We thought we had a plan to beat  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  this thing and just started going as hard as we could from then on. Cover crops is what  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  has kept us in business and took us from the brink of bankruptcy to profitable enterprise  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  now.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  So, bring us forward to today. What does your operation look like today? Are you still killing  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  your cover crops with herbicides? Tell us a little bit about your crop rotation, your  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  use of cover crops in your operation right at this moment.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah, sure. So, back then we were corn cotton or corn beans, and we grew rice in our bottom  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:41):**  ground and we'd rotate beans in there once in a while. So, one thing that's really changed  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  is our rotation. At this point, we'll rotate all four crops on the same acre, which we  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  never done before. We let our cover crops get as big as we can now. We plant green in  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  most all scenarios unless we just get pushed out. We got to do something. We try to get  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  the stuff before it starts going super reproductive because we don't want to transfer all the  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:12):**  energy that's stored from the roots to the reproductive and seeds and things. We want  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  to save those for our crops. So, we will kill if we get to that point. But right now, it's  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  all still herbicide termination. We've got a big flat roller. Down here, we plant corn  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  and stuff early enough that crimping is not really an effective tool for us. Most of our  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  covers don't get to a stage where they can be effectively killed by crimping. So, we  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  still rely on herbicides. But the amount of herbicide it takes to kill a cover crop is  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:42):**  a fraction of what it was to hit all these weeds that we had made resistant to everything.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:47):**  So, I'm fine with that because it's not near the chemical load that it was and it's a lot  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  cheaper.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  What happens when we get more herbicide resistant rye?  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  Well, I don't know. I guess I'll crimp it. If I can't kill it, I'll let it go and I'll  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  crimp it.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  That doesn't seem particularly like you, but just the way you said that for some reason  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  that flashed into my mind.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  Right. I'm not too worried about that. We use a lot of different grass herbicides and  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  things and try to learn lessons from the past. I try to mix that up and keep that rye or  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:19):**  oats or whatever from seeing the same thing too often.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  So, you mentioned that you are planting in green. How long after your crop starts growing  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  are you spraying?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  Normally, we're spraying right after planting. So, our typical kill will be just take soybeans,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:37):**  for instance. We'll plant the soybeans. If we do have any kind of pigweed emergence or  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  anything like if we had a thin spot in our cover crop, then we'll come back with a light  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  rate of gramoxone and a pre-emerge. If we get a good stand of hard growing beans, there's  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:54):**  lots of times we can get by with just that for the year. Maybe another post application,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  but a lot of times if we get a good stand of beans and can shade the ground fast, then  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:04):**  that initial application is pretty good.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  You mentioned that you're not using tillage on no-till. What parts of your operation are  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  you still using tillage on?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  Really, the only time we have to do any tillage is when we have a really wet fall. Down here,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  in the last few years, it's happened quite a bit. The last two have been really good.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  We haven't had to till anything the last two falls, but 19 and 20 were both terrible. So,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  we had to fix a bunch of ruts. Even with our improved soil structure, we still had ruts  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  that weren't going to rebound. We had to fix.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  Then the only other time that we do any tillage is if we need to do some land forming. We  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  got to get it where the dirt pans can move stuff around. For irrigation and stuff, we're  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  all for our irrigation, so that's pretty important down here. We don't have a lot of sprinklers  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  or anything like that, so we've got to get it where we can water down the road.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:08:57):**  Those are really the only two times we do any major tillage, and that's not very often.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  The only real tillage equipment that we pull every year, I don't know that it would be  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  called tillage equipment. Really, it's just a furrow cleaner. We just pull a little four-inch  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  plow and clean out our irrigation furrow just so we can get water to the bottom of the fields.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  We've developed infiltration rates now that we actually need a little disturbance to get  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  water to the bottom of the field. If we don't clean that furrow out, we're only going to  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  get about halfway down the paddock there. We lose all our water, so we'll have really  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  good crop at the top and dry at the bottom because we can't get it to push out to the  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  bottom.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  Wow, now that's a testament to the river  
**[0:09:39-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  was one. You have to compact the soil so you can get it to the far end of the field.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  As you've been on this journey now for the last decade, what are some of the highlights  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:53):**  that stand out in your memory? What are some of the stories that really make the shift  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  for you?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:09:59):**  Just the fact that we're still farming is a big deal for me. I don't know how many of  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:03):**  your listeners have ever stared a lawyer in the face and tried to figure out what your  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:07):**  plan was if you didn't make it this year, but I've done that and that's not fun. Just  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  the fact that we're still here and that's not at the front of my mind anymore is a huge  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  deal.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  From that first planting into cover in 2010 to now, I said before cover crops are the  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  reason we're here. We had several what would have been career ending events, I guess you'd  
**[0:10:31-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  say in that timeframe. 2011 we had a historic flood and my brother and my dad, our dad most  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  lost their homes and our farm was flooded around the edges pretty good for a good long  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:44):**  while so that was a tough year. 2012 we had a historic drought and 2012 is when cover  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  crops just really showed out. We were still not financially able to get every acre of  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  the farm covered in the fall. We had about half the farm covered that year. Had a good  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  stand to cover crop. In the fields that we had cover crop in in 2012 made excellent crops  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  and then the ones that we didn't where we were still in the same bare ground situation,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  it was minimum till but it was still bare ground, we couldn't keep enough water on those  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  crops and they made 40% less so we can't farm a single acre without these things and we  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  were already getting there. That just really solidified it and from then on we did everything  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  we could to get cover in the ground and did in fall of 2012 had a good year in 2013, did  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  it again in 2013, had a good year in 2014 except for the fact that we had an elevator  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:44):**  fold up on us and hit us for a bunch of money that we'll never see again but our inputs  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:50):**  were so low that year we survived that also but that was the event that scared dad bad  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  enough. He's old enough he said I'm done with this, this is getting too risky for me at  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  my age so that's when he sold out me and Seth bought him out and we kept going. We're too  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  dumb to be scared so we just keep rolling.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  You mentioned profitability and reduced inputs and we haven't really dug into that at this  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  point so you've been on this pathway using cover crops and you mentioned the reduced  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:23):**  herbicide inputs but how has the adoption of cover crops, the adoption of no till contributed  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:29):**  to your improved profitability? You've described how you recovered your situation on your farm.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:33):**  What are all the factors that these tools contributed?  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  We started out just trying to fight pigweed and the other benefits that we saw just came  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  you know like they do. We weren't expecting them. One of the very first things we saw  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  besides the help of weed control was we didn't have to water as much. That cover crop insulating  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  the ground from the extreme heat and raising our infiltration rates and stuff we noticed  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  that we weren't having to irrigate nearly as often as we were on our other fields, even  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:03):**  fields that were just no till but they were exposed to the sun and the wind and we were  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:08):**  cutting irrigations in half. We'd go from five day intervals on corn to 10 or 12 day  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  intervals on corn. Now we're up to 14 hour intervals on corn. It's crazy how much savings  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  that is. I mean water here is shallow but we've got a lot of electric wells and a lot  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  of diesel wells and you know those things add up pretty fast when you're having to run  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:30):**  them all the time. Then we started noticing and this kind of happened since I started  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:37):**  trying to figure out what was happening on the farm. I started going to no till on the  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  plains, national no till, listening to podcasts like yours and just trying to figure out what  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  I was seeing. I've got a master's degree in entomology. I studied a lot of ecology so  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  it's kind of easy for me to grasp the concepts that the speakers were throwing out. It just  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  made sense to me but we were seeing those things on the farm. We started reducing P  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  and K a little bit at a time. We hadn't put out any P and K since 16. I've got a professor  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  I work with at Arkansas State. He's interested in nitrogen cycling and we've reduced our  
**[0:14:16-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  nitrogen requirements on corn and rice and cotton based on a lot of his work. We're probably  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  on 60% of where we were before, maybe 50%. Especially today with the price of fertilizer,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  those are huge numbers.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  That's a big deal.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:34):**  Yeah, it's a big deal right now. Then we started working with a group out of Australia and  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  we do sap sampling and things and they help interpret that. We try to make adjustments  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:46):**  through the season and in preparation for the next season based on sap sampling. That  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  seems to have made a huge difference. What we are using and not using, it's just ever  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  evolving. The stuff is changing every year.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:00):**  Now the sap analysis is so valuable because you can see what the soil is actually delivering  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  or not delivering. You don't have to guess.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  The contributions of cover crops have been for you improved weed control and reduced  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:12):**  herbicide costs, reduced water and reduced fertilizer. You started talking a little bit  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  about entomology and ecology. What shifts have you noticed in your insect populations  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  and the overall soil ecology?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  The insect deal has been really big. We grow cotton down here and it's just a magnet for  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:33):**  insect pests, or at least I thought it was. Just for an example, I gave a talk last year.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:41):**  It was about cotton, the way we're growing cotton. I compared our insect sprays to just  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  the state average. Ligus is a big deal for cotton around here. A lot of people spray  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  that bug six, seven times a year. We sprayed on average one and a half times for the farm.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  Once in some fields, once in twice in a few others, compared to five times for the state  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  average. Then heliotis, bollworms and things like that, we try to grow non-BT cotton if  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  we can. Even with non-BT cotton, our worm sprays were less than the guys that had BT  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  cotton. We sprayed one maybe closer to two times and I think the state average was three  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  on a stack of cotton. Ours was nothing. My consultant that I went to graduate school  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:30):**  with, he's a fellow entomologist. He would send me pictures and stuff of ant colonies  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  just hauling off bollworm eggs. Things like that that you're not going to see when you're  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  bombing with insecticide all the time. We're getting a lot of help from the beneficial  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  population out there that I guess a lot of our neighbors are not.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  I want to dig a bit deeper into some of your cultural management with cotton and some other  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  crops. Before we go there, I don't want to lose sight of the profitability conversation.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  In very broad numbers, how has your profitability shifted? You were in a very difficult place  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  a decade ago. Obviously today, you're making money. How has your profitability compared  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  with other growers in the region? It's hard to tell. A lot of guys have new  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:16):**  equipment. Everything's shiny and new. They look like they're doing really good, but when  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  all my stuff was shiny and new, I was doing really bad. I don't know. I can speak from  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  my experience. I know that when I was trying to figure out how to get out of that hole,  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:32):**  everybody kept telling me I need to make more yield. Here's how you do it. You put out blah,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  blah, blah. I do all those things, and my yield would still be the same as it was just  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  trend. Every once in a while, we'd hit a lick and have a really good year, but we didn't  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:51):**  change anything. We put out what they told us, and it would work one year. Then the next  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  year, we put out the same stuff that they told us, and it wouldn't work. It'd be the  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  same or maybe even less. I remember that 2009 year was a wet year. We did all the things,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  put out all the extra stuff they told us, and our yields were worse than normal because  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  of the weather. I figured out real quick, you can't control  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:13):**  that stuff. You're going to get what Mother Nature decides to give you. It's just that  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:19):**  simple. You don't need all that stuff to get what she's willing to give you, I guess, is  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  what I've learned. Our profitability has come from cutting inputs, not raising yields. Our  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:31):**  yields are still on par with all of our neighbors. We rent 95% of our ground. We don't own a  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  whole lot of ground. If we weren't competitive, we wouldn't have a farm. Landowners won't  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  return on their investment too, which is their land. If there's somebody that can give them  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:49):**  20% more consistently, then that's what they're going to do. I understand that. Cutting inputs  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  hasn't reduced my competitiveness as far as yield, but it has increased my margin by cutting  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  inputs.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  What you're describing is, yes, you have cut some inputs in the sense of pesticides and  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  herbicides, but then maybe we need to think about this more in terms of input efficiency  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  and that some inputs are just a whole lot more efficient than others. For example, rye  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  or oat seed is a whole lot more efficient at delivering P and K and some nitrogen than  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:23):**  buying fertilizer. We tend to not think of those things as being equivalent, but in reality,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  that's actually what's happening and going on.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:31):**  I've heard y'all talk about this on this podcast and lots of podcasts talk about this. Soil  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  sampling, and I've questioned my experts directly on this, but they keep telling me I'm going  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  to mine my soil. I hear that every year. Well, if you don't put out something, eventually  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  you're going to mine it all out. I pull soil samples every year just to, it was to ease  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:53):**  my mind, but now it's to combat that narrative. We'll pull samples in the spring and I'll  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  have 120 units of available K. Soybeans is the one that they say is the worst. I'll plant  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:06):**  soybeans on that and I'll make a good yield and then I'll pull soil samples again in the  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  fall and again in the spring and I've still got 120 units of available K within that range  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  of 10 or 20 units, whatever. They're still there. I didn't get it all, even though my  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  removal rate said I should have. If I had 120 units available and I used, supposedly  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  used 130 units on this crop, why do I still have 110 left in this fall soil sample?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  And why can you repeat that year for 20 years and still have the exact same numbers showing  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  up?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:39):**  Yeah, we've been doing it since 16 and I keep pulling the samples just to poke at my experts  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  now, but I've never gotten a sufficient answer on that. So I just don't pay much attention  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  to them anymore.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  There's good reason not to, but I think that the simplest way to summarize this is that  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  soil tests can be, and I'm not saying they always are, but they can be a very effective  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  fertilizer sales tool and that's how they're commonly used.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  I'm in 100% agreement with that. I think most of the things that we see are sales tools.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  Let's get back to talking about some of your crop management practices and cultural management.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  I've made the comment on many occasions that we don't really know what healthy plants actually  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  look like anymore. And I've been intrigued by how plants express themselves differently  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  when we give them permission to do so, when we put them in an environment and give them  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:37):**  the opportunity to really express themselves.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  I had a fascinating conversation a year or two ago with Dr. Norman Uphol from Cornell  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  University on the system of root intensification, where we talked about giving plants more spacing.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  And I know that this is something you've been playing with on your cotton crop. How have  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  you changed your cotton seeding rate and population and spacing and how has that affected yields  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  and how the plants have developed?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  Yeah, so I'm a big fan of Dr. Uphol. I actually am doing that same, well, not the system that  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:09):**  he describes, but the version that I can implement on my rice as well. And it's been a game changer.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  But when I started working with that Australian group, I didn't know anything about plant  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  intensification or root intensification. I was just trying to cut inputs that I was confident  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  in cutting, and fertilizer, herbicides, things that I picked up and seen on my own.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:33):**  Well, seed had never really crossed my mind. And these guys from Australia, the two in  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  particular, Ben Smith and Martin Hockie, I don't know if you've talked to either of them,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  but those guys came and visited my farm when we first started working with them. And they  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  were like, you're playing way too much cottonseed. And I wanted to agree with them because cottonseed  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:54):**  in Arkansas is expensive. That's a whole nother topic. The price of cottonseed in Arkansas  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  for the same exact bag and lot number in Texas, it's half in Texas that it is in Arkansas.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  And we can do a whole nother podcast on that one. That's just some criminal activity in  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  the ag world. But anyway, it's expensive in Arkansas. So I wanted to believe them that  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  I was putting out too much seed. So after that visit with them, I planted a field of  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  76 inch cotton, which I'm normally on 38 inch. So I eliminated a row. And I took my seed  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  in rate from about 40,000 to 20,000. I just basically just eliminated a row. And of course,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  according to them, that was still way too high, but I was a first time nervous as a  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  cat anyway, so I tried it. And I have never seen cotton plants like that. The best way  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  to describe it and how I've described it in talks in the past is if you've ever been in  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  a cotton field and you walk out to the turn row, if a seed or something had fallen off  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  the planter or whatever, and you've got one plant out there by itself, it is a monster.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  And it'll have 10 or 12 positions on the first five fruiting positions and then go to eight  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  and then go to six, just huge amounts of bowls. And that thing is just gigantic. Well, that's  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  what you're doing through the whole field. You're just making those plants through the  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  whole field. It just makes sense after you see it, but it is scary to do because everything  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  you've ever been told is not to do that. Who were you told that by? The guys selling the  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  seeds? Oh yeah. Yeah. Seed guys. Yeah. Actually, I know some seed guys who've done some studies.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  Of course, they'll never admit to it or say anything about it because they lose their  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  job, but they're seeing the same thing as we are, but they'll never admit it. So how  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  did this change your population? What was your seed age before and after? Yeah, so the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:49):**  first year I went from 40,000 to 20,000. So I cut it in half. So I went from $120 an acre  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  in seed to 60. And like I said, all I did was eliminate one row. I kept my planter set  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:01):**  up the same. I just didn't fill up every other box basically. And now at this point, I'm  
**[0:25:06-0:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  planting between 13 and 15,000. And that's about as low as I'm comfortable going currently.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:14):**  That may change in the future, but right now I'm still getting a little used to it. But  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  with all of that, our yields haven't changed much, if any. That first year, the field I  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  planted on 76, I planted June 1st, which for us is super late. Previous to that year, the  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:34):**  best June cotton I'd ever made was 950 pounds. And that field picked almost 1100 pounds.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  So that was pretty good confirmation that system was going to work. And as you have  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  reduced your population down to 13 to 15,000, have you also reduced your row spacing? Or  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  are you still at 76 inches? No, I'm still at 76 inches. I've actually got everything  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:25:56):**  involved with cotton. I've got a four row 76 inch wide cotton planter now. We've got  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:01):**  a 76 inch hooded sprayer for that. And then we've actually set our cotton picker up to  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  only pick 76 inch cotton. So we're fully committed to that row spacing. And there's no reason  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:12):**  for us not to be. The inputs are half or less, and we're making the same length. So there's  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  no reason to plant 38 inch cotton for us anymore. Yeah, if you maintain your yields and you  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  reduce your seed costs, I mean, my goodness, you're talking about a third of the seed costs,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  essentially. And with that, our fertility rates have gone way down. The last two years,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  we've put 300 pounds of ammonium sulfate at planting and that's it. And I'm not convinced  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  that that's not too much in because we're fighting with growth regulator all year to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:46):**  keep that plant under control. So I feel like I'm too high on that, but you know. Yeah,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:53):**  we have on the cotton crops that we have been managing with SAP analysis, we have lost track  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:26:59):**  of the number of fields and acres, but it's a large number that we have gotten PGRs to  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:03):**  zero. You know, it's really interesting. It's managing cotton with these high applications  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  of nitrogen and then high applications of PGRs is like trying to drive with one foot  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:12):**  on the brake and the other on the accelerator. It makes no sense. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  make sense when you're just sitting back and think about it. You know, we, we used to put  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  120, 130 units on cotton and just have to pour the growth regulator to it. And, you  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:27):**  know, now we're at half of that and still having to fight it hard. So we definitely  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  need to reduce some more. And the other key aspect is that every time we put on a PGR  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  application or put on a PICS application, we know that it essentially shuts down photosynthesis  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:43):**  for about a three to a five day period. So that has a negative impact on yield overall.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  We're much better off not putting it on in the first place. So how has this management  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  technique of the system of root intensification change your management of rice? You mentioned  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  that you're already also doing some things with rice. What does that look like? We're  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:01):**  going into our third year with this system. The first year it was just throwing darts  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  at a board. You know, we, we were messing with seed rates and things and row spacings.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  And anyway, we finally have settled on currently, now this is probably going to change again  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  this year. If we can get in earlier, we're going to reduce our rates some more, but this  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  year on average, we planted six pounds of hybrid rice and we're using a planter to singulate  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  the rice seed. When we were talking about how to set this up, we were envisioning, you  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:31):**  know, Dr. Ephoff's work and how they singulate one rice seed per square foot in that system.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:37):**  Now with our fire irrigation, we can't make our row pattern be 12 inches like that, but  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:44):**  we can get close. The closest we can get is 15 inches on top of our bed and then a 23  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  inch irrigation middle. Okay, so that's how our row pattern is. So on top of each 38 inch  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  bed, we'll have 15 inch wide rice and then we'll have a 23 inch irrigation for between  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:03):**  that. Would that be three 15s? No, it's two 15s and then a 23 inch. So we equal 38 inches  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  there. It's just 15, 23. And then instead of drilling rice with that, we're using a  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  precision planter to put one seed every however many inches that is on that spacing. And it  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  usually ends up around three or four inches between seed. Compared to what we normally  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:27):**  plant hybrid rice at, you know, 22 to 25 pounds. So we're at a quarter of the rate basically.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  It looks really thin for a while. It'll make you nervous, but man, by the end of the season,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:38):**  it's so thick and tillered out. It's just beautiful. And we had one of the best rice  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  crops we've ever had this year with this system. So the yield isn't going to be an issue. Our  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  biggest issue is trying to fight weeds early. One of the problems with some of our rising  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  areas is, you know, they're real heavy wet soil. So we're very limited on the cover crop  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  species that work. Annual rye works really good. And then we've got, you know, we try  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  to incorporate radish or some kind of other brassica in there as much as we can, but we  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  haven't found many legumes that do very well in that. Soybeans included, they just don't  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:12):**  handle that heavy wet soil. In the wintertime is the worst. So we're still struggling to  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  get that good cover to help us early with weed control. But we do have enough that we're  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  not spending more than we normally do on herbicides. It's just we're not able to cut them as much  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  as we'd like in rice. We're still figuring that out.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah, there's a couple of legumes that are not widely known that might be a fit in your  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  system. One that comes to mind is cura clover, but that's more for drought. There's another  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  one. It escapes me right now. I'll have to let you know what it is. But it's a low growing  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  clover that does particularly well in exactly the soil conditions that you described.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  Well, that would be great because we're struggling to find options in that. You know, aside from  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  annual rye, annual rye is gangbusters. But when you're trying to get some diversity,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  it gets tough.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:03):**  Yeah, and I know you're only a couple years into your experimentation with rye. But what  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:08):**  have your historical yields been like in the area? And what are yields like now? And I  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:12):**  know you said they're similar, but I'd just like to offer some context for people who  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:15):**  might have different environmental conditions.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  When we were watering with patties, you know, cotton plant is a real mixed soil, you know,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:24):**  the bottom ends of our fields will be good rice ground, you know, hold water well, the  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  tops will be sand, you know, have a vein of sand running through those fields. So floodier  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  irrigation for us was very costly. It was hard to hold a flood. The fur irrigation deal  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:39):**  has really changed everything for us on rice. So when we were doing flood irrigated rice,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  we'd grow just conventional varieties mainly, because we couldn't justify the cost of the  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:50):**  hybrid because we couldn't get everything we needed out of it to pay for it. But we'd  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  run 140 to 150 bushels of dry rice, which is not great. I mean, it's for us, it was  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  just barely a break even really the only reason we grew rice in that fashion and with that  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:06):**  yield is because nothing else would grow on that acre really so. But when we changed to  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  the fur irrigation, you know, we utilize the hybrids and we got those yields up to 165,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  170 dry, which was profitable, but just barely. But now since we've cut that seeding cost  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:24):**  to a quarter, and with that our fertility cost has gone down because our plants are  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  just so much more efficient at using what we give them because the root masses are huge.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:33):**  I mean, never seen roots on rice like that because they're usually pruned off because  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:37):**  of anaerobic conditions. But anyway, with this new system we're running like this year,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  our average dry was like 182, which for us is crazy. We had a few fields go over 200  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  dry, which we have only done a few times in our career. So I'm hoping this isn't an  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  off year. I'm hoping this is repeatable. So we'll see. But even if it's not, if I can  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:32:59):**  maintain that 165 to 170 at these input levels, then that's great.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  That is exciting. This is one of the aspects that Norma Nupov talks about. I mean, they  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:10):**  eventually changed the name to call it the system of root intensification to make it  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  applicable to more crops other than just rice. Can you give us a frame of reference? How  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  has root system expanded? Are they now twice the size of normal or what you saw historically  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  five times? What does it look like?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:25):**  You know, when we were planting with a drill on seven and a half or 10 inch spacing or  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:29):**  whatever, we'd have roots that were, I don't know, six, seven inches long, just a little  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:34):**  fibrous root system there. Just wasn't impressive at all. You could pull the rice out of the  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  ground really easy. And this is a good example of the impact it made on somebody who hadn't  
**[0:33:44-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  seen roots like that before. So I had a farmer come visit this summer because he was really  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  interested in what I was doing. I think he was just wanting to see how nuts I was. But  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:33:55):**  he said, how are you fertilizing this stuff? I said, well, this field in particular we  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  side dressed with a little 32% calcium and we just used a drop nozzle in the middle of  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:05):**  the row. He said those roots on top of those beds, how are they getting that fertilized  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:09):**  out there in the middle? Well, I reached down there and pulled a clump out, you know, and  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  it took some work. But I ripped roots up all the way across to the other bed, you know,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  38 inches away or whatever. So he said, oh, I get it. That's how they're getting that  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  fertilizer. So, you know, because he was wondering why I wouldn't put it right on top of the  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  bed there between the 15s and instead of just down in the furrow. And so I just showed him  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  why instead of trying to explain it to him, he was floored.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  So with these changes in population density and spacing with your cotton and the rice,  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:49):**  have you considered doing this with your other crops? How has your crop management changed  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  on your wheat and your soybeans over the years? I'm really intrigued by the relay cropping  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:34:59):**  that Jason Mok and John Kutz and all those guys are doing. I really want to try some  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  of that this year. And I want to do it on a 76 inch soybean. So I've got a plot this  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:12):**  year that I planted oats behind my wide cotton rows. And I want to band out a little strip  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:21):**  where my cotton row was and plant soybeans there and try a relay, a 76 inch relay soybean.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  That's just going to be an experiment. But corn, we've started messing with population  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  a lot on, you know, like under pivots where we have trouble keeping up with irrigation.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  Sometimes we've dropped our seeding rate. We hadn't really changed our spacings, but  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  I'd really like to change some spacings and get an understory of cover going and try to  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  incorporate my grazing animals there earlier, things like that. I just, I've got to figure  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:51):**  out how to not only make that work, I got to figure out how to explain to my landowners  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  what I'm doing and how it's going to affect them. So that's a balancing act. I got to  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  walk, but it's just part of it. Most of the things I've done early on, I just kind of  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  did them and everything turned out all right. So nobody, none of them got on to me, but  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  I try to explain to them before I do something crazy now that this is what I want to try  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:17):**  and this is why I'm trying. So they've been really receptive. The landowners that I have  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  really liked the fact that the changes that we're seeing in their soil, they know that  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  we're taking care of it. We're not just putting unnecessary inputs on it. They can see it,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  they can smell it, and they really like the differences that they've seen. So, landowner  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  relations have been really easy so far.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  CHUCK WALSH At the end of the day, the comment that you  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  made earlier still holds true, which is that you are still economically competitive and  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  you're still able to be profitable. As long as that remains the case, then, or even as  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:51):**  profitability improves, that just continues to put you in a better position.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  LEE HORTON That's been the key. They haven't taken any  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:36:57):**  big hits. So they trust me. Well, I mean, they trusted me before, but whenever you start  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:03):**  bucking the conventional production systems the way we have, they tend to get a little  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:10):**  nervous.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  CHUCK WALSH With all of the various changes in the incorporation  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  of cover crops, you mentioned at the beginning that you've also started including some livestock  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  as you are able. What does that look like for you?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  LEE HORTON That's an entertaining story. It was an educational  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  adventure as well. But we started hearing about livestock integration at all these meetings.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  And livestock down here, people just don't have it. You've got to go over to the hills  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  or in the river valleys and there's some guys over there that do row crops and cattle. And  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  then in the hills, it's all livestock. But in our part of the world, in the Delta, there's  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:47):**  just not many folks doing both things. I started hearing about the soil health benefits of  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  animal integration, how important it is or how important it can be. So we decided we  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  wanted to try some and we kind of had a plan. We planted some winter wheat the year before  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:04):**  and then behind the winter wheat, we planted a big cover crop mix. I don't know anything  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  about cows other than they taste good. So that's pretty well my knowledge of cows and  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:15):**  cattle and everything. So early on, I would have said that would have been a weakness,  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:21):**  but I'm not sure it is. I think I've avoided a lot of unnecessary expense because I know  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  nothing. So we planted this big cover crop blend and we've got a cover crop seed business  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  so I had access to all kinds of stuff and I just knew what those plants looked like  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  and I said, well, if I was a cow that would look tasty. So I'm gonna throw that in there.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  So that's how I came up with the mix we did. It was just a random assortment of everything.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  We planted this and man, it grew like crazy. I mean, it got big and lush and green and  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  anyway it was just really tall. So we had our food source on our field. We had 100 acres  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  planted like this. We put some paths in it, put our fence up. You know, we were doing  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:03):**  three acre paddocks to start with, whatever. Well, now we needed cows. So I got a buddy  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:09):**  that and his, one of his relatives that they farm cattle up in the hills and they have  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:15):**  a sale barn up in the hills in Arkansas. So I called them for help to go get some cows,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  you know, and they said, well, you just need to come to the sale barn and see how it works  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  and we'll figure it out. So I started going to the sale barn on Mondays. I was sitting  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:30):**  in there watching this thing go down and of course the auctioneers running 100 did nothing  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:36):**  and I can't understand what he's saying. So I'm just like, I don't have a clue what's  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:40):**  going on, but I noticed every Monday there was a bunch of old guys sitting on top of  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  that barn and man, they were buying and selling every day, you know, or every time I was there,  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:49):**  they were, they were shakers and movers, I guess you'd say. So I went up there and asked  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  to sit with them, told them what I was wanting to do and wanted to learn. Well, they were  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  all too excited to have a newcomer young man wanting to buy some cows that didn't have  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  any. So they, I started sitting with them and asking them questions and anyway, that  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  went on for a few Mondays and finally got ready to buy some cows, had my checkbook with  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  them in. I told them, I said, today's the day we're going to buy some cows today. And  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  they were all excited. Oh, there's some good ones out here. We'll get you fixed up today.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  Anyway, I had in mind that I was wanting to buy some cheap cows, you know, and I had a  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:26):**  picture of what cheap was in my head. Well, a lot started coming through the sale barn  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  there and it was beautiful. A lot of cows out there in the sky said, man, that right  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  there is a good starter kit. You need to jump on those. Those are good, healthy. They were  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  running, I don't know, $950 a head or something like that. And I thought, there's not any  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:44):**  money left for me in that. I just told him, I said, no, it's a little out of my price  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:48):**  range. I can't get very many for that. He said, oh, we understand. You just get the  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  start. We get it. We'll find you something. So we sat up there for a while longer. And  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:40:59):**  this other group came out looking a little rough. They were running about 700 head, something  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:04):**  like that, 725 was about where the bidding tabled out at. And they said, there's some  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  good money left on those cows. You need to get on those. And I did a little quick math  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:15):**  in my head and I said, no, no, still not what I'm after. It's a little bit high yet. At  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  this point, they're starting to get concerned because to them, those cows looked rough.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  But I was just, I couldn't make any money on that. So I hung in there for a while longer.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  Well, getting down towards the end of the day there, a lot of cows came out and I wish  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  I had the video pulled out for you to see it, but these things were just skin and bones.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  I'm talking about barely walking, standing just, anyway, the bidding got down to $200  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  a head before anybody said anything. And I was the first one to say something. I raised  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  my hand. And those guys looked at me like I'd lost my mind. They said, son, those things  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  won't make it back to Cotton Plant. They're going to die before they get there. I said,  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  but yeah, but think if they do, what kind of money I can make if they do? I mean, they're  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  going to eat, eat, eat. Anyway, a guy down in front of me bid me up to $250 just to see  
**[0:42:10-0:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  if I was serious. But anyway, we walked out of there with $42 a head and $250 a head.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:17):**  Two of them did die on the way back to Cotton Plant. So I didn't get them all back home.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  I had two dead ones there when I got there, which was unfortunate, but that's just the  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  way it goes. Anyway, we turned them out in that big tall cover crop and they disappeared  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  and we didn't see them for three days. And I got nervous. I was really nervous because  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  I didn't know if they busted the fence on the other side and were down in the bio or  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:40):**  what. But my brother, he's pretty sharp. He said, man, you know what we need? We need  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  a drone. We need to go get a drone. I said, that is a good idea. He said, I bet you we  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:50):**  can see them if we get a drone. So we ran over to Walmart and got us a drone, about  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:55):**  120 bucks, something like that, just a toy that took pictures, you know. So we brought  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:42:59):**  it back to the field and we took it up and we got one picture out of that drone before  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  a hawk came out of the sideline there and took it out. It just wasn't big enough to  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  scare him off, I guess. He destroyed that thing. We found it. We kind of saw where it  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:14):**  went down. We searched till we found it. We got one picture off of that drone, but we  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:19):**  had our cows there. I mean, they were still there. When I tell that story to people wanting  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  to get into it, I always tell them to buy a drone big enough to intimidate birds of  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:28):**  prey because mine didn't and it got destroyed. Man, you talk about a learning curve for somebody  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  who's never messed with cows before. It was a lot of fun. I figured out that sweet feed  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:41):**  is just like a drug for cows. You can get them to do anything if you get a bucket of  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  sweet feed and they know you got it. So we figured out how to move them pretty quick  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  with that stuff.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  So you started off, you told us this incredible story of starting off with these cheap cows.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:43:57):**  Now you have to tell us the conclusion. Did you end up selling them? What happened?  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:01):**  One buyer bought all of them and we sold them for $1,100 a head because by the time he got  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  there, they were beautiful. They were all open when we got them. We put a bull on them.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  So about 70% of them were pregnant and we actually had a few calves on the ground. So  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  a couple of them had to be pregnant when they got there. But we sold that lot for $1,100  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  a head.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:22):**  And how long did you have them?  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  We got them in in late October, 1st of November. Well, maybe it was early October that first  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  year. But anyway, we sold them out in March.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:32):**  Wow.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  Not too bad. Yeah.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  That's an incredible story, Adam. I like that story because it's perhaps an extreme example  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:40):**  and yet not really, but it shows the opportunity that exists. I've had Joel Salton here on  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:45):**  the podcast and other people in other conversations as well have described the tremendous opportunity  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:51):**  of just buying inexpensive cattle at the sale barn and selling them again at the sale barn  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  after you graze them for six months or four months or whatever the case is. And if you  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  do it right, there is a lot more money to be made there than growing almost any crop.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:05):**  Oh yeah. Yeah. Of course I hadn't repeated that margin. I repeated some pretty good margins,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  but nothing that extreme because I hadn't found cows that bad yet. Again, that was by  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  far the worst set I've ever found. If I could do that every winter, I don't know that I  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  wouldn't just plant cover crop and run cattle because per acre, that's a lot more profitable  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:27):**  than row crop.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  That's an incredible story, Adam. So when you think about all of the experiences that  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  you've had and the things that you've learned over the last decade, what is something that  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:36):**  you wish all other farmers knew?  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  I guess it's something that I wish I'd have known when I first started going is most of  
**[0:45:44-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:44):**  the information you get, it's disguised as information to help you, but it's information  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  to sell you something. That's kind of a cynical way to look at the world, but to me, that's  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  the facts. That's been my experience. We've had mergers and big companies packaged as  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:04):**  helping the farmer because of increased research budgets and blah, blah, blah. Well, it's never  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  been good for us. Seems like every time those guys get together like that, our prices end  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  up going up.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:16):**  Well, when you think about the price contrast between cottonseed in Arkansas and Texas,  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  that's enough to raise some eyebrows. And there's a hundred or a thousand examples like  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  that.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  You know, if you had to just put it in message form, just think about what everybody's telling  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:31):**  you kind of with a little bit of skepticism and think it through. If you see an advertisement  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  for one soybean seed that's going to give you 10 bushels more per acre, and then you  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  turn the page in a magazine and there's a competing brand that's going to give you 10  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:46):**  more bushels an acre than the one you just saw, you got to be smart enough to realize  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:50):**  that's a bunch of bull. Just don't fall for that stuff. And it's with herbicides, it's  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  with fertilizers, it's everything. Everything is targeted to sell you something. I wish  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  I'd have known that because they just push that yield narrative. You got to get your  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  yields up to make money because they're going to take everything they can. And the only  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  way for you to make is to increase yield. And the only way to increase yields is to  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  buy some more of this stuff.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  You know, when I think about the pathway that you've been on, Adam, and the way you describe  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  your transition at the beginning of this conversation, what you have really done, what you're really  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  describing is you are replacing inputs with management. In some cases, you're replacing  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:30):**  some inputs with others. Like you're replacing your fertilizer with cover crop seed to some  
**[0:47:35-0:47:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  degree. But many of the transitions that we're talking about are replacing certain inputs  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:42):**  with a different management style. And to me, this seems like such an obvious shift.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:47):**  Like if you had that choice, of course you would do that. But it's uncomfortable for  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:50):**  many of us because we have to begin adopting new ideas and new technologies and new practices  
**[0:47:56-0:47:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  that are unfamiliar and change is uncomfortable.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:47:59):**  And the change was uncomfortable for me also, but I'd gotten to a point where if we didn't  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  change, it was over anyway. So you don't have to wait till you get in that position to do  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:11):**  these things. And I would recommend not getting in that position to do these things. Don't  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:15):**  change because you absolutely have to. You're pass or fail then, there's no wiggle room.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  If you're still got some equity in doing, making it, you can make these changes and  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  still have a little room for error, which are going to come. I mean, that's going to  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  happen. It's not all successes. Well, I've had plenty of failures because of the financial  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:37):**  situation I was in when I started. Those failures, the pressure of those was 10X what it should  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:43):**  have been. If I'd had some room to make a mistake without losing everything, then I  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  wouldn't have, it wouldn't have been so hard just mentally, I guess.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  Adam, what is your vision for the future for your operation? How do you see your operation  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  evolving and management practices evolving in the future?  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:01):**  Our ultimate goal is to continue to downsize. So at the peak of our farming, we were just  
**[0:49:06-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:06):**  a little over 10,000 acres. And that was another thing we did because we kept hearing, you  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  know, the only way farmers are going to make it anymore is to get bigger, get bigger. You  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  got to get bigger because your margins are so thin, you got to have more acres. So we  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  fell into that trap. And so we were a little over 10,000 at our peak and now we're down  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  to 7,500. And in the future, we want to be quite a bit smaller than that. Our goal is  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  to get smaller and to do more things on those acres, like continue with the animal integration.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  And my papa always said, you need to have a farm you can work, not one that will work  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  you. And I've had one that's been working me for a while and I'm trying to get down  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:49):**  to where I'm working it now. So, and we're actually getting to the point after all those  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  things that have happened to us where we're filling those holes in and we're getting to  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  where we can do those things. We can cut acres loose and focus a little harder on the ones  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:02):**  that we're keeping. That's our goal is to get smaller.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:06):**  I don't think I've ever heard anyone express that as a goal before. I mean, I've heard  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  people talk about the desire to go in that direction, but not definitively saying we  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  want to get smaller. Adam, I think that's quite exciting, actually.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:18):**  Oh, it is for me. My observation has been that there is usually  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:26):**  a correlation that as farm size goes down, profitability goes up when they are managed  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  well. I'm talking about total dollar amount, not per acre, but total dollar amount.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  I agree completely with that because 19 was a year where we didn't get the whole farm  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:42):**  planted. It rained so much that we had to prevent plant about half of our farm. And  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  at that time, we were about 8,500 acres. So we've been scaling down every year a little  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:52):**  bit. Man, the crops we made on the half the size of where we normally were, were so much  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:50:58):**  better than normal because we had time to really focus in on things that were happening.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  I believe you are absolutely right. I believe total dollar amount, we could do that on half  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:10):**  the acres that we've got now just by doing more things on those acres.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  Yeah, I see that awfully often. There's a lot of appeal in driving big equipment and  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:24):**  being able to claim lots of acres and stuff. There's a strong ego boost there that drives  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  a lot of people to their detriment. Adam, this has been a wonderful conversation. I've  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  really enjoyed it. What final thoughts do you have to share with other growers?  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:38):**  I wish I had a catchy slogan for it, but it's just not buying into the fear of, you know,  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:45):**  you got to have more acres or more yield. Just don't buy into the fear. That's what  
**[0:51:51-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:51):**  I've come to realize. I don't listen to that stuff anymore and I just ignore it and things  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  have gotten better. The less I listen to it, the better things it gets.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  You know, Adam, you hit the nail on the head with that slogan. I like it because you used  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  the word fear. You identified it as fear. And we often don't want to acknowledge that  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:09):**  what motivates us is based on fear, even though it really is. That's very powerful.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  Yeah. Oh, it's definitely fear. I mean, it's, how many times have you heard if you don't  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  put this much fertilizer out, your yields are going to tank. I mean, I've heard that  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:22):**  so many times. I mean, I've heard it enough now that I'm numb to it, but it used to really  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  scare me, you know.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:28):**  Wonderful. Well, thank you, Adam. I really enjoyed this conversation. Thank you for sharing  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:33):**  your wisdom and knowledge. I'm sure many people will find it valuable and I look forward to  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/adam-chappell.mp3#t=0:52:37):**  speaking with you again soon.

**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/3-things-to-do-when-plants-dont-respond-to-nutrient-applications/#t=0:03:04):**  in very challenged situations, to turn a soil and crop situation around very quickly.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/3-things-to-do-when-plants-dont-respond-to-nutrient-applications/#t=0:03:11):**  And we've learned that there are three major characteristics that define many of these

**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/3-things-to-do-when-plants-dont-respond-to-nutrient-applications/#t=0:03:36):**  So there is this idea within agronomy and plant nutrition that primary focus and emphasis  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/3-things-to-do-when-plants-dont-respond-to-nutrient-applications/#t=0:03:43):**  needs to be on applying the nutrients that are missing.

**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/3-things-to-do-when-plants-dont-respond-to-nutrient-applications/#t=0:04:29):**  Another nutrient excess that is creating an imbalance and a nutrient deficiency of the

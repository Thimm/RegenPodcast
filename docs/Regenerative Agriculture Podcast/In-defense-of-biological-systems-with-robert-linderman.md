### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we talk about agronomic  science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil health,  and ultimately also regenerate public health.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:16):**  Today I have a guest on the podcast that I've been wanting to have for some time.  When I was introduced to him the first time or told about him the first time, I was told  that this individual is the senior grandfather of mycorrhizal fungi research and developing  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  these suppressive soils and that very few people, fewer people know about him and deserve  to know about him.  So today I'm excited to have Dr. Robert Linderman from the USDA here from Corvallis, Oregon.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  Bob, thank you very much for agreeing to be here and sharing some of your knowledge and  wisdom.  I'd love to hear more about your story and background.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  How did you come to do all the research that you've done in developing disease suppressive  soils and with mycorrhizal fungi associations?  Tell us a little bit about your story and your background and how you came to this spot.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Well thank you very much John, I appreciate the opportunity.  My history goes back a long ways as you already know.  I started out as a zoologist, a pre-med student.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  I went to Fresno State College and became interested in plants actually along the way.  Went to graduate school, eventually went to graduate school at UC Berkeley and worked  with some world renowned people on diseases and pathogens.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  In 1967 I graduated from there and went to the USDA ARS Research Facility in Beltsville,  Maryland.  There were people there that I got to know but one of them happened to be a person interested  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  in mycorrhizal fungi and I got to thinking about mycorrhizal fungi in a broader context  and kind of became a student of that at that time.  But then I was transferred to Corvallis, Oregon where there were other world renowned researchers  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  working on mycorrhizal fungi and I was still a student of that subject.  And it just kind of went from there.  I began to study it and say well this is one of the most important components of the rhizosphere  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  of plants that would affect plant diseases, especially root diseases.  And it kind of went from there.  I began to study all the interactions that occur in that zone next to the roots and became  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  interested in the concept of the potential of biological control to control those pathogens  in that zone right next to the roots.  So the rest of my career kind of related to that and I addressed specific pathogens on  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  nursery crops but always had the idea that some of those pathogens could be controlled  rather than with chemicals they could be controlled with biological systems.  It's a matter of how to develop and find the systems and make them work.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  And that's been kind of a struggle ever since.  There's a certain reluctance to consider the concept of biological control by many growers  because they already have their systems kind of worked out and they kind of know and then  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  there's a lot of chemicals that people can sell them that would address certain diseases.  And so they kind of pushed aside the idea of biological control.  Well that's all changing in current times because there's a lot more concern about chemicals  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  being used from both a standpoint of human health as well as damage and impact on the  environment.  So there are a lot of companies that have kind of shifted a little bit into biological  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  control developing products and there are a lot of biological control products out there.  I think the real problem is those people that might want to consider biological control  really don't know how to get started.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  And the key is in my opinion is not to necessarily try to change the whole biology of the soil  but to change the biology of the soil right next to the roots and on the roots.  So that means prevent the disease before it ever happens.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:14):**  And that's kind of the thrust of everything that I am thinking now and things that I've  done.  And that includes mycorrhizal fungi and the organisms that associate with them in sort  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  of a team effort to potentially suppress pathogens and enhance plant growth and health.  That's kind of where I am right now.  I retired from the USDA in 2007 so I've been retired for almost 13 years.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  I'm a private consultant right now with nurseries working on these various things that we're  talking about trying to have the nursery people be able to control diseases that they get.  And as we talked the other day, the potential for field crops where transplants are being  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  used is still part of the nursery industry.  We could manage those populations on the roots of plants in the nursery before they ever  go to the field.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  And that's kind of a concept that we could explore further.  And I'll stop talking there and maybe we can go to some questions that you have.  Well there's no shortage of questions that I have for you, that's for sure.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  So just some of the things that you've mentioned in your quick introduction, a number of pieces  that you brought up that I want to dive a bit deeper on.  But let's perhaps start with the question of if you are a commercial grower and you  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  have a desire to develop disease suppressive soils and to manage some of the pathogens  that you have challenges with a given crop, how do you begin?  Where's the start?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  Where's the starting point?  And how can you, there's also a lot of questions about the broad range of biocontrol products  that are available which are effective, which are not effective.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  We know it's very context dependent.  So how do you make the decisions about what to choose and where do you begin?  Well let's just say you're a grower with some specific disease problem.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  You have to consider the products that are out there available to you right now that  would address those pathogens, that specific disease.  I'll just look at your list and think of some of the kinds of things like, I'll just say  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  Fusarium or let's go to Rhizoctonia.  How could you control Rhizoctonia?  You have to ask the question how and when does Rhizoctonia get in because of the disease?  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  Is it present in the field soil that you're going to plant into?  And if so, it would be a good idea to be able to take a product where the label says this  organism or series of organisms works to control Rhizoctonia and then as a matter of delivering  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  that product to the site where it needs to be to work in a timely way.  That is before the pathogen ever gets to the root.  So that means pre-inoculation, that means inoculating transplants or inoculating an  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  onion bulb so that there's already a population, it's like immunizing the plant before it ever  gets exposed to the pathogen.  So any grower can then look at the label and sometimes the labels are going to be maybe  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  inclusive of the pathogen that you're considering and that doesn't necessarily mean that it's  going to work on the strain of the pathogen that you are faced with in your soil.  So there's that kind of specificity that can be a problem.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  So the real way to test that and there are not many people doing this kind of thing would  be to isolate the pathogen that you have in your field and test it against the product  that you're going to be using.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  You can do that in a Petri-Deuce test or you can develop some other kind of a plant bioassay  that simulates what would happen in the field.  I'll take an example.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  There's a product called Triathlon.  The label says it will work against Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Phytophthora, and Pythium, about  five different pathogens.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  Question would be whether or not that product has enough of whatever works against Rhizoctonia  to actually do the job.  If you load the plant system up in advance of being exposed to the Rhizoctonia, then  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:10):**  you have the best chance of succeeding.  That's where most growers are not quite in tune to the timing of the whole thing and  where to put the material and when.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  Sometimes it doesn't do any good to add the product to a big volume because the population  doesn't maintain itself in the right place at the right time to do the suppression of  the pathogen.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  So the grower needs to consider all those kinds of things when developing a product.  Maybe there is no product that controls the pathogen that you're concerned with.  For example, I'm not really sure.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  Macrophomina is a pathogen that causes charcoal rot.  Are there products out there already that would be addressing that pathogen?  I can't answer that.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  I could look it up, but I don't really know the answer right now.  But let's say there isn't one.  There are ways, and this is back to the paper I mentioned earlier to you John about strategies  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  for finding and characterizing biocontrol agents.  You could go to the field and look for examples where somehow the pathogen didn't do its job  and there's escapes.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  You may be able to isolate a pathogen and its antagonist from that field and then develop  that.  Well, somebody has to do that commercially in order for you to do it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  The farmer is not going to be able to do it themselves.  That ends up being a problem and that's kind of where we are right now.  We may not have the specifics that are needed for that particular strain of the pathogen  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  in that specific field.  That point, that's where some farmers will say it's too complicated, it's too much trouble,  and I don't have anybody to go to to help find that organism and develop it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  And so they go to chemicals as the best choice they have or some product that they might  try to see if it works.  Bob, you hinted that timing of product application is really important and that my understanding  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  is that it needs to be applied before the potential pathogen actually produces an infection.  Is it necessary always to apply materials at planting or even before planting in order  to produce the control effect that we're looking for?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  Well for sure and there are really good examples of why this is really essential but in almost  every case that I can think of to get the protection there before the pathogen gets  there should be the best thing no matter what.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  The question is, depending how the farmer farms and whether they're seeding or transplanting  or planting bulbs or whatever, to treat that material where the infection is going to happen  to have something there waiting for the pathogen when it tries to get into the plant is the  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  best chance.  It's like immunizing a child for infections that might come.  You build up some kind of resistance and the resistance is in biological form.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  If you wait until the pathogen already has started it's pretty hard to chase it down.  It's like closing the gate after the cows are out.  It's just a hard thing to do and maybe totally successful.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  And that's in fact the outcome for many people.  I tried that material but it didn't work.  Well when did you put it on?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  Or where did you put it?  I can give you an example of the mycorrhizal fungi for example.  Did you put it on the root system or where the roots would run into it?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:24):**  No.  I put the fungus in a Ganyu spreader and spread it over the field on the top.  Well it needed to be down where the roots were so if you failed that's good reason for  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  it.  You didn't put it where it needed to be in a timely way.  And the same would be true with any biocontrol agents.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  And of course there are ways of building up and this is a point to make too.  Almost all soils have some antagonistic organisms to most pathogens.  They're just there in too low a population to do what they need to do in a timely and  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:58):**  effective way.  But if you can find them, build them up to a higher population so they dominate the site  that infections are going to occur in, then you have a good chance.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  The disease called crown gall is a bacterium.  You must use the biocontrol agent to protect the wounds that that pathogen gets in.  That's the normal way it gets in.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:18):**  And if you don't protect the wounds, then you get crown gall.  It's as simple as that.  And so you just have to find the organism, put it in the right place at the right time  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:30):**  to prevent the disease.  The key for me in all of these things is prevention.  Prevent the disease before it ever happens and that's the same concept with immunization.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  We prevent the disease from occurring.  Bob, so far we've been having this conversation in the context or in framing it around the  use of commercial products, which are valuable and necessary tools and more of them are being  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  developed and going through the registration process all the time.  What are the cultural management strategies and cultural management practices that growers  can use to enhance the development of disease suppressive organisms in their soil profiles  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  and shift their soil profile from one that favors the expression of pathogens to one  that suppresses it?  Well, there are certain substrates that you can add to soil that will at least increase  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:22):**  the biological diversity.  Assuming that the biology is soil, there are some components that are there that could  be effective in the biocontrol process.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  If you build them up in population, you put some organic matter, for example, in the soil  or chitin in the soil, you build up specific organisms that like that substrate, like the  actinomycetes like chitin because they can produce an enzyme that breaks it down.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  So that population of organisms will build up specifically or preferentially on a chitin  substrate.  Other organisms don't like chitin so much, they aren't going to build up very much.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  So you can kind of shift the population in your favor in that particular case.  But adding organic matter in general will increase the microbial diversity of the soil.  And there will be a greater population of organisms that could suppress the pathogen,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:17):**  but they're also there competing with everything else that like that substrate, that compost,  organic matter.  And so it's difficult to favor the biocontrol agents that you want with a general amendment  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  like that.  And you can kind of get to the idea that if you have a greater diversity, and then you  have some selective pressure that allows those organisms that you want to be recruited from  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  the population and given preferential treatment, then you've shifted the population in favor  of the organisms that you want.  And one of the things that does this, and you've read the paper I sent you on the mycorrhizosphere,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  said, when you have mycorrhiza on a plant, they help recruit antagonistic organisms from  the background soil so that the population of antagonists in the presence of mycorrhiza  is greater than if you don't have mycorrhizae.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:14):**  So that's one way of preferentially shifting the population to something that you want,  a team of organisms that some of which are antagonistic to a range of pathogens.  And what builds up against one pathogen is not necessarily the ones that build up against  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  another pathogen.  But the concept of mycorrhiza association stimulating antagonistic organisms in general,  thereby increasing the antagonistic potential against a range of path, soilborne pathogens  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  is very good.  We have growers that we're working with for producing very high value crops.  And as fumigation becomes less and less of a viable commercial option, many people are  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  asking the question, what is the fastest route that we can take?  There's no holds barred.  Budget is not a limitation.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  We're willing to do whatever it takes to develop soil that can suppress these organisms.  What's the pathway that you would advise them to use?  What's the combination of cultural management practices and products that they should use  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  to achieve the optimal results?  And we can use cesarean in soils as an example or cesarean in strawberries or macrophomina.  I'm not working specifically with those, but I think you have to, even if you were  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  to choose a biological product and you add that in a system where there's a population  potential to be built up by some organic substrate, that is you could add organisms and favor  them by having some food material there to build up a population of them in advance of  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:54):**  planting.  That would be the key.  And of course the other thing, you and I have talked before about, and you've written  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  a lot about, improving soil health.  That's one way you can increase the microbial diversity and therefore the soil health.  But if you wanted to really increase the population next to the root system where the pathogen  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  is about to invade, then you probably need to inoculate the profit of the plant or put  the organism right where the roots of that plant will come in contact with it very quickly.  That could be a drench of organisms, some product for example, right into the system  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  where the plant is going to have to grow, where the roots will develop.  And if they get associated with the root system, wherever the root system goes, the organisms  will follow it.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  They'll stay with it unless you do something that's pretty drastic.  And sometimes those treatments are drastic.  They may also be trying for biological control but didn't give up on that or decide to  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  add some chemicals that may put the whole system on hold or suppress it.  I'm not sure I got to the right answer there, what you were specifically asking.  You have told me a lot in your blog about the fertility and the kinds of changes that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  would occur with different kinds of fertility.  And there are surely examples where that kind of approach has shifted the population in  such a way that antagonists are favored.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  Here's an example on wheat take-all for example, here in Oregon, a palisade many years ago  found out that potassium chloride could be added and shift the population toward antagonistic  pseudomonads.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:42):**  There are other people that have done the same kind of thing with seed meals and things  like that.  And you increase the antagonistic population, then you get less disease.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  That will be happening specifically with macrophomina and strawberries or any other crop.  I'm not even sure I know the answer to that, but there could be certain cover crops that  might favor the buildup of antagonists.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  And you need to be able to measure the change in antagonistic potential as a result of whatever  you did, whether it was plant a different cover crop.  There are examples where certain crops favor the buildup of antagonists against the pathogen  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  that was going to occur on the next plant.  Those kinds of things are probably known, but not necessarily known by the farmers that  are going to try to practice it unless their fathers or grandfathers told them this is  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  the right way to do it.  Surely many of those stories out there.  There are so many of those stories out there, and this is exactly the type of conversation  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  I've been hoping to have with people and to draw out because the story, the example you  just shared of using potassium chloride to increase the antagonists for take-all disease  in wheat.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  There are so many cultural management practices that are known collectively by people in agriculture  and horticulture to how to control a specific disease organism in a specific context.  But with cultural management practices, I would consider this a cultural management  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  practice, using tools, using specific forms of nutrients and specific types of products  to shift the soil microbial profile is knowledge that is out there, but it's not common knowledge.  It's become, well vested interests, I believe, have, and just human nature, it's been easy  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  to just buy a product and a jug and then a fungicide or something like that and go fix  the problem.  In reality, we have the collective knowledge amongst us to prevent a lot of these problems  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  from showing up in the first place, if only it were more widely known.  Well, all these things are kind of specific examples, and so it's really difficult to  find one common denominator that would apply to many systems, that is, what cover crop  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  would build up antagonists to a specific pathogen, whatever the problem is.  You mentioned the other day a phytophthora problem on peppers, I guess it was.  You have to know what the strain of the pathogen is and what that field soil history is, and  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  I don't think there's anybody who collected all the information on any specific crop as  to what cover crop should be used to prevent such and such a disease.  It's known in some cases, but not a lot.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  And frankly, the emphasis by research people and farmers and agronomists, horticulturists,  has not been to find those organisms and develop that strategy or that protocol for growing  your crop.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  Unfortunately, I think the information could be there, but it's buried a little bit in  all kinds of literature or no literature.  I can tell you the potassium chloride story, for example, on take-all was not published  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  in a Refereed Journal paper.  Something was either in abstract or some local thing, and I happened to hear about it, because  I knew Bob Powelson.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  But those kinds of things are buried in the literature, and that's a really unfortunate  kind of thing in my own case, too.  I've published papers that are buried in Refereed Journals, but the farmer never sees them.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  How do you get that material translated and put into a language that somebody can read  easily and say, this is how I'm going to approach it, or talk to somebody who will guide them  through that?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  And I'm not sure there are that many people out there that would be in that category.  What are some examples of some of the papers that you've written and that you think farmers  would really value knowing about but that aren't widely known?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:49):**  That's a hard question, because I kind of know what the papers are.  I went through a process fairly recently, since I'd worked on using onions as a test  organism for mycorrhizal fungi for many papers.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  I decided those papers were all buried in the scientific literature, and maybe I should  collect them and summarize some of those papers and put it in the journal called Onion World,  where the farmers would actually read it, hopefully.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  Well, I published that paper, and it went into Onion World, but then I have no idea  whether the onion growers actually read it.  And I know that this is where you might have come from, too, because you were involved  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  in this process we're going through right now, plus your blog, to try and translate  and transmit some of that information to growers who need it right now.  They need to have it translated.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  They need to have it put into perspective that they can understand and try to apply.  And I don't think there's a lot of that kind of thing.  There's not enough of that happening.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  Well, it certainly, there's many days for me when it appears to be an almost overwhelming  task, because when you start getting into some of these papers, I become extremely excited  by the implications of connecting the dots, what a piece of research or a certain paper  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  means when we connect it to the rest of the knowledge base that is out there.  So then you start following the bibliography, and all of a sudden you discover that this  paper cites an additional 100 other papers, of which 20 appear to be really exceptional.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  And it's just an ever-expanding list with no end.  Well, I'm hearing what you say, and I totally agree.  And you asked earlier what paper, even ones that I've published, that I could point to  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  that might be something that would tease growers into thinking about biological control systems.  And the paper I just mentioned on strategies for detecting and characterizing biocontrol  systems for soil-borne pathogens is probably one that would maybe get growers, if they  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:08):**  were at that paper, to look down there and say, oh, here's an example.  I've got crowndall, or I've got take-all, or I've got root rot of beans.  And there's some grower, people that we referred to in that paper, that did such and such.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  They grew certain crops before beans.  Well, I've never done that, so maybe that's something to try.  But it gets them thinking about how they can figure out what parts and what strategy they  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  need to use for their specific crop.  And of course, there are farmers that grow different crops.  I mean, in your area, a lot of corn and soybeans are grown, but there are also all kinds of  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:49):**  vegetable crops and pumpkins and on and on.  Then you have to consider the specifics of the pathogen.  And that's where a lot of people will get off, because they're talking to agronomists  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  and horticulturists, maybe, and not necessarily working with a pathologist that can deliver  some specifics about the pathogen and what they need to consider.  There are pathologists that are out there in your areas that, oh, Don Huber's a really  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  good example of somebody who knows those crops and knows those systems.  You have to talk to them, but there's a few Don Hubers out there.  I want to say that there are very few people who take a systemic approach.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  And I'm coming to realize that there are many people, actually, who do take a very systemic  approach to trying to understand these problems.  But they are still in the great minority, it's still very easy.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:40):**  One of the challenges of the scientific method being brought into agriculture has been the  easy method of doing research is to attempt to do single factor analysis, identify a specific  factor, change it, and observe what happens.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  And of course, agricultural ecosystems are extraordinarily multifactorial.  There's so many different factors that all work together and collaborate in these systems,  things that we don't even fully understand yet.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  And within that context, our conversation, to some degree, we've been talking a little  bit about systems, we've been talking about cultural management practices and products  and so forth.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  But I'd love to hear a specific example.  Let's say we're dealing with phytophthora issues on a specific crop.  What are all the different tools or combinations of tools that you could bring into a system  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  to all try to have an influence on phytophthora?  We can supply specific products, we can grow cover crops in advance of the crop.  What are some other things that we can do?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  And also, parallel to that question is, are there combinations of products that we should  consider trying, fomalinoculants combined with bacterial inoculants combined with biocinulants  and so forth?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:51):**  What is this a true systemic approach to solving the issue rather than just taking a single  factor point and shoot approach?  Let me point you to that paper we're talking about on strategies and refer you to the system  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  called the Ashburner system in Australia.  Phytophthora run rot on avocados.  Ashburner was a farmer who knew he had phytophthora and his neighbors had phytophthora.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  Right next to his fields were the rainforest areas and the phytophthora was there but it  didn't cause any disease.  What was different about those two systems?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  Ashburner decided that he was going to bring that system into his orchard.  So he started growing a cover crop of material called lab lab and he didn't just chop it  up and work it into the soil.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  He chopped it and laid it over and built up a thick layer around his trees.  He added lime.  The system is described in that paper by the way.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  That's what I'm saying.  And Ashburner basically brought his trees back into production by that whole system.  He didn't understand or know all the other components.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  He didn't know anything about mycorrhizal fungi which could have been involved.  But the suppressive soils, he created suppressive soils and the suppressiveness had to do with  organisms that would suppress the development of zoospores of the pathogen.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  If the pathogen doesn't develop zoospores that swim to the roots and infect it then  you don't get root infection.  Pretty soon you have enough roots that are healthy and being protected to sustain tree  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  and those trees came back to production and he went on his merry way.  He did that whole system from that point on.  There are other people that have examples that we've heard of in that paper where  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  they've done this for years and years and they don't have bean root rot for example  or they don't have crown gall.  In each case, you mentioned phytophthora on pepper.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  That would have to be done to build up the antagonistic potential of that field over  time.  That could be a real problem because the grower may grow peppers one year and decide, well  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:03):**  okay I had a lot of disease I'm not going to grow peppers there anymore.  So it's not like you have a sustained build up like you would with take all decline, something  systemic.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:12):**  And when you get down to the whole thing with a few exceptions, most all the plants on the  earth form mycorrhizae.  Mycorrhizal fungi for me have become the key component and we still don't have people  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi even though they may be the orchestrator of really good  things to come including building up antagonistic potential.  Not only mentioning the increase in uptake of phosphorus and other nutrients, those kinds  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  of things are what people talk about but there's a whole shift in the biology of a plant internally  and externally if you have mycorrhizal fungi.  That includes building up antagonists, nitrogen fixtures, but not many people are studying  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  it.  So we don't really know all the things that could be happening as a result of forming  mycorrhizae and you have to do it early.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:07):**  It's again the same with the protection against pathogens.  You have to get it there before or as early as you can and that means how and when I can  apply the organism or that product to get mycorrhizal established as early as possible  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  to therefore benefit thereafter.  We just don't have enough products and people doing that.  You could be inoculating and this is back to what do you inoculate?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  Well in my case I can inoculate cuttings.  I want to sanitize the cuttings and then inoculate them with beneficial organisms like antagonistic  organisms just to prevent against specific disease.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  But if you were to take the whole package, mycorrhizal fungus plus all the associated  organisms some of which, many of which might be antagonistic to pathogens, that would be  a good approach, a good systemic approach.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  But it's an expense and many growers are probably looking at that expense and saying well I  don't know if that's going to be worth it or not.  So they almost talk themselves out of trying it.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  You know what I find interesting about the comment that you just made is this last week  I was at an event in Iowa and corn growers have lost my desire to, I enjoy working with  corn less than I do with other crops, I'll just state that in a very kind way because  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  of the agronomic approach that it's commonly taking.  What I found so intriguing is that growers have become so locked into a system.  They know that they're going to lose money when they plant corn seeds in the ground.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  They know that's a foregone conclusion and yet they, the week that I was there they were  considering planting the following week to go out and put on a $40 an acre fungicide  application that is completely unwarranted.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  There is no need for it.  There are no pathogens present.  There is no disease present and there's none in the forecast particularly.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  But the only reason they're putting it on is because they've been told they need it  so that they don't lose any more money than they're already losing.  And so I find that approach, that way of thinking about product applications, what if we were  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  to think about our biological products that way?  What if we were to think about its mycorrhizal fungi and I can't afford not to put these  on otherwise I might lose more money than I'm already losing.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  Anyway that was just kind of a twisted reality.  Made me think that I might have gone through the looking glass so to speak and have been  in a very different world.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  And then also before we go on to other topics I wanted to, for all of our listeners, I'll  be sharing the paper that Bob has referenced a couple of times.  I've read it several times over the years and I'm really fascinated by the ash burner  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  example that is described in this paper because the way that it's defined and described is  quite interesting in the paper is described as developing a mulch layer on the soil surface  to foster the development of microbial communities and also to supply abundant calcium and then  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  a very key phrase to supply all the nitrogen in the form of ammonium.  That to me means the presence of a reducing environment in the soil profile not an oxidizing  environment.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  It's all part of the system.  It's all part of the system.  I'm not sure how Ashburner thought that through and developed the system.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  Actually Ken Baker who was one of the co-authors on the paper, he was one of my professors  at Berkeley, he actually knew Ashburner and had been to Mount Tambourine and seen the  system.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:51):**  And by the way I have had slides, aerial slides over his farm that show his farm next to the  neighbor's farms and his trees were growing and theirs weren't and other aspects of that.  There were certain things that Ashburner didn't know anything about.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  For example in that layer that he built up as a mulch he developed humic materials near  the surface.  The most decomposed there were more human materials there.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  Well what's the role of human materials in the whole process in terms of nutrients and  in terms of organisms and the whole thing?  What was the mycorrhizal status of the avocado trees?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  Did they become colonized by mycorrhizal fungi and therefore they attracted some of the antagonists  that would suppress the pathogens and that part was known either.  But the system worked.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:42):**  That's the beauty of it.  His system worked.  He was the only thing that mattered.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:47):**  He probably didn't, I don't know if he read scientific papers, but he heard and talked  to other people like Ken Pegg over there and got some advice on putting calcium in there  and liming the soil and don't just chop up the organic matter but lay it over and build  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  up this thick layer around the trees.  That was a nifty system.  Now how many orchards could be doing that?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  But right now we're orchards on the soil surface.  They're clean.  They've used herbicides.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  They've used all kinds of things to make it easier for them to get a tractor in there  I guess.  Ashburner, he was able to pick avocados but he probably couldn't get a tractor around  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  the tree because of the mulch which he didn't want to disturb.  So the farmer has to kind of consider a whole bunch of things.  Each case is individual.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  If you were to go into depth and say, okay, here's a farmer that has phytoarthic capsulacy  on peppers.  What is the cultural practice that they're using right now and what could be changed  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  to reduce the incidence of that disease if they wanted to grow peppers there?  They could go out a year or two and grow a cover crop of something that would build up  antagonistic organisms to that particular pathogen.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  They may or may not be willing to do that just because of the economics.  Corn growers know they're going to lose money as you just said.  And so they put something on as insurance and there are all kinds of people put things  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  on as insurance against an accident that may never happen or the potential for it to happen  might not have even been there.  They spend a lot of money doing that.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  They need something else and say, well, why don't you spend your money some other way?  You and I might try to convince them that to go a biological way would be better than  putting a chemical on that would do nothing but disappear, not have any effect on anything  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  except screw up the populations of something.  Yeah, it actually has a negative effect instead of a positive effect on the overall system  over particularly over time.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  You've touched on mycorrhizae and you've mentioned how they recruit antagonistic organisms that  suppress pathogens.  And I think the conversation around mycorrhizal fungi, solubilizing phosphorus and increasing  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  phosphorus supply and so forth is becoming a fairly well-known conversation.  That this interaction that is effective in being a recruiting agent, if you will, is  not as widely known.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  Can you expand on that a little bit more and tell us more about what's happening and what's  going on?  I'd love to expand on it.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  The two papers I sent you also have to do with that very concept, the mycorrhizosphere  concept.  And while those papers are complicated for many people to read, the concept is pretty  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  straightforward.  Unfortunately, the only place that I published that information was in those two chapters.  They were talks that I gave and I've included information there on increasing the antagonistic  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  potential in the presence of mycorrhizae that didn't happen in the absence of mycorrhizae.  That's the key point.  And while most people think about mycorrhizae in terms of phosphorus uptake potential, that's  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  only part of the story.  This other part is maybe even more important.  The same with mycorrhizae fungi increasing the aggregation in soil, improves the tilt  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  of the soil.  That's not so widely appreciated.  But this idea of recruiting organisms from a background to build up populations at a  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  high enough level to suppress a pathogen so the antagonistic potential is increased, that  should be a good thing.  In all cases, we ran about six or seven different pathogens and in each case the antagonistic  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  potential was increased against each of those pathogens, but the organisms that might have  been involved for one pathogen wouldn't necessarily be the ones that are involved for another  pathogen.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  But collectively, the antagonistic potential overall in that assay system, which also was  never published, was increased.  So that's kind of a general statement.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  You can increase the antagonistic potential of any of its pathogens by having mycorrhizae  present to begin with.  So you put the mycorrhizae in, the organisms are there.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  They come running and they get recruited to the team.  And then if you do that enough, you have increased the antagonistic potential of the soil.  So when you plant your next crop, there are more antagonists that are there to keep the  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  pathogen from doing anything or doing much.  Fundamentally, what you're describing is that if you are successful, when you are successful  in developing robust mycorrhizal populations, then in reality we don't even need to know  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  all of the specific antagonists or specific diseases, that those can be recruited from  the soil and we develop a general resistance as a result of the mycorrhizal recruitment.  Well, let me just say what the technique was that we developed.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  If you had a soil from around the mycorrhizal system versus control without mycorrhizae,  we isolated 48 different looking bacteria from those two systems and then we challenged  that with a pathogen.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  We used to lay theopsis, black root rot pathogen, as a test organism.  And then we looked at the zones of inhibition around each of the bacterial colonies that  were on there.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:11):**  And we could evaluate and come to what we call the antagonistic potential index, which  was a reflection of all the organisms.  We didn't know what they were, they could have been lots of the same organism, but the  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  antagonistic potential, and still potential, tested, but the potential to suppress pathogen  was greatly increased in the presence of mycorrhizae as opposed to the absence of mycorrhizae.  So it didn't make any difference, but these were all bacteria by the way.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  And that's one-sided in the sense that there could also be antagonistic fungi, which we  did not measure in those tests.  But let's just say there's trichodermas there too, and trichodermas can have the same kind  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:50):**  of effect.  Well if you did the same kind of an assay to measure the antagonistic potential against  the specific pathogen, this is the strain that's in that field, then it doesn't really  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  make any difference what the organisms are.  You can say that that pathogen will be suppressed by that population of organisms in the mycorrhizosphere.  It's really kind of a fundamental concept, but needs to be tested.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:15):**  And by the way, most laboratories, with only one exception that I know of, ever even tried  to measure antagonistic potential and put a number on it.  There used to be a lab in Southern California, BBC Labs, that used to do that.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  You send them your pathogen, they can look at the soil and find out what the antagonistic  potential is, whatever the treatment was in the soil.  Are there more antagonists against that pathogen than not?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:41):**  Well they give you a high, low, and medium number.  We actually try to actually count them.  And we did that based on the zone of inhibition around the bacterial colony once we oversprayed  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  with the pathogen.  You take Canadian, for example, sprayed over the whole plate, find out those bacterial  colonies that showed a zone of inhibition where the spores didn't germinate, you know  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:06):**  what I'm saying, a zone of inhibition.  And you can count all the population on that plate and the size of the zone of inhibition  and come up with the antagonist potential index.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:17):**  When we consider the implications of what you are describing and the capacity that Mike  or I have as a recruiting agent, in essence, we've known that they were a very important  foundational species to manage well, and this just emphasizes that to an even greater degree.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  And I think this should lead us to ask questions that you are perhaps uniquely qualified to  answer, which is what is the best way to inoculate and develop and maintain a mycorrhizal population?  There are lots of questions about tillage.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  Can I till my soils and how do I maintain a mycorrhizal population or redevelop it in  a tilled soil environment?  How do I establish a mycorrhizal population in an orchard system where the trees are 10  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:05):**  years old and I want to keep them for another 20 years or longer?  So I think there are lots of questions about how we manage mycorrhizae in some of these  different environments that there are many people who have the questions and few who  
**[0:44:16-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:16):**  seem to have good answers.  What are your thoughts?  Well, the first question that comes with any of the crops, do they already have mycorrhizae?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  I mean, tree crops that are growing or grapevines that are growing, if they don't have mycorrhizae  already, they're not growing.  Grapes can't survive without mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  So then the question is, do I have to add more and would it do any good if I added more?  Well, the answer to that could be probably not.  But the idea of establishing mycorrhizae when you transplant into that grapevine, into that,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  if they're already inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi, so they're already mycorrhizal to begin  with, that's the best you could hope for.  Inoculate at the time you transplant.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:58):**  If you can't inoculate the transplant, then when you transplant, at least put inoculum  in the soil, in the hole, where the roots are going to run into it right away.  That's really all you can do.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  You can't put it on the top of the soil and hope it's going to wash down.  Some of it will.  You can put some of it on seed because some of it will wash off the seed and get to the  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  roots, not as efficiently as bacteria would, like rhizobium.  You can put that on the seed.  But that's another way of delivering it.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  That's the kind of crop, you're not doing a transplant, you're doing the seeding.  If you're going to do seed, put it on the seed in high enough population, enough it  will wash down the root system, or put it right under the seed.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:41):**  That's the only advice that I can give to people as far as mycorrhizal fungi.  Then manage the kind of fertility that will favor the development of mycorrhizae.  Don't put a lot of phosphorus fertilizer on and suppress them.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  This leads me to two follow-up questions that we just described, which the first question  is if you have an established system and you ask the question, are they already colonized  the mycorrhizae?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  My question would be, how can we establish that?  How can we know that?  Are there laboratory assays that growers can use to identify that?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  Unfortunately, I don't know that many places that will do it, but yes, you can do it.  I do it all the time here.  You have to collect the feeder roots from that plant, whether it's grapes or beans  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  or whatever.  You clear and stain the roots and find out if they're colonized.  There are ways that the experimental people do this all the time.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  They actually quantify it.  We posted a paper a long time ago on quantifying mycorrhizae.  But a clearing and staining process allows you to detect the propagules of the mycorrhizal  
**[0:46:47-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:47):**  fungus or structures that indicate mycorrhizae in roots, like hyphae, like spores, that tell  you even to the point of saying no mycorrhizae, low mycorrhizae, medium, high, that would  give a grower an idea that in fact mycorrhizae are there and probably functioning.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  I can't even tell you what labs will do that.  I do know that people can quantify the population of spores in their commercial soils labs that  do that sort of thing.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  But that's just a number of spores.  If you ever had roots that were colonized, you clear and stain them and find out if you  see mycorrhizae.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  I say I do that in my lab all the time.  I mean not all the time, but if somebody asked.  If people put material on a product, on like a mycorrhizal product, anybody's product,  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  and they get effects, the question that comes in my mind immediately is did they actually  form mycorrhizae or was the effect due to something else?  Some of the products are actually laid with fertilizer, so they're actually getting a  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  fertilizer effect and they didn't actually form mycorrhizae.  Even when they see really striking results, what happened to the mycorrhizal population?  There are organic products, one that I can think of right now is called C-crop.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  They extract organic materials from ocean water and make a product called C-crop.  They put it on, they get growth effects.  Question is did they actually encourage mycorrhizal fungi or some other beneficial system, microbial  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  system?  They all claim that they probably do, but there's no evidence of it.  They could have that evidence, they just don't do it.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  I've actually volunteered for some of those people that have products like that to say  send me roots of the treated plants versus the control and I can tell you if there are  more mycorrhizae on the treated ones than the controls.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  Yeah, I imagine you haven't been taken up on that offer very often.  No, exactly right.  There were tests being done in South Carolina for example, I can't remember what the crop  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  was right now.  I can't think of it.  It was a legume actually.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  Did you actually with that product form more nodules that fix more nitrogen?  Yes or no?  More nodules or less nodules?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  What kind of nodules too?  If you've got more nodules when you use that product than if you didn't use that product,  then you have some information.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  You can say our product stimulates the formation of nodules of rhizobium on this, maybe it  was peanuts for example.  And then you get to the situation, you get more nodules formed of rhizobium in the presence  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  of specific strains of mycorrhizal fungi than if you don't have that strain of mycorrhizal  fungus.  A paper we published in 1993, not appreciated by most people, surely not the nitrogen fixing  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  people.  If you don't have that combination of mycorrhizal plus rhizobium, you don't get the full bang.  Something that we've observed many times is that when we apply inoculants of various types  
**[0:49:55-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:55):**  without mycorrhizal, we don't get the response that you do when you combine it with mycorrhizae.  The same thing would happen if you applied mycorrhizal fungi plus a plant growth promoting  rhizobacterium, PGPR.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:09):**  We published a paper that showed, one of the first papers that's almost never cited because  it was so early, in the presence of mycorrhizae and this pseudomonad, you actually had a change  in the nutritional composition in the plant as a result of the combination that you didn't  
**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:25):**  get if you were separate.  This reminds me of an experience that we had a couple of years ago with a, this was a spinach  crop in California being irrigated with various saline irrigation water.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:36):**  Very high sodium level, very high chloride levels.  It was in fact so high that the spinach crop was bitter and the leaf edges were burnt and  the crop was, I can't say that it was entirely unmarketable, but it was largely unmarketable  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  and yields were severely depressed because of the high sodium levels.  And we were working with this bacterial inoculant that has been known to somehow sequester or  lock up or tie up sodium levels.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  They no longer show up in the leaf tissue or in plant sap and they no longer show up  in the soil.  And we've gotten some very nice responses, but in this particular case, the sodium levels  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  were so high that even though the levels were dropping a little bit, we were not getting  the response that we had seen in other areas and the crop was still challenged and so forth.  Well, our consultant noticed that the one row of spinach right at the field edge was  
**[0:51:28-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  perfect.  It looked really awesome.  It didn't have any leaf burning effect from the high sodium levels.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  It was planted right beside a row of carrots in the neighboring field.  It was like 16 inch spacing between the rows fairly closely together and the carrots had  been inoculated with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  So we repeated our experiments on the spinach where we put on this inoculant again in the  bio stimulant combined with mycorrhizae.  And we went from getting very poor performance to getting very good performance.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  The sodium levels in the soil dropped dramatically.  The spinach crop performed exceptionally well.  We were able to produce full harvests for multiple cuttings after that and completely  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  turned the situation around.  And I find this particularly interesting because this is shifting a little bit now, I understand,  but when we had this experience, probably seven or eight years ago at this point, spinach  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:23):**  is considered to be a crop that is not associated with mycorrhizae.  And yet it still showed that pronounced positive response to the presence of mycorrhizae.  What are your thoughts about that?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  Well again, to the question, were there actually mycorrhizae that for whatever reason at this  point actually formed mycorrhizae with spinach?  If there weren't any mycorrhizae formed there, but they were present because they inoculated,  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:51):**  what did you inoculate with?  What kind of inoculant was there?  The inoculum mycorrhizal fungi can contain many other organisms, some of which were originally  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  associated with mycorrhizae when the pot culture was being grown.  So you may be adding some beneficial organisms just because they were there in the inoculum.  Now I've actually heard that kind of a story before and people say, well, I know I had  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  to say, well spinach doesn't form mycorrhizae so that wasn't what was going on.  It didn't form mycorrhizae, but you might have formed, and this is true in many, many  cases, the inoculants formed in a pot culture system can contain many of these associates  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  as the inoculum was being produced and they are also added, as you know, in our own product.  You're adding a lot of organisms plus the mycorrhizae.  If the spinach didn't form mycorrhizae, it also got a dose of all the other beneficial  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  organisms that were associated with mycorrhizae back in the previous stage.  There are other examples where, for example, tomato wilt.  This is an example in Japan.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:00):**  When they planted onions next to the tomato plants in a greenhouse situation where they  were growing greenhouse tomatoes, they didn't have fusarium wilt anymore.  What did the onion bring to the system to change the soil biology in such a way that  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  you didn't get wilt?  They actually created a suppressive soil situation there by adding onions in amongst the tomatoes.  You just changed the whole biology.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  There's also the business of what we call nurse crops.  You can actually form mycorrhizae on one plant and then have it be transferred from that  crop onto the corn plant, for example, in strip planting situations.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:44):**  It could be happening, but there's not much documentation of it.  I know what was happening in Colorado.  I actually suggested they do that, but they had strip tilled plant corn, but they had  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:54):**  rye before.  There was a potential that mycorrhizal fungus vegetatively moved through the soil, got onto  the corn roots earlier than otherwise, and you got an increase in yield because they  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  formed mycorrhizae early enough to show some benefit.  This raises an interesting question.  It's getting to be fairly well understood that if you want to have good mycorrhizal  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  colonization shortly after planting, then putting on soluble phosphorus fertilizers  in the fertilizer starter is probably a really bad idea.  The question that I've been asked occasionally when growers realize their mistake shortly  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  after the beginning of the season, they ask the question, can I inoculate mycorrhizae  when the plant is already six inches or eight inches tall in the case of the corn plant?  Is it possible if they've applied that soluble phosphorus fertilizer, how much does that  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  delay colonization?  Is it possible to re-inoculate later in the season and still have an effect on the crop  that they're able to get it down into the soil profile?  
**[0:55:57-0:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  Well, the potential is there for sure.  The question is, what happened to the phosphorus that they put on?  Did it get tied up?  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  The phosphorus-fixing capacity of the soil is really critical.  If it got tied up and was no longer in the soluble form, then adding inoculum later and  washing it down enough and the sores are large, they don't wash really readily.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  But if you could get it down in the root system, yes, there's potential to farm mycorrhizae  after the phosphorus is already tied up.  The soluble phosphorus that you put on, in your soils, I don't know what the phosphorus-fixing  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:30):**  capacity is, but in our areas out here, it gets tied up pretty fast.  In many agricultural soils that I have experience with, phosphorus applications are usually  tied up in some cases in days, but most often certainly in weeks and occasionally months.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  I was going to say, we've done that experiment and it was days.  Yes.  If most people realize how much money they waste on phosphorus applications, they would  
**[0:56:56-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  stop spending money pretty quickly because it's a complete waste, or largely a waste.  Yes, I don't know any examples of people that have actually tried to do that post-inoculation.  Because they realize they put too much phosphorus on.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  If it's in the soil situation, the phosphorus-fixing capacity is really a critical thing.  If you're in a potting mix, there's no phosphorus-fixing capacity in potting mixes.  It almost goes straight through.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  You'd stay in the pot.  That's another important point.  If these people are going to do transplants, then they could be inoculating with all kinds  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:32):**  of things onto the transplant so that they're preloaded when they go out into the field.  After we talked the other day, I got a paper that came to me on my computer.  It's not a new paper.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:44):**  It's 2018.  Here's the title.  Biocontrol measures against onion basil rot, this is a fusarium, onion basil rot incidents  
**[0:57:52-0:57:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:52):**  under natural field conditions.  They tried two species of trichoderma, one Pseudomonas and one Bacillus, and they got  much better control of the disease by inoculating the seedlings before they transplanted, by  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  dipping them in these suspensions, transplanting them, they got better disease than they get  with the chemical that they use to compare to.  That's the very concept we're talking about here.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  If you're going to do transplants or bulbs or whatever, cuttings, inoculate the transplant  before it goes into the field.  We actually published a paper.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  I keep referring to these papers and I'm sorry because they point to the idea that pre-inoculation  with mycorrhizal fungi is the most efficient way you can deliver the fungi to the plant  system and have it on there when it goes out into the field, whether it's grapes or it's  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  onions or it's whatever.  Draining doesn't really make any difference.  Pre-inoculation prevents transplant shock, whatever that amounts to, so you have more  
**[0:58:55-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  plants that survive.  Even under salty conditions, we have a paper on very high salt conditions and pre-inoculated  with mycorrhizal fungi, they tolerated the salt and they didn't if they didn't have mycorrhizae.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:07):**  Just the transplant shock itself, pre-inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi geraniums, transplant,  there's all kinds of things why you have transplant shock and the plants don't go very well if  you hadn't pre-inoculated.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  There's a paper published on that.  So all of this points to the idea of pre-inoculating transplants or a propagule, whatever it's  going to be, even seed, if that were efficient with the organism that you want, then that's  
**[0:59:34-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:34):**  what they ought to do.  I mean, back to the systemic approach, that would be the one common thing that they ought  to do.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  There's a whole business of seed priming.  Seed priming, I know you know this already.  You could do seed priming with things like polyethylene glycol that will change the osmotic  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  potential, but you could also do seed priming with antagonistic organisms.  And if you're worried about Pythium damping off right away, you can pre-inoculate the  seed and prevent that from happening because it happens within hours after the seed are  
**[1:00:09-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  transplanted.  So the seed starts to germinate, they became infected.  Pre-emergent damping off or post-emergent damping off, but you get protection by inoculating  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  the seed.  I don't know how many people do that.  I don't know how many people do seed priming, but the idea of doing it at the same time  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:25):**  you're doing seed priming against uniform seed germination is a good thing.  I almost never talk, I try to never talk about products in our interviews, in our podcast  interviews, but I think a lot of our listeners would appreciate knowing that the product  
**[1:00:42-1:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  that we've developed called BioCoat Gold uses Dr. Minderman's Microagricle Fungi.  And also a lot of these antagonistic organisms that we're speaking about.  So I've observed a lot of these effects in the field and I didn't expect to quite get  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  into this conversation when we started here, but I think it's important to just let everyone  know.  I know many of you have experienced the incredible effectiveness that this product can have on  
**[1:01:04-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:04):**  managing some of these diseases.  And these are some of the principles, interactions that are going on behind it.  So I think there's a key phrase that you mentioned, Bob, when you were speaking about the first  
**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:13):**  paper you mentioned a moment ago regarding the onion basil rot, you used the word effectiveness  as compared to a fungicide.  And we have adopted a model of agriculture today where for some reason we just expect  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:31):**  that fungicides or insecticides are the best tools that are out there.  They're the easy tools, they're the tools that we're familiar with.  And immediately in our mind, when we start thinking about biocontrols, they get compared  
**[1:01:45-1:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:45):**  against the fungicide.  How does a biocontrol compare against the fungicide?  Our own experience in the field has been that in many cases, not in all cases, but in the  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  great majority of cases, the biocontrols are actively more effective than the fungicides.  In fact, we just had an experience recently, the conversation we had a couple of days ago  regarding phytophthora and peppers where the chemical sales rep acknowledged directly to  
**[1:02:11-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:11):**  the grill room and said, the product that we are selling you to control phytophthora  doesn't work.  It's not effective.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  And yet it's what is being sold.  It's what we've come to expect as being effective to control a certain disease.  So I'd love to hear your professional perspective as a scientist who has looked at these things.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:28):**  What are typical effectiveness rates of biocontrols as compared to fungicides and products in  a jug?  Well, that's a big one.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  Well, that's a big one.  But you know, the strategy paper I referred to earlier, we have a quote in there that  I'm going to use to answer the question.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:47):**  This came from actually Jim Cook and Ken Baker.  Quote is, biological control is not inherently spectacular.  Its successes tend to be overlooked or attributed to other factors.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:00):**  And the spectacular responses that you could get from a chemical because it's going to  be short or sometimes short lived or it just don't occur, whereas the biological systems  eventually will give you the best outcome.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:15):**  But they're not spectacular because they don't happen instantly.  That's the instant gratification of using an insecticide or a fungicide.  If it works, you see results.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  You don't really necessarily see the results of biological systems until the end, into  the crop or later, like ash burners.  His trees recovered.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:37):**  Well, it didn't happen overnight as a whole system.  But his trees did recover as he developed healthy roots to support the tree.  The same thing could be happening in peppers, but you're talking about an annual crop.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:50):**  So you need to get started early in the system.  And chemicals, I mean, even fumigants don't necessarily get to all the places in the soil.  So if you drench with something like ritamol, you may not get it to where the propagals  
**[1:04:04-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  of the pathogen are.  So you may get the ineffectiveness for that, not to mention resistance to the pathogen  to that particular material, which is known.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:14):**  So I don't know how to compare because we don't have one on one.  I've got a field where I put biological control systems on versus I put chemicals on and say,  well, what's the percentage take?  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:25):**  In your blog, you've referred to a lot of the treatments that have gone on for years  and all.  We don't know what a real healthy looking plant even looks like anymore because yields  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:34):**  are down and the leaves are smaller and they don't look like they're performing very well.  As a result of long term applications of chemicals, whether it's herbicides or other chemicals,  that change the biology in such a way that you don't get the performance.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  The plant doesn't grow normally anymore or what it used to have, what it used to see,  you don't see anymore.  I'm really grateful to be alive in this day at this moment in time to be able to help  
**[1:05:02-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  bring about the change in how we grow food and how we manage our agriculture.  And at the same time, I also would have loved to be present to see some of the fields and  orchards that I see in old photos.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  I have, my father helped, worked on an orchard in his teens, it was probably 40 years ago  now, where they had old apple trees that were two and a half to three feet in diameter with  branches on the first layer of branches where the branches were 20 inches to two feet in  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  diameter and the trees were 40 feet in diameter altogether.  And they had no diseases.  They sprayed no fungicides.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:46):**  They sprayed no insecticides because they had these incredibly large robust root systems  and they had the entire system working.  So obviously that's not a system that is transferable today with our labor environment and everything  
**[1:05:57-1:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:57):**  else.  But I think there are still many things that we can learn from the way that crops were  grown in that era without any fungicide and insecticide applications.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:05):**  My father had a big garden too.  He wasn't a farmer, but he had a big garden and he never put fungicides on anything.  And he grew the best corn, the best strawberries.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  But I can remember going down to the docks with him where they load salmon heads on in  his trailer as he worked.  He worked for the post office.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  He got them home at night with a trailer load of fish heads.  We took the salmon cheeks out for dinner and the rest of it got buried under the strawberry  in rows and you wouldn't believe the strawberries he grew.  
**[1:06:34-1:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:34):**  He never put a fungicide on anything in his garden.  And that's the kind of thing that we kind of strive right now to get back to.  There are so many limitations that occur.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:46):**  I mean it's like organic matter.  You need to put more organic matter in your soil.  Well where do I get the organic matter?  
**[1:06:53-1:06:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:53):**  Well it's produced in three or four states over.  So there's a shipment cost.  Transporting these materials to where big farmers can put it on a field and the volumes  
**[1:07:04-1:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  that need to be there to do the good.  That's almost impossible.  This reminds me of an important topic that we haven't yet spoken about and that is  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:12):**  the potential to produce your own organic matter locally on your own fields.  I'm passionate about the potential of plants to increase their photosynthesis to much higher  levels and to sequester a lot more carbon simply as a result of having more efficient  
**[1:07:27-1:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:27):**  photosynthesis.  What is the impact of myorrhizal colonization on photosynthetic efficiency?  Well you had that on your list and I was glad you asked it because there is a paper from  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  if you look at it in the mycorrhizal literature, Gabe Bethlen-Pauvey was a scientist who worked  on mycorrhizae.  He was in California and transferred into my unit up here before he retired.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  They did work on increased photosynthesis with mycorrhizae compared to plants that didn't  have it.  There definitely is an increase in photosynthetic capacity with mycorrhizae compared to without.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:06):**  How that translates into the field situation, how many mycorrhizae, I don't have an answer  to that.  Early in our conversation you mentioned the possible food sources that could be used to  
**[1:08:17-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:17):**  enhance fungal microbial communities and you made mention of chitin as one possible food  source.  Actually, my thoughts go in two different directions.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  One is what is the potential of using chitin as a food source to develop mycorrhizal and  other fungal populations and kind of related to that, as soon as I started asking that  question another question popped into my mind.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:41):**  We also haven't spoken about the impact of mycorrhizae on nematode control which I think  is kind of connected to that.  Well there is good literature on nematode control in the presence of mycorrhizal nematode  
**[1:08:53-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:53):**  populations or activity is definitely decreased.  So there is a lot of evidence of that.  As far as adding chitin to support specific groups of organisms, they do support actinomycetes  
**[1:09:08-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  if you add chitin but I don't know anything about the mycorrhizal part of it.  The only study that has actually been done where you say add chitin and you get more  mycorrhizae.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:18):**  It is something that could be done but I just don't think that it has been done specifically.  It gets back to if you added chitin and you get certain responses.  I have a colleague here that just asked me that question the other day.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:33):**  We added chitin, some other people did an experiment up in Oregon here where they added  crab shell and crab shell is being added into some premix kind of things.  I saw the examples in that experiment where roots were actually stimulated by the presence  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:51):**  of crab shell in the medium.  What caused that is really not known.  Did we change the population of anything microbiologically other than chitinase producing actinomycetes?  
**[1:10:08-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  I don't know anybody that knows the answer to that and I don't know about for mycorrhizal  fungi.  If you added chitin do you get more mycorrhizae?  
**[1:10:14-1:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  I don't know the answer to that.  But again if you did that experiment that is one more step to take and you would have  the answer.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:23):**  Take the roots of the plants that are treated versus the ones that aren't treated and clear  and stain them and find out what the level of mycorrhizae is.  It is rather simple.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:33):**  It is not done.  Not usually done.  I have reviewed a lot of papers where I say did you actually look at mycorrhizae on your  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  roots?  Well no we didn't look.  Well you can talk about the effects of mycorrhizae but can you really attribute that to mycorrhizae  
**[1:10:50-1:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:50):**  and or their associates?  This all happens when it doesn't happen with mycorrhizae by itself most often.  It is a team effort which is the whole mycorrhizosphere concept.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:00):**  So let's expand a little bit on nematode treatment.  Does mycorrhizal association and the whole teamwork that comes with mycorrhizal association  provide enough nematode control that it can be an effective treatment for root knot nematodes  
**[1:11:16-1:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:16):**  and other similar nematodes?  I believe it could.  I actually couldn't tell you that it has been done and I have to think back to some papers  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:25):**  on nematode suppression.  Basically have looked at even the products that were out there that were heightened based,  looked at changes in behavior of the nematodes that are fewer eggs laid heightened in the  
**[1:11:43-1:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:43):**  surface of eggs.  All the effects were on the nematode per se without knowing whether there were other associated  organisms that were with the mycorrhizal fungi that actually did those sorts of things.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:55):**  There are people in Riverside, California that are looking at bacteria that are nematode  suppressing in various ways.  What they don't include in their systems are where the mycorrhizal is present.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  They just looked at one part of it but they may have associated their added organism with  mycorrhizal fungi and it was a team effort.  They don't ever look at the other part of the team.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  I have not been to meetings out here for the years.  I am not going to so many meetings anymore but people in Riverside have done some really  good work on, I can't even tell you which bacteria they are using, but they find some  
**[1:12:36-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:36):**  that are suppressive to nematodes.  When they say suppressive to nematodes that may mean the reproductive capacity is influenced,  fewer eggs laid, fewer eggs hatched, fewer first stage nematodes.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  Those are the kinds of things that were majored in a plant with mycorrhizal versus ones that  didn't have mycorrhizae.  But if they are looking at the bacterial part of it, looking for antagonistic bacteria against  
**[1:13:05-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:05):**  nematodes, they leave out the mycorrhizal part of it.  So you don't know if they are involved or not.  Or if they help the bacteria that they added do its job, they may have teamed up.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:17):**  Bob, you have shared lots of wisdom and knowledge that you have gained over the years.  I am sure there are many conversations more that we could have like this.  But there is one important question that I want to get to.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  What is something that you wish all farmers knew?  You put that on your list and I thought about it a lot.  I would like farmers to know that biological options are available.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  That they should consider biological things at least equally and maybe preferentially  over chemical treatments.  And until farmers begin to ask the kind of questions that you are asking and you are  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:01):**  asking sort of for them, we are not going to get those kinds of answers.  That kind of means that there have to be more people to step up and try to get the answers  to those questions.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  And unfortunately those people are few and far between.  We have actually done away in the U.S. with mycorrhizae people.  They don't exist anymore.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:25):**  The USDA at one time I had a meeting of all the mycorrhizae people of the ARS in the country.  We all got together and talked.  Most of those people are retired or were closed out.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:39):**  They don't do mycorrhizae stuff anymore.  And that is unfortunate because I would like to see the biological control approach favored  as opposed to chemical approaches.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:53):**  And it's shifting that way but it's taking a while.  I mean there are more products that are out there right now but the products are out there  simply from a market point of view.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  They find these organisms sometimes based on really flimsy evidence and not real field  evidence.  And the erythropytridish assay, which I do too.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:11):**  I see these organisms all the time.  I isolate the bacteria.  I try to put them on and test against the pathogens that I'm working with specifically.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:21):**  Even their pathogens in the nursery, things like cylindracladium, rhizoctonia, phytophthors,  Pythiums.  By the way, Pythium antagonists are really hard to come by.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:32):**  I rarely find a product that really works against the Pythium isolates that I have.  And it's because Pythiums are so fast, Rhizoctonias are so fast.  And both of those organisms by the way grow vegetatively through soil.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:48):**  So it's really hard to find organisms that will slow them down.  I keep looking for them but I haven't found a lot yet.  So that's I guess the answer to my question.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:01):**  I'd like farmers to consider biological systems.  Bob, what is a topic that you would like to speak about more often to growers but you  don't because you sense they may not be ready to consider it?  
**[1:16:16-1:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:16):**  What topics?  Well again I'm trying to answer the same question.  I don't think most of the discussions that are going on right now don't have enough  
**[1:16:28-1:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:28):**  to do with biological systems.  I mean you're an exception in that you bring the subject up in everything that you do.  You can go back to all kinds of questions about cover crops and organic amendments and  
**[1:16:43-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:43):**  biological products that are added.  Again it gets down to if they aren't as spectacular or the potential results are  not so spectacular that their farmers are not likely to go there, I'd like them to  
**[1:16:59-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  be more tenacious than that and stay with it until they figure it out.  I gave a talk one time on learning from all the mistakes I've made.  I did this experiment.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:11):**  Why didn't it work?  What went wrong?  You learned a lot from your mistake.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  Why didn't it work?  Why didn't mycorrhizal form on my onions?  Well it's because you did such and such.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  You put it in a gandhi spreader and spread it all over the field but not put it where  it needed to be.  Or you did it too late.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  But if you analyze all the mistakes that people make, if they made mistakes, I tried that  but it didn't work, why didn't it work?  How can we change the approach so that it would work?  
**[1:17:45-1:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:45):**  And your system, you have all kinds of consultants and farm advisors and things that are out  there and the farmers are seeing those people some but more than likely the people that  they see the most are chemical salesmen.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  That's kind of sad in a way but it's probably true.  You can confirm that.  I'm not going to be wrong about that but that's been my experience that growers out here,  
**[1:18:12-1:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:12):**  they see chemical salesmen coming around with a product more often than they see of somebody  coming around selling a biological.  It's still the mainstream, that's for sure.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:23):**  Bob, I want to say thank you for sharing all of your knowledge and wisdom and the insights  that you have experienced and I look forward to having more conversations like this in  the future.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  I would be happy to do that John, really I would.  I'd like to talk about this stuff but I'd also like a vehicle to communicate if it is  to growers that need it.

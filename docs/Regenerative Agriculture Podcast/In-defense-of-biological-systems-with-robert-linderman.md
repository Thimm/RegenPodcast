### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 17:18:55)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we talk about agronomic  
**[0:00:06-0:00:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:06):**  science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil health,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:12):**  and ultimately also regenerate public health.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:16):**  Today I have a guest on the podcast that I've been wanting to have for some time.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  When I was introduced to him the first time or told about him the first time, I was told  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  that this individual is the senior grandfather of mycorrhizal fungi research and developing  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  these suppressive soils and that very few people, fewer people know about him and deserve  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  to know about him.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:40):**  So today I'm excited to have Dr. Robert Linderman from the USDA here from Corvallis, Oregon.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  Bob, thank you very much for agreeing to be here and sharing some of your knowledge and  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  wisdom.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  I'd love to hear more about your story and background.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  How did you come to do all the research that you've done in developing disease suppressive  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:00):**  soils and with mycorrhizal fungi associations?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  Tell us a little bit about your story and your background and how you came to this spot.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Well thank you very much John, I appreciate the opportunity.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  My history goes back a long ways as you already know.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  I started out as a zoologist, a pre-med student.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  I went to Fresno State College and became interested in plants actually along the way.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  Went to graduate school, eventually went to graduate school at UC Berkeley and worked  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  with some world renowned people on diseases and pathogens.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  In 1967 I graduated from there and went to the USDA ARS Research Facility in Beltsville,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:42):**  Maryland.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  There were people there that I got to know but one of them happened to be a person interested  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  in mycorrhizal fungi and I got to thinking about mycorrhizal fungi in a broader context  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  and kind of became a student of that at that time.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  But then I was transferred to Corvallis, Oregon where there were other world renowned researchers  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  working on mycorrhizal fungi and I was still a student of that subject.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:09):**  And it just kind of went from there.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  I began to study it and say well this is one of the most important components of the rhizosphere  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  of plants that would affect plant diseases, especially root diseases.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:22):**  And it kind of went from there.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  I began to study all the interactions that occur in that zone next to the roots and became  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  interested in the concept of the potential of biological control to control those pathogens  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  in that zone right next to the roots.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  So the rest of my career kind of related to that and I addressed specific pathogens on  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  nursery crops but always had the idea that some of those pathogens could be controlled  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  rather than with chemicals they could be controlled with biological systems.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  It's a matter of how to develop and find the systems and make them work.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  And that's been kind of a struggle ever since.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  There's a certain reluctance to consider the concept of biological control by many growers  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  because they already have their systems kind of worked out and they kind of know and then  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  there's a lot of chemicals that people can sell them that would address certain diseases.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  And so they kind of pushed aside the idea of biological control.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  Well that's all changing in current times because there's a lot more concern about chemicals  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  being used from both a standpoint of human health as well as damage and impact on the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  environment.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:42):**  So there are a lot of companies that have kind of shifted a little bit into biological  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  control developing products and there are a lot of biological control products out there.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  I think the real problem is those people that might want to consider biological control  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  really don't know how to get started.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  And the key is in my opinion is not to necessarily try to change the whole biology of the soil  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  but to change the biology of the soil right next to the roots and on the roots.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  So that means prevent the disease before it ever happens.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:14):**  And that's kind of the thrust of everything that I am thinking now and things that I've  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  done.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  And that includes mycorrhizal fungi and the organisms that associate with them in sort  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  of a team effort to potentially suppress pathogens and enhance plant growth and health.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  That's kind of where I am right now.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  I retired from the USDA in 2007 so I've been retired for almost 13 years.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  I'm a private consultant right now with nurseries working on these various things that we're  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  talking about trying to have the nursery people be able to control diseases that they get.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:50):**  And as we talked the other day, the potential for field crops where transplants are being  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  used is still part of the nursery industry.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:00):**  We could manage those populations on the roots of plants in the nursery before they ever  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  go to the field.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  And that's kind of a concept that we could explore further.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:10):**  And I'll stop talking there and maybe we can go to some questions that you have.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  Well there's no shortage of questions that I have for you, that's for sure.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  So just some of the things that you've mentioned in your quick introduction, a number of pieces  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  that you brought up that I want to dive a bit deeper on.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:30):**  But let's perhaps start with the question of if you are a commercial grower and you  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  have a desire to develop disease suppressive soils and to manage some of the pathogens  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:40):**  that you have challenges with a given crop, how do you begin?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  Where's the start?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  Where's the starting point?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  And how can you, there's also a lot of questions about the broad range of biocontrol products  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  that are available which are effective, which are not effective.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  We know it's very context dependent.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  So how do you make the decisions about what to choose and where do you begin?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  Well let's just say you're a grower with some specific disease problem.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  You have to consider the products that are out there available to you right now that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  would address those pathogens, that specific disease.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  I'll just look at your list and think of some of the kinds of things like, I'll just say  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  Fusarium or let's go to Rhizoctonia.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  How could you control Rhizoctonia?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:19):**  You have to ask the question how and when does Rhizoctonia get in because of the disease?  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  Is it present in the field soil that you're going to plant into?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  And if so, it would be a good idea to be able to take a product where the label says this  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  organism or series of organisms works to control Rhizoctonia and then as a matter of delivering  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  that product to the site where it needs to be to work in a timely way.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  That is before the pathogen ever gets to the root.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:50):**  So that means pre-inoculation, that means inoculating transplants or inoculating an  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  onion bulb so that there's already a population, it's like immunizing the plant before it ever  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  gets exposed to the pathogen.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  So any grower can then look at the label and sometimes the labels are going to be maybe  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  inclusive of the pathogen that you're considering and that doesn't necessarily mean that it's  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  going to work on the strain of the pathogen that you are faced with in your soil.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  So there's that kind of specificity that can be a problem.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  So the real way to test that and there are not many people doing this kind of thing would  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  be to isolate the pathogen that you have in your field and test it against the product  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  that you're going to be using.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  You can do that in a Petri-Deuce test or you can develop some other kind of a plant bioassay  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  that simulates what would happen in the field.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  I'll take an example.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  There's a product called Triathlon.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  The label says it will work against Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Phytophthora, and Pythium, about  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  five different pathogens.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  Question would be whether or not that product has enough of whatever works against Rhizoctonia  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  to actually do the job.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:04):**  If you load the plant system up in advance of being exposed to the Rhizoctonia, then  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:10):**  you have the best chance of succeeding.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  That's where most growers are not quite in tune to the timing of the whole thing and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  where to put the material and when.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  Sometimes it doesn't do any good to add the product to a big volume because the population  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  doesn't maintain itself in the right place at the right time to do the suppression of  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  the pathogen.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  So the grower needs to consider all those kinds of things when developing a product.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  Maybe there is no product that controls the pathogen that you're concerned with.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  For example, I'm not really sure.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  Macrophomina is a pathogen that causes charcoal rot.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  Are there products out there already that would be addressing that pathogen?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  I can't answer that.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  I could look it up, but I don't really know the answer right now.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:56):**  But let's say there isn't one.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  There are ways, and this is back to the paper I mentioned earlier to you John about strategies  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  for finding and characterizing biocontrol agents.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  You could go to the field and look for examples where somehow the pathogen didn't do its job  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  and there's escapes.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  You may be able to isolate a pathogen and its antagonist from that field and then develop  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:22):**  that.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  Well, somebody has to do that commercially in order for you to do it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  The farmer is not going to be able to do it themselves.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  That ends up being a problem and that's kind of where we are right now.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:31):**  We may not have the specifics that are needed for that particular strain of the pathogen  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  in that specific field.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:37):**  That point, that's where some farmers will say it's too complicated, it's too much trouble,  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  and I don't have anybody to go to to help find that organism and develop it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  And so they go to chemicals as the best choice they have or some product that they might  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  try to see if it works.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  Bob, you hinted that timing of product application is really important and that my understanding  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  is that it needs to be applied before the potential pathogen actually produces an infection.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  Is it necessary always to apply materials at planting or even before planting in order  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  to produce the control effect that we're looking for?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  Well for sure and there are really good examples of why this is really essential but in almost  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:21):**  every case that I can think of to get the protection there before the pathogen gets  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  there should be the best thing no matter what.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  The question is, depending how the farmer farms and whether they're seeding or transplanting  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  or planting bulbs or whatever, to treat that material where the infection is going to happen  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:42):**  to have something there waiting for the pathogen when it tries to get into the plant is the  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  best chance.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  It's like immunizing a child for infections that might come.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  You build up some kind of resistance and the resistance is in biological form.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  If you wait until the pathogen already has started it's pretty hard to chase it down.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:03):**  It's like closing the gate after the cows are out.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:06):**  It's just a hard thing to do and maybe totally successful.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  And that's in fact the outcome for many people.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  I tried that material but it didn't work.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:16):**  Well when did you put it on?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  Or where did you put it?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  I can give you an example of the mycorrhizal fungi for example.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:21):**  Did you put it on the root system or where the roots would run into it?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:24):**  No.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  I put the fungus in a Ganyu spreader and spread it over the field on the top.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  Well it needed to be down where the roots were so if you failed that's good reason for  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  it.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  You didn't put it where it needed to be in a timely way.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:40):**  And the same would be true with any biocontrol agents.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  And of course there are ways of building up and this is a point to make too.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  Almost all soils have some antagonistic organisms to most pathogens.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:54):**  They're just there in too low a population to do what they need to do in a timely and  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:58):**  effective way.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  But if you can find them, build them up to a higher population so they dominate the site  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  that infections are going to occur in, then you have a good chance.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  The disease called crown gall is a bacterium.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  You must use the biocontrol agent to protect the wounds that that pathogen gets in.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  That's the normal way it gets in.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:18):**  And if you don't protect the wounds, then you get crown gall.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:23):**  It's as simple as that.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  And so you just have to find the organism, put it in the right place at the right time  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:30):**  to prevent the disease.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  The key for me in all of these things is prevention.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  Prevent the disease before it ever happens and that's the same concept with immunization.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  We prevent the disease from occurring.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  Bob, so far we've been having this conversation in the context or in framing it around the  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  use of commercial products, which are valuable and necessary tools and more of them are being  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  developed and going through the registration process all the time.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:58):**  What are the cultural management strategies and cultural management practices that growers  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  can use to enhance the development of disease suppressive organisms in their soil profiles  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  and shift their soil profile from one that favors the expression of pathogens to one  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  that suppresses it?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  Well, there are certain substrates that you can add to soil that will at least increase  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:22):**  the biological diversity.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  Assuming that the biology is soil, there are some components that are there that could  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  be effective in the biocontrol process.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  If you build them up in population, you put some organic matter, for example, in the soil  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  or chitin in the soil, you build up specific organisms that like that substrate, like the  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  actinomycetes like chitin because they can produce an enzyme that breaks it down.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  So that population of organisms will build up specifically or preferentially on a chitin  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:56):**  substrate.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  Other organisms don't like chitin so much, they aren't going to build up very much.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  So you can kind of shift the population in your favor in that particular case.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  But adding organic matter in general will increase the microbial diversity of the soil.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  And there will be a greater population of organisms that could suppress the pathogen,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:17):**  but they're also there competing with everything else that like that substrate, that compost,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:24):**  organic matter.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  And so it's difficult to favor the biocontrol agents that you want with a general amendment  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  like that.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  And you can kind of get to the idea that if you have a greater diversity, and then you  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:38):**  have some selective pressure that allows those organisms that you want to be recruited from  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  the population and given preferential treatment, then you've shifted the population in favor  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:51):**  of the organisms that you want.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  And one of the things that does this, and you've read the paper I sent you on the mycorrhizosphere,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  said, when you have mycorrhiza on a plant, they help recruit antagonistic organisms from  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  the background soil so that the population of antagonists in the presence of mycorrhiza  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  is greater than if you don't have mycorrhizae.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:14):**  So that's one way of preferentially shifting the population to something that you want,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  a team of organisms that some of which are antagonistic to a range of pathogens.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  And what builds up against one pathogen is not necessarily the ones that build up against  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  another pathogen.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  But the concept of mycorrhiza association stimulating antagonistic organisms in general,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:40):**  thereby increasing the antagonistic potential against a range of path, soilborne pathogens  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  is very good.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:49):**  We have growers that we're working with for producing very high value crops.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:53):**  And as fumigation becomes less and less of a viable commercial option, many people are  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  asking the question, what is the fastest route that we can take?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  There's no holds barred.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  Budget is not a limitation.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  We're willing to do whatever it takes to develop soil that can suppress these organisms.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  What's the pathway that you would advise them to use?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:15):**  What's the combination of cultural management practices and products that they should use  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  to achieve the optimal results?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  And we can use cesarean in soils as an example or cesarean in strawberries or macrophomina.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  I'm not working specifically with those, but I think you have to, even if you were  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  to choose a biological product and you add that in a system where there's a population  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  potential to be built up by some organic substrate, that is you could add organisms and favor  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:48):**  them by having some food material there to build up a population of them in advance of  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:54):**  planting.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  That would be the key.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  And of course the other thing, you and I have talked before about, and you've written  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  a lot about, improving soil health.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  That's one way you can increase the microbial diversity and therefore the soil health.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  But if you wanted to really increase the population next to the root system where the pathogen  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  is about to invade, then you probably need to inoculate the profit of the plant or put  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  the organism right where the roots of that plant will come in contact with it very quickly.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  That could be a drench of organisms, some product for example, right into the system  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  where the plant is going to have to grow, where the roots will develop.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:39):**  And if they get associated with the root system, wherever the root system goes, the organisms  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  will follow it.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  They'll stay with it unless you do something that's pretty drastic.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  And sometimes those treatments are drastic.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  They may also be trying for biological control but didn't give up on that or decide to  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  add some chemicals that may put the whole system on hold or suppress it.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  I'm not sure I got to the right answer there, what you were specifically asking.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  You have told me a lot in your blog about the fertility and the kinds of changes that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  would occur with different kinds of fertility.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  And there are surely examples where that kind of approach has shifted the population in  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:26):**  such a way that antagonists are favored.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  Here's an example on wheat take-all for example, here in Oregon, a palisade many years ago  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  found out that potassium chloride could be added and shift the population toward antagonistic  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  pseudomonads.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:42):**  There are other people that have done the same kind of thing with seed meals and things  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:46):**  like that.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  And you increase the antagonistic population, then you get less disease.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  That will be happening specifically with macrophomina and strawberries or any other crop.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  I'm not even sure I know the answer to that, but there could be certain cover crops that  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  might favor the buildup of antagonists.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  And you need to be able to measure the change in antagonistic potential as a result of whatever  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  you did, whether it was plant a different cover crop.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  There are examples where certain crops favor the buildup of antagonists against the pathogen  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  that was going to occur on the next plant.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  Those kinds of things are probably known, but not necessarily known by the farmers that  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  are going to try to practice it unless their fathers or grandfathers told them this is  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  the right way to do it.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  Surely many of those stories out there.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:45):**  There are so many of those stories out there, and this is exactly the type of conversation  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  I've been hoping to have with people and to draw out because the story, the example you  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  just shared of using potassium chloride to increase the antagonists for take-all disease  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  in wheat.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  There are so many cultural management practices that are known collectively by people in agriculture  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  and horticulture to how to control a specific disease organism in a specific context.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  But with cultural management practices, I would consider this a cultural management  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  practice, using tools, using specific forms of nutrients and specific types of products  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:27):**  to shift the soil microbial profile is knowledge that is out there, but it's not common knowledge.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  It's become, well vested interests, I believe, have, and just human nature, it's been easy  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  to just buy a product and a jug and then a fungicide or something like that and go fix  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  the problem.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  In reality, we have the collective knowledge amongst us to prevent a lot of these problems  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  from showing up in the first place, if only it were more widely known.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  Well, all these things are kind of specific examples, and so it's really difficult to  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  find one common denominator that would apply to many systems, that is, what cover crop  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  would build up antagonists to a specific pathogen, whatever the problem is.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:12):**  You mentioned the other day a phytophthora problem on peppers, I guess it was.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  You have to know what the strain of the pathogen is and what that field soil history is, and  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  I don't think there's anybody who collected all the information on any specific crop as  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  to what cover crop should be used to prevent such and such a disease.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  It's known in some cases, but not a lot.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  And frankly, the emphasis by research people and farmers and agronomists, horticulturists,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  has not been to find those organisms and develop that strategy or that protocol for growing  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  your crop.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  Unfortunately, I think the information could be there, but it's buried a little bit in  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:55):**  all kinds of literature or no literature.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  I can tell you the potassium chloride story, for example, on take-all was not published  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  in a Refereed Journal paper.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  Something was either in abstract or some local thing, and I happened to hear about it, because  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  I knew Bob Powelson.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  But those kinds of things are buried in the literature, and that's a really unfortunate  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  kind of thing in my own case, too.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:20):**  I've published papers that are buried in Refereed Journals, but the farmer never sees them.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  How do you get that material translated and put into a language that somebody can read  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:30):**  easily and say, this is how I'm going to approach it, or talk to somebody who will guide them  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  through that?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  And I'm not sure there are that many people out there that would be in that category.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  What are some examples of some of the papers that you've written and that you think farmers  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  would really value knowing about but that aren't widely known?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:49):**  That's a hard question, because I kind of know what the papers are.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  I went through a process fairly recently, since I'd worked on using onions as a test  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  organism for mycorrhizal fungi for many papers.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  I decided those papers were all buried in the scientific literature, and maybe I should  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  collect them and summarize some of those papers and put it in the journal called Onion World,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  where the farmers would actually read it, hopefully.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  Well, I published that paper, and it went into Onion World, but then I have no idea  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  whether the onion growers actually read it.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  And I know that this is where you might have come from, too, because you were involved  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  in this process we're going through right now, plus your blog, to try and translate  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  and transmit some of that information to growers who need it right now.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  They need to have it translated.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  They need to have it put into perspective that they can understand and try to apply.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  And I don't think there's a lot of that kind of thing.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  There's not enough of that happening.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  Well, it certainly, there's many days for me when it appears to be an almost overwhelming  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  task, because when you start getting into some of these papers, I become extremely excited  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  by the implications of connecting the dots, what a piece of research or a certain paper  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  means when we connect it to the rest of the knowledge base that is out there.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  So then you start following the bibliography, and all of a sudden you discover that this  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:27):**  paper cites an additional 100 other papers, of which 20 appear to be really exceptional.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  And it's just an ever-expanding list with no end.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  Well, I'm hearing what you say, and I totally agree.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:41):**  And you asked earlier what paper, even ones that I've published, that I could point to  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  that might be something that would tease growers into thinking about biological control systems.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  And the paper I just mentioned on strategies for detecting and characterizing biocontrol  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  systems for soil-borne pathogens is probably one that would maybe get growers, if they  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:08):**  were at that paper, to look down there and say, oh, here's an example.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  I've got crowndall, or I've got take-all, or I've got root rot of beans.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  And there's some grower, people that we referred to in that paper, that did such and such.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  They grew certain crops before beans.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  Well, I've never done that, so maybe that's something to try.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  But it gets them thinking about how they can figure out what parts and what strategy they  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  need to use for their specific crop.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:40):**  And of course, there are farmers that grow different crops.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:43):**  I mean, in your area, a lot of corn and soybeans are grown, but there are also all kinds of  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:49):**  vegetable crops and pumpkins and on and on.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  Then you have to consider the specifics of the pathogen.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:58):**  And that's where a lot of people will get off, because they're talking to agronomists  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  and horticulturists, maybe, and not necessarily working with a pathologist that can deliver  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  some specifics about the pathogen and what they need to consider.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:14):**  There are pathologists that are out there in your areas that, oh, Don Huber's a really  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  good example of somebody who knows those crops and knows those systems.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:22):**  You have to talk to them, but there's a few Don Hubers out there.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:26):**  I want to say that there are very few people who take a systemic approach.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  And I'm coming to realize that there are many people, actually, who do take a very systemic  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  approach to trying to understand these problems.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  But they are still in the great minority, it's still very easy.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:40):**  One of the challenges of the scientific method being brought into agriculture has been the  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:47):**  easy method of doing research is to attempt to do single factor analysis, identify a specific  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:53):**  factor, change it, and observe what happens.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  And of course, agricultural ecosystems are extraordinarily multifactorial.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:01):**  There's so many different factors that all work together and collaborate in these systems,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:05):**  things that we don't even fully understand yet.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  And within that context, our conversation, to some degree, we've been talking a little  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:14):**  bit about systems, we've been talking about cultural management practices and products  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  and so forth.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  But I'd love to hear a specific example.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  Let's say we're dealing with phytophthora issues on a specific crop.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  What are all the different tools or combinations of tools that you could bring into a system  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  to all try to have an influence on phytophthora?  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  We can supply specific products, we can grow cover crops in advance of the crop.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  What are some other things that we can do?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  And also, parallel to that question is, are there combinations of products that we should  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  consider trying, fomalinoculants combined with bacterial inoculants combined with biocinulants  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  and so forth?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:51):**  What is this a true systemic approach to solving the issue rather than just taking a single  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:55):**  factor point and shoot approach?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  Let me point you to that paper we're talking about on strategies and refer you to the system  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  called the Ashburner system in Australia.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:05):**  Phytophthora run rot on avocados.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:09):**  Ashburner was a farmer who knew he had phytophthora and his neighbors had phytophthora.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  Right next to his fields were the rainforest areas and the phytophthora was there but it  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  didn't cause any disease.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:24):**  What was different about those two systems?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  Ashburner decided that he was going to bring that system into his orchard.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  So he started growing a cover crop of material called lab lab and he didn't just chop it  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:38):**  up and work it into the soil.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  He chopped it and laid it over and built up a thick layer around his trees.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  He added lime.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:48):**  The system is described in that paper by the way.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  That's what I'm saying.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  And Ashburner basically brought his trees back into production by that whole system.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  He didn't understand or know all the other components.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  He didn't know anything about mycorrhizal fungi which could have been involved.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  But the suppressive soils, he created suppressive soils and the suppressiveness had to do with  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  organisms that would suppress the development of zoospores of the pathogen.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  If the pathogen doesn't develop zoospores that swim to the roots and infect it then  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  you don't get root infection.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:21):**  Pretty soon you have enough roots that are healthy and being protected to sustain tree  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  and those trees came back to production and he went on his merry way.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  He did that whole system from that point on.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  There are other people that have examples that we've heard of in that paper where  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  they've done this for years and years and they don't have bean root rot for example  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  or they don't have crown gall.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  In each case, you mentioned phytophthora on pepper.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  That would have to be done to build up the antagonistic potential of that field over  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:56):**  time.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  That could be a real problem because the grower may grow peppers one year and decide, well  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:03):**  okay I had a lot of disease I'm not going to grow peppers there anymore.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  So it's not like you have a sustained build up like you would with take all decline, something  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  systemic.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:12):**  And when you get down to the whole thing with a few exceptions, most all the plants on the  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  earth form mycorrhizae.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  Mycorrhizal fungi for me have become the key component and we still don't have people  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi even though they may be the orchestrator of really good  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  things to come including building up antagonistic potential.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  Not only mentioning the increase in uptake of phosphorus and other nutrients, those kinds  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  of things are what people talk about but there's a whole shift in the biology of a plant internally  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:49):**  and externally if you have mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  That includes building up antagonists, nitrogen fixtures, but not many people are studying  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  it.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  So we don't really know all the things that could be happening as a result of forming  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  mycorrhizae and you have to do it early.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:07):**  It's again the same with the protection against pathogens.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  You have to get it there before or as early as you can and that means how and when I can  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:15):**  apply the organism or that product to get mycorrhizal established as early as possible  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  to therefore benefit thereafter.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:24):**  We just don't have enough products and people doing that.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:29):**  You could be inoculating and this is back to what do you inoculate?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  Well in my case I can inoculate cuttings.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  I want to sanitize the cuttings and then inoculate them with beneficial organisms like antagonistic  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  organisms just to prevent against specific disease.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  But if you were to take the whole package, mycorrhizal fungus plus all the associated  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  organisms some of which, many of which might be antagonistic to pathogens, that would be  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:57):**  a good approach, a good systemic approach.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  But it's an expense and many growers are probably looking at that expense and saying well I  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  don't know if that's going to be worth it or not.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  So they almost talk themselves out of trying it.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  You know what I find interesting about the comment that you just made is this last week  
**[0:32:19-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  I was at an event in Iowa and corn growers have lost my desire to, I enjoy working with  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  corn less than I do with other crops, I'll just state that in a very kind way because  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  of the agronomic approach that it's commonly taking.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  What I found so intriguing is that growers have become so locked into a system.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:40):**  They know that they're going to lose money when they plant corn seeds in the ground.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  They know that's a foregone conclusion and yet they, the week that I was there they were  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:52):**  considering planting the following week to go out and put on a $40 an acre fungicide  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  application that is completely unwarranted.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  There is no need for it.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:02):**  There are no pathogens present.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  There is no disease present and there's none in the forecast particularly.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  But the only reason they're putting it on is because they've been told they need it  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  so that they don't lose any more money than they're already losing.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:16):**  And so I find that approach, that way of thinking about product applications, what if we were  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  to think about our biological products that way?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:26):**  What if we were to think about its mycorrhizal fungi and I can't afford not to put these  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  on otherwise I might lose more money than I'm already losing.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  Anyway that was just kind of a twisted reality.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  Made me think that I might have gone through the looking glass so to speak and have been  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:42):**  in a very different world.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  And then also before we go on to other topics I wanted to, for all of our listeners, I'll  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  be sharing the paper that Bob has referenced a couple of times.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  I've read it several times over the years and I'm really fascinated by the ash burner  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  example that is described in this paper because the way that it's defined and described is  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  quite interesting in the paper is described as developing a mulch layer on the soil surface  
**[0:34:13-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:13):**  to foster the development of microbial communities and also to supply abundant calcium and then  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  a very key phrase to supply all the nitrogen in the form of ammonium.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  That to me means the presence of a reducing environment in the soil profile not an oxidizing  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:30):**  environment.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  It's all part of the system.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:34):**  It's all part of the system.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  I'm not sure how Ashburner thought that through and developed the system.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  Actually Ken Baker who was one of the co-authors on the paper, he was one of my professors  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  at Berkeley, he actually knew Ashburner and had been to Mount Tambourine and seen the  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  system.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:51):**  And by the way I have had slides, aerial slides over his farm that show his farm next to the  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:59):**  neighbor's farms and his trees were growing and theirs weren't and other aspects of that.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  There were certain things that Ashburner didn't know anything about.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  For example in that layer that he built up as a mulch he developed humic materials near  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  the surface.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:14):**  The most decomposed there were more human materials there.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  Well what's the role of human materials in the whole process in terms of nutrients and  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  in terms of organisms and the whole thing?  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  What was the mycorrhizal status of the avocado trees?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  Did they become colonized by mycorrhizal fungi and therefore they attracted some of the antagonists  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:36):**  that would suppress the pathogens and that part was known either.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:40):**  But the system worked.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:42):**  That's the beauty of it.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:43):**  His system worked.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  He was the only thing that mattered.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:47):**  He probably didn't, I don't know if he read scientific papers, but he heard and talked  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:52):**  to other people like Ken Pegg over there and got some advice on putting calcium in there  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:57):**  and liming the soil and don't just chop up the organic matter but lay it over and build  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  up this thick layer around the trees.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:08):**  That was a nifty system.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  Now how many orchards could be doing that?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  But right now we're orchards on the soil surface.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  They're clean.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:16):**  They've used herbicides.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  They've used all kinds of things to make it easier for them to get a tractor in there  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  I guess.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  Ashburner, he was able to pick avocados but he probably couldn't get a tractor around  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  the tree because of the mulch which he didn't want to disturb.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  So the farmer has to kind of consider a whole bunch of things.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:35):**  Each case is individual.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  If you were to go into depth and say, okay, here's a farmer that has phytoarthic capsulacy  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  on peppers.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:44):**  What is the cultural practice that they're using right now and what could be changed  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  to reduce the incidence of that disease if they wanted to grow peppers there?  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  They could go out a year or two and grow a cover crop of something that would build up  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  antagonistic organisms to that particular pathogen.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  They may or may not be willing to do that just because of the economics.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:07):**  Corn growers know they're going to lose money as you just said.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:10):**  And so they put something on as insurance and there are all kinds of people put things  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  on as insurance against an accident that may never happen or the potential for it to happen  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:19):**  might not have even been there.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  They spend a lot of money doing that.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  They need something else and say, well, why don't you spend your money some other way?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:28):**  You and I might try to convince them that to go a biological way would be better than  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  putting a chemical on that would do nothing but disappear, not have any effect on anything  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  except screw up the populations of something.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:39):**  Yeah, it actually has a negative effect instead of a positive effect on the overall system  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  over particularly over time.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  You've touched on mycorrhizae and you've mentioned how they recruit antagonistic organisms that  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  suppress pathogens.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:54):**  And I think the conversation around mycorrhizal fungi, solubilizing phosphorus and increasing  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  phosphorus supply and so forth is becoming a fairly well-known conversation.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  That this interaction that is effective in being a recruiting agent, if you will, is  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:13):**  not as widely known.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  Can you expand on that a little bit more and tell us more about what's happening and what's  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  going on?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  I'd love to expand on it.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  The two papers I sent you also have to do with that very concept, the mycorrhizosphere  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:23):**  concept.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  And while those papers are complicated for many people to read, the concept is pretty  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  straightforward.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  Unfortunately, the only place that I published that information was in those two chapters.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  They were talks that I gave and I've included information there on increasing the antagonistic  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  potential in the presence of mycorrhizae that didn't happen in the absence of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  That's the key point.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:49):**  And while most people think about mycorrhizae in terms of phosphorus uptake potential, that's  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  only part of the story.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:56):**  This other part is maybe even more important.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  The same with mycorrhizae fungi increasing the aggregation in soil, improves the tilt  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  of the soil.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:07):**  That's not so widely appreciated.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  But this idea of recruiting organisms from a background to build up populations at a  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  high enough level to suppress a pathogen so the antagonistic potential is increased, that  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:20):**  should be a good thing.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  In all cases, we ran about six or seven different pathogens and in each case the antagonistic  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  potential was increased against each of those pathogens, but the organisms that might have  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  been involved for one pathogen wouldn't necessarily be the ones that are involved for another  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  pathogen.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  But collectively, the antagonistic potential overall in that assay system, which also was  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  never published, was increased.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:46):**  So that's kind of a general statement.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  You can increase the antagonistic potential of any of its pathogens by having mycorrhizae  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  present to begin with.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  So you put the mycorrhizae in, the organisms are there.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  They come running and they get recruited to the team.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:01):**  And then if you do that enough, you have increased the antagonistic potential of the soil.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  So when you plant your next crop, there are more antagonists that are there to keep the  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  pathogen from doing anything or doing much.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:14):**  Fundamentally, what you're describing is that if you are successful, when you are successful  
**[0:40:21-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  in developing robust mycorrhizal populations, then in reality we don't even need to know  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  all of the specific antagonists or specific diseases, that those can be recruited from  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:34):**  the soil and we develop a general resistance as a result of the mycorrhizal recruitment.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  Well, let me just say what the technique was that we developed.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  If you had a soil from around the mycorrhizal system versus control without mycorrhizae,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  we isolated 48 different looking bacteria from those two systems and then we challenged  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:40:59):**  that with a pathogen.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  We used to lay theopsis, black root rot pathogen, as a test organism.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  And then we looked at the zones of inhibition around each of the bacterial colonies that  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  were on there.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:11):**  And we could evaluate and come to what we call the antagonistic potential index, which  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:17):**  was a reflection of all the organisms.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:20):**  We didn't know what they were, they could have been lots of the same organism, but the  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  antagonistic potential, and still potential, tested, but the potential to suppress pathogen  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:29):**  was greatly increased in the presence of mycorrhizae as opposed to the absence of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  So it didn't make any difference, but these were all bacteria by the way.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  And that's one-sided in the sense that there could also be antagonistic fungi, which we  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:44):**  did not measure in those tests.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  But let's just say there's trichodermas there too, and trichodermas can have the same kind  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:50):**  of effect.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:51):**  Well if you did the same kind of an assay to measure the antagonistic potential against  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  the specific pathogen, this is the strain that's in that field, then it doesn't really  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  make any difference what the organisms are.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  You can say that that pathogen will be suppressed by that population of organisms in the mycorrhizosphere.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  It's really kind of a fundamental concept, but needs to be tested.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:15):**  And by the way, most laboratories, with only one exception that I know of, ever even tried  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  to measure antagonistic potential and put a number on it.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  There used to be a lab in Southern California, BBC Labs, that used to do that.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  You send them your pathogen, they can look at the soil and find out what the antagonistic  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:35):**  potential is, whatever the treatment was in the soil.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  Are there more antagonists against that pathogen than not?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:41):**  Well they give you a high, low, and medium number.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  We actually try to actually count them.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:48):**  And we did that based on the zone of inhibition around the bacterial colony once we oversprayed  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  with the pathogen.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:54):**  You take Canadian, for example, sprayed over the whole plate, find out those bacterial  
**[0:42:59-0:43:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:42:59):**  colonies that showed a zone of inhibition where the spores didn't germinate, you know  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:06):**  what I'm saying, a zone of inhibition.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  And you can count all the population on that plate and the size of the zone of inhibition  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:14):**  and come up with the antagonist potential index.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:17):**  When we consider the implications of what you are describing and the capacity that Mike  
**[0:43:22-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  or I have as a recruiting agent, in essence, we've known that they were a very important  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  foundational species to manage well, and this just emphasizes that to an even greater degree.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  And I think this should lead us to ask questions that you are perhaps uniquely qualified to  
**[0:43:40-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:40):**  answer, which is what is the best way to inoculate and develop and maintain a mycorrhizal population?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  There are lots of questions about tillage.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  Can I till my soils and how do I maintain a mycorrhizal population or redevelop it in  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  a tilled soil environment?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  How do I establish a mycorrhizal population in an orchard system where the trees are 10  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:05):**  years old and I want to keep them for another 20 years or longer?  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  So I think there are lots of questions about how we manage mycorrhizae in some of these  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:11):**  different environments that there are many people who have the questions and few who  
**[0:44:16-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:16):**  seem to have good answers.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  What are your thoughts?  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  Well, the first question that comes with any of the crops, do they already have mycorrhizae?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  I mean, tree crops that are growing or grapevines that are growing, if they don't have mycorrhizae  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:28):**  already, they're not growing.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:31):**  Grapes can't survive without mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  So then the question is, do I have to add more and would it do any good if I added more?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  Well, the answer to that could be probably not.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  But the idea of establishing mycorrhizae when you transplant into that grapevine, into that,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  if they're already inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi, so they're already mycorrhizal to begin  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:52):**  with, that's the best you could hope for.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  Inoculate at the time you transplant.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:58):**  If you can't inoculate the transplant, then when you transplant, at least put inoculum  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  in the soil, in the hole, where the roots are going to run into it right away.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:09):**  That's really all you can do.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  You can't put it on the top of the soil and hope it's going to wash down.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:14):**  Some of it will.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:15):**  You can put some of it on seed because some of it will wash off the seed and get to the  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  roots, not as efficiently as bacteria would, like rhizobium.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:25):**  You can put that on the seed.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:27):**  But that's another way of delivering it.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  That's the kind of crop, you're not doing a transplant, you're doing the seeding.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  If you're going to do seed, put it on the seed in high enough population, enough it  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  will wash down the root system, or put it right under the seed.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:41):**  That's the only advice that I can give to people as far as mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:47):**  Then manage the kind of fertility that will favor the development of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  Don't put a lot of phosphorus fertilizer on and suppress them.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  This leads me to two follow-up questions that we just described, which the first question  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:02):**  is if you have an established system and you ask the question, are they already colonized  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  the mycorrhizae?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  My question would be, how can we establish that?  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  How can we know that?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  Are there laboratory assays that growers can use to identify that?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  Unfortunately, I don't know that many places that will do it, but yes, you can do it.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  I do it all the time here.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  You have to collect the feeder roots from that plant, whether it's grapes or beans  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  or whatever.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:29):**  You clear and stain the roots and find out if they're colonized.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:34):**  There are ways that the experimental people do this all the time.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  They actually quantify it.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  We posted a paper a long time ago on quantifying mycorrhizae.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  But a clearing and staining process allows you to detect the propagules of the mycorrhizal  
**[0:46:47-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:47):**  fungus or structures that indicate mycorrhizae in roots, like hyphae, like spores, that tell  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  you even to the point of saying no mycorrhizae, low mycorrhizae, medium, high, that would  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:03):**  give a grower an idea that in fact mycorrhizae are there and probably functioning.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  I can't even tell you what labs will do that.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  I do know that people can quantify the population of spores in their commercial soils labs that  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  do that sort of thing.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  But that's just a number of spores.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  If you ever had roots that were colonized, you clear and stain them and find out if you  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  see mycorrhizae.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  I say I do that in my lab all the time.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:31):**  I mean not all the time, but if somebody asked.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  If people put material on a product, on like a mycorrhizal product, anybody's product,  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  and they get effects, the question that comes in my mind immediately is did they actually  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:45):**  form mycorrhizae or was the effect due to something else?  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  Some of the products are actually laid with fertilizer, so they're actually getting a  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  fertilizer effect and they didn't actually form mycorrhizae.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:57):**  Even when they see really striking results, what happened to the mycorrhizal population?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  There are organic products, one that I can think of right now is called C-crop.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  They extract organic materials from ocean water and make a product called C-crop.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  They put it on, they get growth effects.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  Question is did they actually encourage mycorrhizal fungi or some other beneficial system, microbial  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  system?  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:22):**  They all claim that they probably do, but there's no evidence of it.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  They could have that evidence, they just don't do it.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  I've actually volunteered for some of those people that have products like that to say  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  send me roots of the treated plants versus the control and I can tell you if there are  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  more mycorrhizae on the treated ones than the controls.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  Yeah, I imagine you haven't been taken up on that offer very often.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  No, exactly right.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:47):**  There were tests being done in South Carolina for example, I can't remember what the crop  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  was right now.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  I can't think of it.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  It was a legume actually.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  Did you actually with that product form more nodules that fix more nitrogen?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  Yes or no?  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:05):**  More nodules or less nodules?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  What kind of nodules too?  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  If you've got more nodules when you use that product than if you didn't use that product,  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:16):**  then you have some information.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  You can say our product stimulates the formation of nodules of rhizobium on this, maybe it  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  was peanuts for example.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  And then you get to the situation, you get more nodules formed of rhizobium in the presence  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  of specific strains of mycorrhizal fungi than if you don't have that strain of mycorrhizal  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  fungus.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  A paper we published in 1993, not appreciated by most people, surely not the nitrogen fixing  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  people.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  If you don't have that combination of mycorrhizal plus rhizobium, you don't get the full bang.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:52):**  Something that we've observed many times is that when we apply inoculants of various types  
**[0:49:55-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:55):**  without mycorrhizal, we don't get the response that you do when you combine it with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  The same thing would happen if you applied mycorrhizal fungi plus a plant growth promoting  
**[0:50:05-0:50:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  rhizobacterium, PGPR.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:09):**  We published a paper that showed, one of the first papers that's almost never cited because  
**[0:50:13-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:13):**  it was so early, in the presence of mycorrhizae and this pseudomonad, you actually had a change

**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:25):**  get if you were separate.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  This reminds me of an experience that we had a couple of years ago with a, this was a spinach  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  crop in California being irrigated with various saline irrigation water.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:36):**  Very high sodium level, very high chloride levels.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  It was in fact so high that the spinach crop was bitter and the leaf edges were burnt and  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  the crop was, I can't say that it was entirely unmarketable, but it was largely unmarketable  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  and yields were severely depressed because of the high sodium levels.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:52):**  And we were working with this bacterial inoculant that has been known to somehow sequester or  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:59):**  lock up or tie up sodium levels.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  They no longer show up in the leaf tissue or in plant sap and they no longer show up  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  in the soil.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  And we've gotten some very nice responses, but in this particular case, the sodium levels  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  were so high that even though the levels were dropping a little bit, we were not getting  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:17):**  the response that we had seen in other areas and the crop was still challenged and so forth.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  Well, our consultant noticed that the one row of spinach right at the field edge was  
**[0:51:28-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  perfect.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  It looked really awesome.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:30):**  It didn't have any leaf burning effect from the high sodium levels.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  It was planted right beside a row of carrots in the neighboring field.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  It was like 16 inch spacing between the rows fairly closely together and the carrots had  
**[0:51:44-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:44):**  been inoculated with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  So we repeated our experiments on the spinach where we put on this inoculant again in the  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:53):**  bio stimulant combined with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  And we went from getting very poor performance to getting very good performance.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  The sodium levels in the soil dropped dramatically.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  The spinach crop performed exceptionally well.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:06):**  We were able to produce full harvests for multiple cuttings after that and completely  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  turned the situation around.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  And I find this particularly interesting because this is shifting a little bit now, I understand,  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:17):**  but when we had this experience, probably seven or eight years ago at this point, spinach  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:23):**  is considered to be a crop that is not associated with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  And yet it still showed that pronounced positive response to the presence of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  What are your thoughts about that?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  Well again, to the question, were there actually mycorrhizae that for whatever reason at this  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:42):**  point actually formed mycorrhizae with spinach?  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:46):**  If there weren't any mycorrhizae formed there, but they were present because they inoculated,  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:51):**  what did you inoculate with?  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:52):**  What kind of inoculant was there?  
**[0:52:54-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  The inoculum mycorrhizal fungi can contain many other organisms, some of which were originally  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  associated with mycorrhizae when the pot culture was being grown.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  So you may be adding some beneficial organisms just because they were there in the inoculum.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:14):**  Now I've actually heard that kind of a story before and people say, well, I know I had  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  to say, well spinach doesn't form mycorrhizae so that wasn't what was going on.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  It didn't form mycorrhizae, but you might have formed, and this is true in many, many  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:26):**  cases, the inoculants formed in a pot culture system can contain many of these associates  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  as the inoculum was being produced and they are also added, as you know, in our own product.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  You're adding a lot of organisms plus the mycorrhizae.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  If the spinach didn't form mycorrhizae, it also got a dose of all the other beneficial  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  organisms that were associated with mycorrhizae back in the previous stage.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:54):**  There are other examples where, for example, tomato wilt.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:53:57):**  This is an example in Japan.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:00):**  When they planted onions next to the tomato plants in a greenhouse situation where they  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:06):**  were growing greenhouse tomatoes, they didn't have fusarium wilt anymore.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:11):**  What did the onion bring to the system to change the soil biology in such a way that  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  you didn't get wilt?  
**[0:54:19-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  They actually created a suppressive soil situation there by adding onions in amongst the tomatoes.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  You just changed the whole biology.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  There's also the business of what we call nurse crops.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  You can actually form mycorrhizae on one plant and then have it be transferred from that  
**[0:54:38-0:54:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  crop onto the corn plant, for example, in strip planting situations.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:44):**  It could be happening, but there's not much documentation of it.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  I know what was happening in Colorado.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  I actually suggested they do that, but they had strip tilled plant corn, but they had  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:54):**  rye before.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  There was a potential that mycorrhizal fungus vegetatively moved through the soil, got onto  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  the corn roots earlier than otherwise, and you got an increase in yield because they  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  formed mycorrhizae early enough to show some benefit.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  This raises an interesting question.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  It's getting to be fairly well understood that if you want to have good mycorrhizal  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  colonization shortly after planting, then putting on soluble phosphorus fertilizers  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  in the fertilizer starter is probably a really bad idea.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:28):**  The question that I've been asked occasionally when growers realize their mistake shortly  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  after the beginning of the season, they ask the question, can I inoculate mycorrhizae  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  when the plant is already six inches or eight inches tall in the case of the corn plant?  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:44):**  Is it possible if they've applied that soluble phosphorus fertilizer, how much does that  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  delay colonization?  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:51):**  Is it possible to re-inoculate later in the season and still have an effect on the crop  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:55):**  that they're able to get it down into the soil profile?  
**[0:55:57-0:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  Well, the potential is there for sure.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:00):**  The question is, what happened to the phosphorus that they put on?  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:02):**  Did it get tied up?  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  The phosphorus-fixing capacity of the soil is really critical.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:07):**  If it got tied up and was no longer in the soluble form, then adding inoculum later and  
**[0:56:14-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:14):**  washing it down enough and the sores are large, they don't wash really readily.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  But if you could get it down in the root system, yes, there's potential to farm mycorrhizae  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:22):**  after the phosphorus is already tied up.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:24):**  The soluble phosphorus that you put on, in your soils, I don't know what the phosphorus-fixing  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:30):**  capacity is, but in our areas out here, it gets tied up pretty fast.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  In many agricultural soils that I have experience with, phosphorus applications are usually  
**[0:56:40-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  tied up in some cases in days, but most often certainly in weeks and occasionally months.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  I was going to say, we've done that experiment and it was days.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:51):**  Yes.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:52):**  If most people realize how much money they waste on phosphorus applications, they would  
**[0:56:56-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  stop spending money pretty quickly because it's a complete waste, or largely a waste.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:01):**  Yes, I don't know any examples of people that have actually tried to do that post-inoculation.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:05):**  Because they realize they put too much phosphorus on.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  If it's in the soil situation, the phosphorus-fixing capacity is really a critical thing.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  If you're in a potting mix, there's no phosphorus-fixing capacity in potting mixes.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:20):**  It almost goes straight through.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  You'd stay in the pot.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  That's another important point.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  If these people are going to do transplants, then they could be inoculating with all kinds  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:32):**  of things onto the transplant so that they're preloaded when they go out into the field.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  After we talked the other day, I got a paper that came to me on my computer.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:43):**  It's not a new paper.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:44):**  It's 2018.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:45):**  Here's the title.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  Biocontrol measures against onion basil rot, this is a fusarium, onion basil rot incidents  
**[0:57:52-0:57:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:52):**  under natural field conditions.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:57:54):**  They tried two species of trichoderma, one Pseudomonas and one Bacillus, and they got  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:00):**  much better control of the disease by inoculating the seedlings before they transplanted, by  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  dipping them in these suspensions, transplanting them, they got better disease than they get  
**[0:58:10-0:58:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:10):**  with the chemical that they use to compare to.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:13):**  That's the very concept we're talking about here.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  If you're going to do transplants or bulbs or whatever, cuttings, inoculate the transplant  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:23):**  before it goes into the field.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  We actually published a paper.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  I keep referring to these papers and I'm sorry because they point to the idea that pre-inoculation  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:33):**  with mycorrhizal fungi is the most efficient way you can deliver the fungi to the plant  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:39):**  system and have it on there when it goes out into the field, whether it's grapes or it's  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  onions or it's whatever.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  Draining doesn't really make any difference.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  Pre-inoculation prevents transplant shock, whatever that amounts to, so you have more  
**[0:58:55-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  plants that survive.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  Even under salty conditions, we have a paper on very high salt conditions and pre-inoculated  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:02):**  with mycorrhizal fungi, they tolerated the salt and they didn't if they didn't have mycorrhizae.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:07):**  Just the transplant shock itself, pre-inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi geraniums, transplant,  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:13):**  there's all kinds of things why you have transplant shock and the plants don't go very well if  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:18):**  you hadn't pre-inoculated.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  There's a paper published on that.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:21):**  So all of this points to the idea of pre-inoculating transplants or a propagule, whatever it's  
**[0:59:26-0:59:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  going to be, even seed, if that were efficient with the organism that you want, then that's  
**[0:59:34-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:34):**  what they ought to do.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  I mean, back to the systemic approach, that would be the one common thing that they ought  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:40):**  to do.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  There's a whole business of seed priming.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:45):**  Seed priming, I know you know this already.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:48):**  You could do seed priming with things like polyethylene glycol that will change the osmotic  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  potential, but you could also do seed priming with antagonistic organisms.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:00):**  And if you're worried about Pythium damping off right away, you can pre-inoculate the  
**[1:00:05-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:05):**  seed and prevent that from happening because it happens within hours after the seed are  
**[1:00:09-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  transplanted.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  So the seed starts to germinate, they became infected.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:14):**  Pre-emergent damping off or post-emergent damping off, but you get protection by inoculating  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  the seed.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:19):**  I don't know how many people do that.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  I don't know how many people do seed priming, but the idea of doing it at the same time  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:25):**  you're doing seed priming against uniform seed germination is a good thing.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:30):**  I almost never talk, I try to never talk about products in our interviews, in our podcast  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  interviews, but I think a lot of our listeners would appreciate knowing that the product  
**[1:00:42-1:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  that we've developed called BioCoat Gold uses Dr. Minderman's Microagricle Fungi.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:46):**  And also a lot of these antagonistic organisms that we're speaking about.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:50):**  So I've observed a lot of these effects in the field and I didn't expect to quite get  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  into this conversation when we started here, but I think it's important to just let everyone  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  know.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:00):**  I know many of you have experienced the incredible effectiveness that this product can have on  
**[1:01:04-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:04):**  managing some of these diseases.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:05):**  And these are some of the principles, interactions that are going on behind it.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  So I think there's a key phrase that you mentioned, Bob, when you were speaking about the first  
**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:13):**  paper you mentioned a moment ago regarding the onion basil rot, you used the word effectiveness  
**[1:01:20-1:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  as compared to a fungicide.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:23):**  And we have adopted a model of agriculture today where for some reason we just expect  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:31):**  that fungicides or insecticides are the best tools that are out there.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:35):**  They're the easy tools, they're the tools that we're familiar with.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  And immediately in our mind, when we start thinking about biocontrols, they get compared  
**[1:01:45-1:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:45):**  against the fungicide.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:46):**  How does a biocontrol compare against the fungicide?  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:49):**  Our own experience in the field has been that in many cases, not in all cases, but in the  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  great majority of cases, the biocontrols are actively more effective than the fungicides.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:00):**  In fact, we just had an experience recently, the conversation we had a couple of days ago  
**[1:02:05-1:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:05):**  regarding phytophthora and peppers where the chemical sales rep acknowledged directly to  
**[1:02:11-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:11):**  the grill room and said, the product that we are selling you to control phytophthora  
**[1:02:15-1:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  doesn't work.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:16):**  It's not effective.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  And yet it's what is being sold.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:19):**  It's what we've come to expect as being effective to control a certain disease.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  So I'd love to hear your professional perspective as a scientist who has looked at these things.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:28):**  What are typical effectiveness rates of biocontrols as compared to fungicides and products in  
**[1:02:34-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:34):**  a jug?  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  Well, that's a big one.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  Well, that's a big one.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:40):**  But you know, the strategy paper I referred to earlier, we have a quote in there that  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:44):**  I'm going to use to answer the question.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:47):**  This came from actually Jim Cook and Ken Baker.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:51):**  Quote is, biological control is not inherently spectacular.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  Its successes tend to be overlooked or attributed to other factors.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:00):**  And the spectacular responses that you could get from a chemical because it's going to  
**[1:03:04-1:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:04):**  be short or sometimes short lived or it just don't occur, whereas the biological systems  
**[1:03:11-1:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:11):**  eventually will give you the best outcome.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:15):**  But they're not spectacular because they don't happen instantly.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:18):**  That's the instant gratification of using an insecticide or a fungicide.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:24):**  If it works, you see results.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  You don't really necessarily see the results of biological systems until the end, into  
**[1:03:33-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:33):**  the crop or later, like ash burners.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  His trees recovered.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:37):**  Well, it didn't happen overnight as a whole system.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:41):**  But his trees did recover as he developed healthy roots to support the tree.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  The same thing could be happening in peppers, but you're talking about an annual crop.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:50):**  So you need to get started early in the system.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  And chemicals, I mean, even fumigants don't necessarily get to all the places in the soil.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  So if you drench with something like ritamol, you may not get it to where the propagals  
**[1:04:04-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  of the pathogen are.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:05):**  So you may get the ineffectiveness for that, not to mention resistance to the pathogen  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  to that particular material, which is known.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:14):**  So I don't know how to compare because we don't have one on one.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:19):**  I've got a field where I put biological control systems on versus I put chemicals on and say,  
**[1:04:23-1:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:23):**  well, what's the percentage take?  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:25):**  In your blog, you've referred to a lot of the treatments that have gone on for years  
**[1:04:29-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:29):**  and all.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  We don't know what a real healthy looking plant even looks like anymore because yields  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:34):**  are down and the leaves are smaller and they don't look like they're performing very well.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  As a result of long term applications of chemicals, whether it's herbicides or other chemicals,  
**[1:04:46-1:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:46):**  that change the biology in such a way that you don't get the performance.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  The plant doesn't grow normally anymore or what it used to have, what it used to see,  
**[1:04:55-1:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  you don't see anymore.  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:04:56):**  I'm really grateful to be alive in this day at this moment in time to be able to help  
**[1:05:02-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  bring about the change in how we grow food and how we manage our agriculture.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:08):**  And at the same time, I also would have loved to be present to see some of the fields and  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:16):**  orchards that I see in old photos.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  I have, my father helped, worked on an orchard in his teens, it was probably 40 years ago  
**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:25):**  now, where they had old apple trees that were two and a half to three feet in diameter with  
**[1:05:32-1:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:32):**  branches on the first layer of branches where the branches were 20 inches to two feet in  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  diameter and the trees were 40 feet in diameter altogether.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:42):**  And they had no diseases.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:44):**  They sprayed no fungicides.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:46):**  They sprayed no insecticides because they had these incredibly large robust root systems  
**[1:05:51-1:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:51):**  and they had the entire system working.  
**[1:05:53-1:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:53):**  So obviously that's not a system that is transferable today with our labor environment and everything  
**[1:05:57-1:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:57):**  else.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:05:58):**  But I think there are still many things that we can learn from the way that crops were  
**[1:06:01-1:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  grown in that era without any fungicide and insecticide applications.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:05):**  My father had a big garden too.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  He wasn't a farmer, but he had a big garden and he never put fungicides on anything.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:11):**  And he grew the best corn, the best strawberries.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  But I can remember going down to the docks with him where they load salmon heads on in  
**[1:06:18-1:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:18):**  his trailer as he worked.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:19):**  He worked for the post office.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  He got them home at night with a trailer load of fish heads.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  We took the salmon cheeks out for dinner and the rest of it got buried under the strawberry  
**[1:06:32-1:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:32):**  in rows and you wouldn't believe the strawberries he grew.  
**[1:06:34-1:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:34):**  He never put a fungicide on anything in his garden.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:38):**  And that's the kind of thing that we kind of strive right now to get back to.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:44):**  There are so many limitations that occur.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:46):**  I mean it's like organic matter.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  You need to put more organic matter in your soil.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  Well where do I get the organic matter?  
**[1:06:53-1:06:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:53):**  Well it's produced in three or four states over.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:06:57):**  So there's a shipment cost.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  Transporting these materials to where big farmers can put it on a field and the volumes  
**[1:07:04-1:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  that need to be there to do the good.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:06):**  That's almost impossible.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:07):**  This reminds me of an important topic that we haven't yet spoken about and that is  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:12):**  the potential to produce your own organic matter locally on your own fields.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:17):**  I'm passionate about the potential of plants to increase their photosynthesis to much higher  
**[1:07:22-1:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:22):**  levels and to sequester a lot more carbon simply as a result of having more efficient  
**[1:07:27-1:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:27):**  photosynthesis.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:28):**  What is the impact of myorrhizal colonization on photosynthetic efficiency?  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  Well you had that on your list and I was glad you asked it because there is a paper from  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  if you look at it in the mycorrhizal literature, Gabe Bethlen-Pauvey was a scientist who worked  
**[1:07:45-1:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:45):**  on mycorrhizae.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:46):**  He was in California and transferred into my unit up here before he retired.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  They did work on increased photosynthesis with mycorrhizae compared to plants that didn't  
**[1:07:57-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:57):**  have it.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:07:58):**  There definitely is an increase in photosynthetic capacity with mycorrhizae compared to without.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:06):**  How that translates into the field situation, how many mycorrhizae, I don't have an answer  
**[1:08:11-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:11):**  to that.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  Early in our conversation you mentioned the possible food sources that could be used to  
**[1:08:17-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:17):**  enhance fungal microbial communities and you made mention of chitin as one possible food  
**[1:08:24-1:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:24):**  source.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:25):**  Actually, my thoughts go in two different directions.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  One is what is the potential of using chitin as a food source to develop mycorrhizal and  
**[1:08:34-1:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:34):**  other fungal populations and kind of related to that, as soon as I started asking that  
**[1:08:39-1:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:39):**  question another question popped into my mind.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:41):**  We also haven't spoken about the impact of mycorrhizae on nematode control which I think  
**[1:08:46-1:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  is kind of connected to that.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:49):**  Well there is good literature on nematode control in the presence of mycorrhizal nematode  
**[1:08:53-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:53):**  populations or activity is definitely decreased.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  So there is a lot of evidence of that.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:02):**  As far as adding chitin to support specific groups of organisms, they do support actinomycetes  
**[1:09:08-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  if you add chitin but I don't know anything about the mycorrhizal part of it.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  The only study that has actually been done where you say add chitin and you get more  
**[1:09:17-1:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:17):**  mycorrhizae.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:18):**  It is something that could be done but I just don't think that it has been done specifically.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  It gets back to if you added chitin and you get certain responses.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:31):**  I have a colleague here that just asked me that question the other day.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:33):**  We added chitin, some other people did an experiment up in Oregon here where they added  
**[1:09:40-1:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  crab shell and crab shell is being added into some premix kind of things.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:46):**  I saw the examples in that experiment where roots were actually stimulated by the presence  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:51):**  of crab shell in the medium.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:55):**  What caused that is really not known.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:09:59):**  Did we change the population of anything microbiologically other than chitinase producing actinomycetes?  
**[1:10:08-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  I don't know anybody that knows the answer to that and I don't know about for mycorrhizal  
**[1:10:12-1:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  fungi.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:13):**  If you added chitin do you get more mycorrhizae?  
**[1:10:14-1:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  I don't know the answer to that.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:16):**  But again if you did that experiment that is one more step to take and you would have  
**[1:10:22-1:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:22):**  the answer.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:23):**  Take the roots of the plants that are treated versus the ones that aren't treated and clear  
**[1:10:27-1:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:27):**  and stain them and find out what the level of mycorrhizae is.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:31):**  It is rather simple.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:33):**  It is not done.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:35):**  Not usually done.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:36):**  I have reviewed a lot of papers where I say did you actually look at mycorrhizae on your  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  roots?  
**[1:10:42-1:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  Well no we didn't look.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:43):**  Well you can talk about the effects of mycorrhizae but can you really attribute that to mycorrhizae  
**[1:10:50-1:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:50):**  and or their associates?  
**[1:10:51-1:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:51):**  This all happens when it doesn't happen with mycorrhizae by itself most often.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:10:55):**  It is a team effort which is the whole mycorrhizosphere concept.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:00):**  So let's expand a little bit on nematode treatment.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  Does mycorrhizal association and the whole teamwork that comes with mycorrhizal association  
**[1:11:12-1:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:12):**  provide enough nematode control that it can be an effective treatment for root knot nematodes  
**[1:11:16-1:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:16):**  and other similar nematodes?  
**[1:11:18-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:18):**  I believe it could.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  I actually couldn't tell you that it has been done and I have to think back to some papers  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:25):**  on nematode suppression.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:29):**  Basically have looked at even the products that were out there that were heightened based,  
**[1:11:36-1:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:36):**  looked at changes in behavior of the nematodes that are fewer eggs laid heightened in the  
**[1:11:43-1:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:43):**  surface of eggs.  
**[1:11:45-1:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:45):**  All the effects were on the nematode per se without knowing whether there were other associated  
**[1:11:50-1:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:50):**  organisms that were with the mycorrhizal fungi that actually did those sorts of things.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:55):**  There are people in Riverside, California that are looking at bacteria that are nematode  
**[1:11:59-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  suppressing in various ways.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  What they don't include in their systems are where the mycorrhizal is present.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  They just looked at one part of it but they may have associated their added organism with  
**[1:12:16-1:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:16):**  mycorrhizal fungi and it was a team effort.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:19):**  They don't ever look at the other part of the team.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  I have not been to meetings out here for the years.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:26):**  I am not going to so many meetings anymore but people in Riverside have done some really  
**[1:12:29-1:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:29):**  good work on, I can't even tell you which bacteria they are using, but they find some  
**[1:12:36-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:36):**  that are suppressive to nematodes.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:39):**  When they say suppressive to nematodes that may mean the reproductive capacity is influenced,  
**[1:12:46-1:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:46):**  fewer eggs laid, fewer eggs hatched, fewer first stage nematodes.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  Those are the kinds of things that were majored in a plant with mycorrhizal versus ones that  
**[1:12:58-1:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:12:58):**  didn't have mycorrhizae.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:01):**  But if they are looking at the bacterial part of it, looking for antagonistic bacteria against  
**[1:13:05-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:05):**  nematodes, they leave out the mycorrhizal part of it.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  So you don't know if they are involved or not.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:12):**  Or if they help the bacteria that they added do its job, they may have teamed up.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:17):**  Bob, you have shared lots of wisdom and knowledge that you have gained over the years.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:22):**  I am sure there are many conversations more that we could have like this.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  But there is one important question that I want to get to.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  What is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[1:13:35-1:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:35):**  You put that on your list and I thought about it a lot.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:39):**  I would like farmers to know that biological options are available.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  That they should consider biological things at least equally and maybe preferentially  
**[1:13:53-1:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:53):**  over chemical treatments.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:13:55):**  And until farmers begin to ask the kind of questions that you are asking and you are  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:01):**  asking sort of for them, we are not going to get those kinds of answers.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:06):**  That kind of means that there have to be more people to step up and try to get the answers  
**[1:14:10-1:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:10):**  to those questions.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  And unfortunately those people are few and far between.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  We have actually done away in the U.S. with mycorrhizae people.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:22):**  They don't exist anymore.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:25):**  The USDA at one time I had a meeting of all the mycorrhizae people of the ARS in the country.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  We all got together and talked.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:36):**  Most of those people are retired or were closed out.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:39):**  They don't do mycorrhizae stuff anymore.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:42):**  And that is unfortunate because I would like to see the biological control approach favored  
**[1:14:48-1:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:48):**  as opposed to chemical approaches.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:53):**  And it's shifting that way but it's taking a while.  
**[1:14:55-1:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  I mean there are more products that are out there right now but the products are out there  
**[1:14:59-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:14:59):**  simply from a market point of view.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  They find these organisms sometimes based on really flimsy evidence and not real field  
**[1:15:06-1:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:06):**  evidence.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:07):**  And the erythropytridish assay, which I do too.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:11):**  I see these organisms all the time.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:13):**  I isolate the bacteria.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:15):**  I try to put them on and test against the pathogens that I'm working with specifically.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:21):**  Even their pathogens in the nursery, things like cylindracladium, rhizoctonia, phytophthors,  
**[1:15:26-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:26):**  Pythiums.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  By the way, Pythium antagonists are really hard to come by.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:32):**  I rarely find a product that really works against the Pythium isolates that I have.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:39):**  And it's because Pythiums are so fast, Rhizoctonias are so fast.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:43):**  And both of those organisms by the way grow vegetatively through soil.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:48):**  So it's really hard to find organisms that will slow them down.  
**[1:15:53-1:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:53):**  I keep looking for them but I haven't found a lot yet.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:15:56):**  So that's I guess the answer to my question.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:01):**  I'd like farmers to consider biological systems.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:04):**  Bob, what is a topic that you would like to speak about more often to growers but you  
**[1:16:11-1:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:11):**  don't because you sense they may not be ready to consider it?  
**[1:16:16-1:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:16):**  What topics?  
**[1:16:19-1:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:19):**  Well again I'm trying to answer the same question.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:23):**  I don't think most of the discussions that are going on right now don't have enough  
**[1:16:28-1:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:28):**  to do with biological systems.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:29):**  I mean you're an exception in that you bring the subject up in everything that you do.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:38):**  You can go back to all kinds of questions about cover crops and organic amendments and  
**[1:16:43-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:43):**  biological products that are added.  
**[1:16:46-1:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:46):**  Again it gets down to if they aren't as spectacular or the potential results are  
**[1:16:53-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:53):**  not so spectacular that their farmers are not likely to go there, I'd like them to  
**[1:16:59-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  be more tenacious than that and stay with it until they figure it out.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  I gave a talk one time on learning from all the mistakes I've made.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:10):**  I did this experiment.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:11):**  Why didn't it work?  
**[1:17:13-1:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  What went wrong?  
**[1:17:14-1:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:14):**  You learned a lot from your mistake.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  Why didn't it work?  
**[1:17:19-1:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:19):**  Why didn't mycorrhizal form on my onions?  
**[1:17:21-1:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:21):**  Well it's because you did such and such.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  You put it in a gandhi spreader and spread it all over the field but not put it where  
**[1:17:27-1:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:27):**  it needed to be.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:29):**  Or you did it too late.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  But if you analyze all the mistakes that people make, if they made mistakes, I tried that  
**[1:17:37-1:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:37):**  but it didn't work, why didn't it work?  
**[1:17:41-1:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:41):**  How can we change the approach so that it would work?  
**[1:17:45-1:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:45):**  And your system, you have all kinds of consultants and farm advisors and things that are out  
**[1:17:51-1:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:51):**  there and the farmers are seeing those people some but more than likely the people that  
**[1:17:57-1:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:17:57):**  they see the most are chemical salesmen.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  That's kind of sad in a way but it's probably true.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:06):**  You can confirm that.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Regen_Ag_Podcast_Linderman_FINAL.mp3#t=1:18:07):**  I'm not going to be wrong about that but that's been my experience that growers out here,

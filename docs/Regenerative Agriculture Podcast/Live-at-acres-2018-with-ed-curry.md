**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information

**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems

**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.

**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:09):**  And as he indicated, Ed is the only remaining  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:13):**  open pollinated chili seed breeder in the world.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:16):**  Has been breeding chili peppers with a Mendelian approach,  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:21):**  meaning that he's phenotyping plants by eye,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:24):**  not by a machine.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:26):**  And he's specifically breeding for quality,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:28):**  for a number of different quality characteristics  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:30):**  and working to produce extremely high quality seeds.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:33):**  And I think in the agricultural space,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:36):**  developing high quality seeds is a topic  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:38):**  that is very important and something  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:39):**  that we haven't focused on enough collectively  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:44):**  as a group and as a culture at this point.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:46):**  So I'm very excited to have Ed here with us.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:48):**  Ed, welcome to the show.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:49):**  Thank you for being here.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:50):**  Thank you, John.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:51):**  It's an honor to be here.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:53):**  I'm humbled by this, I gotta tell y'all.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:55):**  I'm a dirt farmer just like most of you.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:04:58):**  And I will start with this.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:02):**  I love what I do.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:03):**  I was trained by the best, Mr. Phil Villa,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:07):**  Ben Villalon, Everett Wood.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:08):**  I've been under several really good pepper geneticists.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:13):**  The one thing we all had in common is it was our life.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:17):**  My growers that I sell seed to take off elk hunting  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:20):**  and deer hunting and I always tell them,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:21):**  you boys go hunt, I'm gonna be looking for better chili.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:25):**  And that's what we spend,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:28):**  I have spent literally my life doing.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:30):**  And I love that my mother and father moved from Oklahoma  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:35):**  in 1952.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:37):**  They had just about starved out  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:39):**  growing dry land peanuts and cotton  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:41):**  and wanted to find a better way, better place.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:44):**  And they found Sulphur Springs Valley in Arizona  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:48):**  and we're a closed basin irrigated farming system.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:53):**  We now use pivots and drip.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:56):**  Back when my dad first moved there,  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:05:58):**  it was all fur irrigated.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:00):**  But in 1957, my dad planted his first crop of chili.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:06):**  I was born in 1956, so our family's been in chili  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:10):**  virtually my whole life.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:12):**  In 1957, he didn't get a stand.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:15):**  And so he really didn't have a chili crop.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:18):**  Determined 1958, he planted again,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:23):**  made his first chili crop.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:25):**  It wasn't great, but he made it.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:27):**  Chili is one of the most diversified  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:30):**  set of gene pools out there.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:33):**  A little over 30,000 genes.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:35):**  For a long time, as they started mapping genomes,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:40):**  we thought it was over 40,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:42):**  but now UC Davis has recently come out  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:44):**  that we're looking at a gene pool of a little over 30,000.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:49):**  That being said, we do it just straight by the eye.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:06:57):**  I look at plant habit, I look at fruit shape,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:00):**  I look at fruit size.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:04):**  We even nail it down to little things  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:06):**  on how the bloom sets, where the stamen is,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:09):**  where the pistil is.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:12):**  We look at the smallest things.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:14):**  And one of the things I love to tell John,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:16):**  I love to tell this is Phil Villa, who trained me,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:21):**  we lost Phil five years ago.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:24):**  And I love to tell this story is Phil,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:28):**  I was a very young man, and he took me on the field  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:32):**  and we're standing in about 60 acres of chili.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:37):**  And he said, all right, you walk out there about 100 foot.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:40):**  And he said, you tell me, you find me 100 plants  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:46):**  that are hot, and we were in a mild field.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:49):**  I couldn't go taste them, I couldn't lift the leaves  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:52):**  and look at the chili, I had to do it strictly by eye.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:07:58):**  I stood there and I got 98 out of 100.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:03):**  When we left the field that day, Phil said, you get it.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:07):**  I'll never forget that.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:09):**  His point, look at the small things.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:13):**  And he had taught me long before I stood there  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:16):**  and we did this test.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:19):**  He taught me about leaf shape, leaf size,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:23):**  pointed keel type leaf, many different things.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:26):**  But all these little things was he wanted me to learn  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:30):**  as a young breeder, look for the little things.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:34):**  And doesn't that fit in life as well?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:36):**  If we take care of the little things,  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:38):**  my dad always said, take care of the little things,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:40):**  the big things will take care of themselves.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:42):**  Well, and plant breeding is certainly true.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:45):**  And so my team, I've developed a team through the years  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:50):**  that we have Manuel Cervantes and David Carton  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:54):**  will work with me there on the farm.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:56):**  Rosanna Zuniga, who is our business manager,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:08:59):**  but also started right in the field with us.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:02):**  Everybody on my team has been with us many, many years,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:07):**  over 20.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:08):**  And the idea here is that we love what we do.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:13):**  And so our lives, we grow our entertainment.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:16):**  We don't have to go hunting.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:17):**  We don't have to leave the farm.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:19):**  We just have to leave the house  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:23):**  and just go into the first field on the farm.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:26):**  And we watch it all year.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:29):**  And John, to your point, something John has brought to me  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:32):**  is how important nutrients are to seed development,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:36):**  to developing.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:37):**  I'm always on the search for better embryo development.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:41):**  In my chase down for this,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:44):**  it's hard for me to sit down and talk.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:48):**  In my chase of a better quality seed and better genetics,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:53):**  we've been in Mexico several years farming,  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:56):**  great experiences, but I learned a lot.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:09:59):**  Went down to the coast.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:00):**  We were about 500 miles south of home there  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:03):**  because Arizona is right against the border.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:05):**  We were about 500 miles south, right on the ocean.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:09):**  John, the first thing I ran into,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:11):**  and the reason I went into Mexico, I might add,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:13):**  is in my early years, I could gain a generation of seed.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:17):**  I could harvest in October.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:19):**  I could take that seed, go down and plant it right away  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:22):**  and get another generation and come back home.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:24):**  And that was the whole idea.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:26):**  John, first thing we did was I went from a soil pH  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:29):**  of six and a half to seven, seven and a half.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:32):**  Sometimes they eat at the highest.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:33):**  Very rare.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:35):**  To a soil pH of nine and a half, 10.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:39):**  Right next to the ocean there.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:40):**  And started seeing how,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:44):**  there were several differences in Mexico.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:46):**  Number one, we were growing wintertime.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:49):**  Short daylight hours changed how the fruit looked.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:52):**  It was really hard to phenotype.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:55):**  This is all, as I look back, it was God's way  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:10:57):**  of bringing my educational process into one.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:01):**  And I started realizing that the phenotyping  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:04):**  was much different than just at home where I seen it.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:09):**  Basically, my biggest customers are in around Hatch,  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:13):**  New Mexico, Deming, Las Cruces.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:16):**  That's my biggest fear.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:17):**  In California, we have a pretty good presence,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:20):**  and we have a good presence in Texas and Colorado.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:23):**  Not to mention about 40% of our sales  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:25):**  are in Chihuahua, Mexico.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:27):**  A little bit in South Africa, a little bit in Chile,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:29):**  a little bit in the country of Peru.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:33):**  But all that being said is,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:34):**  is one thing that Phil taught me was,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:37):**  we gotta have a little bit of variability.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:40):**  If we don't have variability, we can't.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:43):**  If we hone it down to where it just basically grows good  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:47):**  in our valley, it's not gonna do good in other parts.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:51):**  So we always look for a little bit of diversification,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:54):**  a little bit of diversity in plant habit.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:11:57):**  And every time, I'm telling y'all now  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:00):**  that I've been doing this 40 years,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:01):**  the one thing I know Phil was right on,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:03):**  every time I get it honed in too close to one type,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:08):**  it doesn't work.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:09):**  It'll work right there at home,  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:10):**  but it won't work somewhere else.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:12):**  But if we've got a little bit of diversity,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:14):**  and this is the fun part of open pollinating,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:17):**  one thing you're gonna get today when you leave,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:19):**  I think, I hope you know that I love what I do.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:22):**  And I gotta live to be 200 years old to finish all this.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:25):**  John, your farming operation has really shifted and changed  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:31):**  even in the short time that I've known you.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:35):**  Can you tell us a little bit  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:35):**  about your actual farming operation,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:37):**  your farming, your cultural management practices,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:40):**  how you seek to put things that you,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:41):**  the types of things that you seek to do  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:43):**  to produce really high quality seed  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:44):**  and how that has changed in the last decade?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:47):**  Very much so, John.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:48):**  And that's one reason I mentioned the Mexico time.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:12:51):**  As I knew early on that good fertility meant healthier seed.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:00):**  And I'm selling to growers that are direct seeding.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:02):**  Very few people transplant chili.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:04):**  They do, but as a whole, we're direct seeding  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:08):**  because in the Southwest, it's so brutal.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:11):**  We get hard spring winds.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:13):**  We get all kinds of difficult weather, freezes.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:17):**  Most people don't know chili will take  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:19):**  about a 27 or eight degree morning.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:22):**  As long as to your point, John,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:25):**  that seedling is really healthy.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:28):**  If it's not healthy, it won't take it.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:30):**  If it's healthy, it'll take it.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:32):**  So John, I knew early on, we needed healthy seed.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:37):**  So John has brought me to a much better place  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:41):**  and not just trying to brag on him  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:43):**  cause he brought me up stage here.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:45):**  But part of how we found each other  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:47):**  was I'm always looking for a better way,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:50):**  a better way to increase vigor and germination,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:55):**  all the things so that my growers  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:57):**  start with a better advantage.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:13:59):**  And I will tell you in cotton and chili,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:01):**  I don't know about this end of the world  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:04):**  and what you guys farm, but in the Southwest desert,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:07):**  you know what you're gonna make within the first month.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:10):**  And I know that sounds a little bit crazy,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:13):**  but if you don't get that seed off to a good start,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:15):**  guys, sometimes and ladies, sometimes  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:21):**  I've seen it take up to 30, 35 days  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:23):**  to get a seedling out of the ground.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:27):**  Anytime it takes that long, I can tell that grower,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:30):**  he's not gonna have a really, really good crop.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:33):**  He'll make chili, but he's not gonna make the best chili.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:37):**  On the other hand, if we get it out of the ground  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:40):**  in 10, 15 days, we're gonna make a crop.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:42):**  At least we've got a good chance.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:45):**  And I think that's a very interesting point  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:46):**  considering the fact that I've had conversations  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:49):**  with grain crops producers in the Midwest  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:53):**  the last number of years who are attempting  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:55):**  to germinate seed grain, corn, right out of the bag,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:14:59):**  taking it into the greenhouse in a greenhouse environment.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:01):**  And in an optimal greenhouse environment,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:03):**  it's taking 14 to 20 days to germinate.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:06):**  I think that's a problem for a corn seed.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:09):**  And that's, we have had such a substantial deterioration  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:14):**  of seed quality within the industry at large.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:17):**  And I'd love to hear a bit more about  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:19):**  what are some of the specific things that you're doing  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:20):**  to try to increase seed quality  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:21):**  to speed up that germination time?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:24):**  Well, John, to that point,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:27):**  some of the stuff you brought to us in the beginning,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:29):**  the N-Furrow, I can't think of the name  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:32):**  of some of those products,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:33):**  but the N-Furrow products that bounce it out of the ground.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:37):**  One of the sessions this morning, I believe,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:41):**  specifically talked about seed treatment.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:44):**  I think it was Gary Zimmer.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:45):**  And he talked about having healthy biology on your seed.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:49):**  And we have definitely found that biology on the seed  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:52):**  early on makes us a much better start.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:15:57):**  The first real thing we seen with AEA products  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:01):**  in the beginning was 10 days earlier fruiting.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:05):**  10 days, that's huge guys.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:08):**  And anytime you've got earliness,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:12):**  you've got better plant health every time.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:15):**  Ed, what are some of the personal moments,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:17):**  your own personal journey that brought you  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:20):**  to seeking to make a change in your farming operation?  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:23):**  Well, it's mental condition, John.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:25):**  You guys get my humor?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:29):**  And I'm a farmer, need head exam.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:33):**  Especially every year we have to go back to the bank,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:35):**  kind of go in there jittery.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:37):**  Well, it's gonna work next year.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:39):**  You know.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:41):**  He's got to where he says,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:42):**  ah, go on, you know, I know it'll work.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:44):**  But John, to your point, five and a half years ago,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:51):**  I had a pre-cancer situation in my esophagus.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:56):**  Sometimes I've wondered if it was from tasting  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:16:59):**  so many hot chilies,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:00):**  because part of our work is in heat.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:03):**  And we genetically altered capsaicin  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:06):**  on a couple of our varieties that we call it the mean heat.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:10):**  It's the in-hydros and dihydros.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:14):**  If you do the scoble testing on it,  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:15):**  it's very different and it attacks.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:17):**  I feel almost certain that's part of what caused my trouble.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:21):**  But at the end of the day,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:23):**  and by the way, I'm not the only breeder that I've talked to  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:27):**  that had health problems from tasting fruit  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:29):**  and doing certain things.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:30):**  It's kind of interesting.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:31):**  I've had several come through here  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:32):**  to say I got in trouble for a next year.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:34):**  Specifically from working with  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:35):**  genetically modified varieties.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:38):**  Well, in this case, it's just open pollinated.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:41):**  But it was the capsaicin, I think.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:46):**  I can't prove that, but I think it was  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:48):**  because David who worked with me  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:50):**  started having trouble as well.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:51):**  And so we decided, you know what?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:53):**  And you gotta understand we're tasting these things  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:56):**  till we can't taste anything.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:17:58):**  And capsaicin will then nerve anything.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:02):**  It does.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:04):**  And a lot of people talk about hot chili  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:06):**  and ah, da, da, da, da, you know what?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:08):**  I guarantee you, my tongue has experienced more hot chili  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:13):**  than we would ever wanna explain.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:15):**  So nevertheless, by the way, capsaicin is,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:20):**  that is a very big industry coming on  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:23):**  that can be used for local anesthesia.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:27):**  Y'all already know about the mace products  
**[0:18:30-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:30):**  and some of those.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:30):**  But capsaicin, the field is just beginning.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:35):**  And I'm telling you, 20 years from now,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:38):**  this field is gonna be used for a lot of good things.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:42):**  But back to the point.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:43):**  So I ate my esophagus up.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:47):**  Doctor says, you know, we really need to go in there  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:51):**  and see what the deal is.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:52):**  So they did what they call a fundal application on me.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:54):**  And I had a pre-cancerous situation.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:58):**  They took my stomach.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:18:59):**  They made me a new sphincter valve.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:03):**  And my health just declined, just steeply.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:07):**  And for the next three years, I just,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:10):**  at one point, I got to where I could hardly  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:12):**  get out of the house.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:13):**  I was so weak and I was so allergic to everything.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:16):**  I found a holistic doctor in Scottsdale,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:19):**  Doctor Rob Ellsworth.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:21):**  Rob started directing me.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:22):**  First we did food allergy tests.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:24):**  We did heavy metal tests.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:25):**  We went down the line.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:26):**  Guys, I'm telling you the truth.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:30):**  I could not spray my front yard with Roundup.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:34):**  Just a little bit and I would get sick.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:38):**  So as we searched this thing out.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:39):**  Lucky for you.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:40):**  What's that?  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:41):**  Lucky for you.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:42):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:43):**  Yeah, we started figuring it out.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:45):**  Hey, I have a personal investment in understanding health.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:51):**  I talked to Doctor Alvin here a little bit.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:54):**  And that's right, you told me not to call you Doctor Alvin.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:56):**  So Alvin, I'll just say you were right on  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:19:59):**  when we discussed this.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:00):**  But the point is, is I had to figure out my own body.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:07):**  I was deathly ill.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:09):**  And I got over the surgery.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:12):**  I got over all that.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:14):**  But a specialist, a friend of mine,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:15):**  a doctor that I work with in the Chile,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:20):**  Doctor Nog Caudale, interestingly enough from New Hampshire,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:24):**  Nog was working on de-stemming for Chile  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:26):**  because we need the de-stem Chile.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:28):**  And that's a whole other genetic pool of looking at  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:30):**  that'll take me a long time to go through.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:32):**  But I'll just mention it briefly.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:33):**  But Nog's wife is a specialist.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:36):**  And she told me, she works with gastric bypass surgeries  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:40):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:41):**  She said, Ed, your ability to digest B vitamins  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:46):**  is impaired extremely.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:49):**  That was the first key, John.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:52):**  Whoa, hold it.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:53):**  Something happened here.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:55):**  Just as sure as I'm sitting here, by God's grace,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:20:59):**  this thing sent me on a new trail.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:01):**  Started looking at different forms of vitamin B to digest.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:05):**  Started looking at my own farm.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:08):**  What am I doing?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:10):**  We had already started to go organic.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:13):**  And it took me today on my farm.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:16):**  We have 500 acres established as certified organic.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:21):**  The reason was my own health.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:24):**  And I realized, John, for the first time,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:27):**  I hit, you know, I'm gonna make a little confession here.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:30):**  Okay?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:31):**  I poo-pooed all this stuff about Roundup's bad  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:34):**  and all that, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:36):**  Till it made me sick.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:39):**  And then I said, whoa, hold it.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:41):**  There is something to this.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:43):**  And there is.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:44):**  And ironically, you know what it is for me?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:48):**  It's the carrier.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:50):**  It's the carrier in the Roundup.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:52):**  It's actually more toxic than the glyphosate itself.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:55):**  So you mentioned just now that you've been  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:21:59):**  in the transition to organic for a period of time.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:03):**  What inspired, well, you shared some of the things  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:06):**  that inspired you, but I know that in prior conversations,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:09):**  one of the things that you've mentioned is  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:11):**  one of your major reservations about going in the direction  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:13):**  of becoming an organically certified farm  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:15):**  was challenges with disease control.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:17):**  So tell us a little bit about diseases in Chile  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:19):**  and what's been happening.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:23):**  This is the challenging part.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:26):**  Diseases.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:27):**  And I was scared to death of it.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:29):**  For you folks that are in this end of the world,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:31):**  I'm sure you understand what Phytophthora capsicum is  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:33):**  if you've grown any squash or any soft vegetables like that.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:37):**  In the desert, most people find that,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:41):**  we've talked to doctors all over the world through this  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:44):**  and they're shocked.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:45):**  Well, you're in the desert.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:47):**  How could you have Phytophthora?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:48):**  How could you have bacteria spots,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:50):**  Xanthomonas vesicatoria?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:51):**  How could you have these things?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:53):**  They're all water related.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:56):**  Folks, when we get a rain, we get a real rain.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:22:59):**  We may not get a rain for a long time.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:01):**  A little bit to John's point in your talk there.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:04):**  We come up with,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:08):**  and the year before last in 2016 and 2017 both,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:14):**  a week apart ironically in July of both years,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:18):**  we got three and a quarter inches with hail  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:20):**  in about 45 minutes.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:22):**  We farm on a slope while the water moves  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:25):**  and so do Phytophthora spores.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:28):**  And Phytophthora spores,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:32):**  they disperse sporangios with the word sporaleids.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:35):**  Yeah, there you go.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:37):**  Some of these work too big for the farm boys.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:39):**  They just,  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:42):**  I like to describe it like a wheat fire.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:45):**  Anybody seen a wheat field burn?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:46):**  It goes across and the wind will direct where that fire goes.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:51):**  Well that's how Phytophthora spores move.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:53):**  And you get the right temperature,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:23:57):**  the right water, the live moisture,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:01):**  and the right wind and it will go.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:02):**  You can follow it across a chili field  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:05):**  just like you can a fire in a wheat field.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:08):**  And what it does, it destroys the fruit  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:10):**  and then eventually it gets to the roots  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:12):**  and kills the plant.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:13):**  Our first experience of that was 1985.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:18):**  And I had a beautiful crop that was doing really well.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:22):**  We were harvesting.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:23):**  I had watered, John, and in those days we were irrigating.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:28):**  We always water ahead so that the fruit's good  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:31):**  and fresh and hard.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:33):**  We were watering ahead and we got,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:36):**  it's the 23rd of August, 1985.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:39):**  And we get the storms off the coast.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:42):**  We're not really that far from the ocean as the crow flies,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:45):**  about 300 miles.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:47):**  Those storms start coming and it's not uncommon  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:49):**  for us to get a big rain and then it set in  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:53):**  and it set in just like it does in y'all's country  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:55):**  and it started raining in Dresden and just slow,  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:24:58):**  no sunshine, which is rare for the desert  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:01):**  but it happens every year, one time or another.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:05):**  And that Phytophthora went crazy.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:07):**  And I went from harvesting what in those days  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:09):**  with 17 tons of the acre, which was a super yield.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:11):**  In those days, and we'll talk about yield later,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:14):**  but we went from 17 tons to I skipped the next 15 acres.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:20):**  Skipped it.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:21):**  It was all gone.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:23):**  What little was there was so hard for the cannery  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:26):**  to sort through to work with that we just had to give it up.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:29):**  John, I was a young man with several children.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:33):**  I thought life was over.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:35):**  How in the world are we gonna make it through this?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:40):**  We just lost 15 acres.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:42):**  Well, in our business, 15 acres is a lot  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:45):**  because the inputs are high.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:46):**  Today we hit about 6,000 an acre in each acre.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:49):**  In those days, it wasn't quite that high  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:50):**  but my point is it's intense agriculture.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:53):**  John, I was just wilting.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:55):**  So to your point, we have battled Phytophthora for years.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:25:59):**  2010, 2011 consecutively lost half of 300 acres both years,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:06):**  represented a little over a million dollars of input.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:09):**  And when I say lost, I don't mean,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:12):**  yeah, we went in and harvested some.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:14):**  I'm telling you, out of 300 acres, 150 acres were gone.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:19):**  There was nothing to harvest.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:21):**  Even in our seed blocks, we were able to find a little bit  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:25):**  to continue our genetic work,  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:27):**  but only with lots and lots and lots of searching.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:30):**  You know how devastating Phytophthora can be.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:32):**  So when I found John, I found a little hole.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:37):**  I'd been on the biology track a little bit,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:42):**  better health, better soil health, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:46):**  But when we found John, we started having holes.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:49):**  I am organic today because of him.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:52):**  I'll tell anybody that.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:54):**  He helped us.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:26:56):**  Last year, in 2017, the only field  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:01):**  we completely lost to Phytophthora was,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:05):**  what do you think, guys?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:05):**  My conventional field.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:09):**  My organic field, did it have some Phytophthora?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:13):**  Yes, especially the draws where the water runs.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:16):**  But overall, it was pretty dang good.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:21):**  My conventional field, 2017, out of 30 acres,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:26):**  we probably harvested the equivalent of about four or five.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:30):**  Did I give you an idea the difference?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:32):**  That was using Ritamil, all the high-powered stuff.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:36):**  Now, this past year, I didn't have any conventional.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:40):**  My neighbors did.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:41):**  Some of the boys are out here in the audience.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:45):**  But I have found that soil health and John's program,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:50):**  we've got a better chance also on the bacteria spot thing.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:54):**  Let me cover that just a minute.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:27:56):**  Again, that's where I really had the most argument  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:00):**  from scientists, although university people say,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:03):**  well, you shouldn't have bacteria spot.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:06):**  You're a dry climate.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:08):**  Again, yeah, we're a dry climate.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:11):**  Do you know what happens to us in the spring, guys?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:14):**  It's not uncommon about the 10th of May,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:17):**  and along about the 18th of the 20th, about every 10 days,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:21):**  we get those cold fronts come down  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:23):**  and we get really voracious wind.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:26):**  Literally, one May, we had 110 mile an hour wind.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:33):**  You got Chile that big.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:35):**  You got sand moving.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:36):**  It opens places for infection.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:40):**  Bacteria spot vesicatoria is all over our desert, all over.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:45):**  There's all kinds of host plants, native to Arizona.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:49):**  So when that wind blows, those spores are in the sand  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:52):**  and it inoculates us.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:55):**  Does it get sick right then?  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:56):**  No, don't get sick right then.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:28:59):**  Give it a little bit of time.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:00):**  Give us some spring or some summer rain, and here it comes.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:05):**  And I have said for a long time, John,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:07):**  the one thing about phytophthora,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:08):**  I know where I got it, the bacteria spot.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:12):**  You don't know till it's really ravaged you.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:14):**  It just keeps coming and coming and coming.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:16):**  And finally, you can't set any fruit  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:18):**  and you've got this really sick plant  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:21):**  that you can't do anything with.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:22):**  And since we've been organic, have we whipped it completely?  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:25):**  No, I'm not gonna tell any big stories here.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:30):**  We still have it, but is it better?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:32):**  Yeah, we see quite a bit better.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:35):**  That is good.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:36):**  You mentioned a moment ago how yields have changed today  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:40):**  from where they were 30 years ago.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:41):**  I think this is a trend that we see with a lot of crops  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:43):**  is that as crops tend to become more developed  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:47):**  and farmers manage them more intensely,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:49):**  we begin tapping into a much greater part  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:52):**  of the genetic potential  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:53):**  that many of these seeds already have.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:56):**  How have yields shifted and changed  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:29:57):**  in the time that you've been doing breeding work?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:01):**  Thanks for going there  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:02):**  because that's the fun part of your story.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:04):**  The first thing that put us on the map  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:06):**  is if we were gonna spread the green chile industry,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:11):**  which is basically Hispanic Mexican food,  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:13):**  if we were gonna spread it to the north and the east,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:17):**  the other meat and potatoes people.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:19):**  Yellin' on the lag spot.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:21):**  So what was one key thing?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:23):**  It couldn't be hot.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:25):**  And chile was, I've got a smile here.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:29):**  Chile is very, the old 6-4 variety that was bred  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:34):**  from by Roy Nakiyama in New Mexico State University,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:37):**  great variety.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:39):**  But the old tradition was to keep your seed  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:44):**  and growers kept their seed year after year after year.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:46):**  Well, if you had one hot chile,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:48):**  pretty soon you had several hot chiles  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:50):**  and pretty soon you had a lot of hot chile.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:52):**  And it was very common that you would be eating  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:30:56):**  a can of chile and two or three of them would be mild  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:00):**  and then boom, one of them was really hot.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:02):**  And that's what we couldn't have.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:04):**  But Phil and I on the map  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:05):**  and the whole breeding thing to begin with,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:07):**  we were the first ones to stabilize heat.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:09):**  That was the first thing.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:11):**  And later, if you guys wanna come and discuss it with me,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:14):**  it's a fun story, but it's true.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:17):**  That's what put us on the map  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:19):**  was we were able to go to the canneries,  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:21):**  we had a better yield and better heat control.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:24):**  So originally when we started,  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:26):**  the average yield in green chile was seven to eight tons  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:29):**  across the board.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:32):**  The first year we released one of our varieties,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:34):**  which then was called Arizona 20.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:36):**  Arizona 20 jumped that average yield to 14 tons,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:40):**  like that first year.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:41):**  Wow, that got everybody's attention, almost double.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:46):**  Today, we're sitting at an average,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:48):**  and this is fun to tell.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:52):**  I got a grower, Gary Shifflett does a great job.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:55):**  Zach Penn, several boys there do a really great job  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:58):**  in New Mexico.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:31:59):**  It's not uncommon now for us to touch 35 to 40 tons,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:04):**  but average for the industry right now is 18 to 20.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:08):**  And I talked to one of the guys at the cannery  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:12):**  in Echeverria yesterday.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:14):**  And we're gonna start out with another variety  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:17):**  that is ours that the boys reach the 32 to 36 ton  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:24):**  with one pick.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:25):**  And oftentimes they multi-pick and reach much higher levels.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:29):**  So John, and now let me take off on a spin on that  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:32):**  and we'll bounce back and forth on it.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:36):**  So when we increased yield,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:38):**  one of the things I seen as a breeder,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:40):**  the limiting factor, the limiting factor  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:44):**  was the xylons and the flume.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:47):**  Nutrient transport, the nutrient transport pipeline.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:51):**  The school bus is what I call it.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:53):**  You don't have a school bus to get it there,  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:55):**  you can't get the kids to school, right?  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:32:58):**  And that transport system, perfect intro to that, John,  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:02):**  because that transport system is everything.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:04):**  So in breeding, we started, I went back  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:07):**  and I won't publicly say what I used  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:09):**  because all my competitors will try to put it  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:12):**  in their hybrids but we went to one plant  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:15):**  that I knew in an anem crop, in one year crop,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:19):**  would grow a stem about inch and a half,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:22):**  sometimes as large as inch and three quarters around.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:25):**  I knew that it had a better vascular system.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:28):**  I knew it had a bigger pipeline.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:30):**  So John, we crossed that with one of our chile.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:32):**  We crossed it and then started selecting.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:35):**  And to this day, we're still working  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:38):**  with many of those crosses  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:39):**  and that's where we got the better yield.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:41):**  Also, John, that is where I first,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:44):**  way back before we understood anything  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:46):**  like what you understand, by accident,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:51):**  the guy I was working with that was doing our sampling,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:54):**  we proved that boron in itself,  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:33:57):**  if we could raise boron levels,  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:00):**  we could raise calcium levels.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:02):**  If we raise calcium levels, we solved,  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:06):**  or maybe not solved, but certainly minimized  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:09):**  blossom and rot, all with just the application of boron.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:15):**  And all the Western handbooks, all the studies said  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:18):**  that too much boron would be deadly, right?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:22):**  Everybody knows that.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:24):**  I'm telling you, one time I had a pivot stop, John,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:28):**  and we were running boron and the pump didn't shut off.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:31):**  We pumped a whole tank of boron in one spot.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:34):**  And we watched it and we took samples from the outside in.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:37):**  The scientists mind of mine just won't let up on that.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:40):**  When we had fun, we took samples  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:42):**  the rest of the year from that.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:45):**  We didn't kill any chili.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:46):**  We stunted it a little bit.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:48):**  We had a little growth regulator out of it.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:50):**  It lowered it a little bit, but guess what?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:53):**  The calcium levels were better all the way across,  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:56):**  even with extreme boron rate.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:34:59):**  So, John, that was the beginning of,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:01):**  in fact, another accident that happened was  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:05):**  a grower down just below, west of Hermosillo, Sinaloa,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:11):**  or Sonora, he, same thing happened.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:15):**  He got way too much boron on a drip system on jalapeno.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:19):**  And that block of jalapeno was better than any of the rest.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:22):**  So, we all started.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:24):**  And then we started comparing with the lettuce borer.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:26):**  They used to grow and ship a lot of lettuce.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:28):**  Started comparing to the lettuce boys  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:30):**  in Salinas, California.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:33):**  We got to notice them the same thing.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:34):**  This was in the 80s, John.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:36):**  We got to notice them,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:37):**  that where the boron levels were higher in lettuce,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:40):**  the calcium levels were higher, and guess what?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:43):**  Better, healthier lettuce head.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:45):**  Something that's getting to be very well understood.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:47):**  One of the, I find your story about breeding  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:51):**  for vascular tissue, breeding for stem,  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:54):**  to be really revealing and intriguing,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:35:56):**  because one of the stories is that Bruce Tainio,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:00):**  who's now no longer with us, was a seed breeder  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:02):**  and geneticist before developing,  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:04):**  before founding Tainio Technology.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:07):**  And he developed some of the foundational wheat  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:11):**  and soybean endosperm and germplasm  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:14):**  that is still being used today as foundational seed stock,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:19):**  because he focused on developing varieties and genetics  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:24):**  that developed really large and aggressive root systems  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:27):**  that still to this day have not been exceeded  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:30):**  in the work that he did 30, 40 years ago,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:33):**  which I find to be really intriguing.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:35):**  So within all of this, Ed, I'd love to ask you the question,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:38):**  what is something that you believe to be true  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:39):**  about agriculture that many other people  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:41):**  might perhaps not believe to be true?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:47):**  John, that's a good question from the standpoint  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:52):**  that the thing I see in agriculture is,  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:55):**  is the closer we get,  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:36:56):**  I spoke at a funeral on Saturday, this past Saturday.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:01):**  He was my neighbor, I rented his farmland,  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:03):**  and I told you on this story a while ago,  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:06):**  his son and I grew up together in a super family,  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:11):**  and his son, when I was talking to the family  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:14):**  about stories to share and stuff,  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:15):**  his son said, you know, dad held up  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:19):**  when I was very young in high school,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:21):**  he said he held up a handful of dirt,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:23):**  and he said, son, in this dirt lies all life.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:29):**  And I'm telling you, from where I sit,  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:31):**  and what I experienced with my own health,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:35):**  my own esophagus damage, okay,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:38):**  what I experienced is,  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:40):**  is that with all the chemical farming,  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:43):**  with all the things of what we thought we were doing right  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:48):**  when we started using commercial fertilizers,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:52):**  it's not healthy for the soul.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:37:58):**  And if we tear the soul down,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:01):**  first off, we're gonna have less fruit quality.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:05):**  I have watched with John's help,  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:10):**  and my neighbor Chad Cohen helping me do it,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:12):**  and his voice, by dedicatedly putting on my own son,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:16):**  Tyler Curry back there, and Keefen back there,  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:19):**  we've little by little, I can't tell you,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:23):**  I could go into a whole talk about cell density in fruit.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:29):**  David Cartmell found, one of my guys found,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:33):**  out of our single plant selection,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:35):**  a row that didn't go down when it froze, John.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:39):**  Everything else, the tissue was broke down.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:41):**  This row, it wasn't.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:43):**  That was genetics on that particular case,  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:45):**  and we've kept that line and we've worked on it.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:47):**  In fact, we're really proud of that line.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:50):**  But it's all about, the best way I can tell it  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:52):**  is in cell density and cell structure in a fruit.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:56):**  For you ladies, if you go to a store  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:38:58):**  and you buy an expensive Pima cotton sheet,  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:02):**  it's a thousand threads per square inch, right?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:04):**  That's a quality sheet.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:06):**  If you go to Walmart and you buy the cheapest thing you can,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:09):**  made in China, it'll be 300 threads per square inch, right?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:14):**  So vegetables are no different.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:17):**  The cell structure in a vegetable and the shell fly,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:22):**  in the industry they call it legs.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:24):**  It has legs if it has good shell fly.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:27):**  Well, number one, we found that genetically different  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:31):**  in that particular line and it still holds.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:33):**  But number two, John, is when we do it right,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:36):**  when we get the soil health right,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:38):**  that soil, when the soil's right,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:41):**  the fruit density is way better.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:43):**  And we find that just because we look at so many chilies.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:48):**  I cut chilies day after day after day.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:52):**  And we look at them and we study them  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:53):**  and we carry little magnifying glasses  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:56):**  and we do all kinds of things to see just the little things.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:39:59):**  And guys, I'm telling you, that's what's the fun part,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:02):**  is it's one thing to look at a set of genes  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:05):**  and look at alleles and look at DNA on a computer screen.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:09):**  But if you study the little things, it will talk to you.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:13):**  I need to carry this out and raise my own teenage son.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:16):**  I need to study the little things sometimes a little better.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:20):**  I apologize to him once in a while.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:22):**  Just like Brady, I haven't studied you quite enough.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:26):**  But I believe that in with what you're doing, John,  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:29):**  and the whole organic movement,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:32):**  but really let's forget the organic movement.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:35):**  Let's use regenerative as you use.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:37):**  I really like that word here at this conference.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:41):**  Because when we go to better health  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:45):**  in the soil, to the plant, to us,  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:49):**  we are gonna help our customers be healthier.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:53):**  That's the one thing.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:54):**  Do you all know that one chili, one chili,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:40:58):**  has over double the amount of vitamin C  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:01):**  that one orange does, over double.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:04):**  Then that's not counting vitamin A, D, E.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:07):**  When you go down those lines, chili is an amazing plant.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:13):**  Pepper is so diverse in so many ways.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:16):**  And I'm glad God made it that way.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:19):**  You know why?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:20):**  Because there's no gene shooting going on in chili.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:23):**  They've tried time after time after time,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:27):**  150, 200,000 shots in maybe one take,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:30):**  and then it won't take off.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:34):**  But that's okay.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:34):**  That's perfect.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:36):**  We'll do it better than okay.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:39):**  So Ed, what are you working on right now  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:43):**  that you're really excited about?  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:45):**  What do you still desire to experience on your farm?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:50):**  Probably the thing I'm most excited about  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:52):**  is our newer, higher yields.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:55):**  If we're gonna compete, our growers struggle  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:41:58):**  with Mexico right across the border.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:02):**  In the state of New Mexico,  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:05):**  everybody thinks that New Mexico  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:07):**  is being the kingpin of chili, and it is in the state.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:10):**  And they've done a great job of marketing that,  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:12):**  and I'm proud to be a part of it.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:16):**  But in New Mexico, right this day,  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:19):**  there's 7,000 acres of chili for canning purposes.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:24):**  In Mexico, in Chihuahua, the state bordering  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:28):**  Luna County in New Mexico, there is 92,000 acres.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:33):**  And then, if you go a little bit further  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:37):**  down into Zacatecas, which is the largest  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:39):**  pepper growing state in the world,  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:41):**  there's 250,000 acres, a quarter million.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:44):**  So when we look at what we've held onto in the state,  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:48):**  it's very little.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:49):**  So if I'm gonna hold onto my growers  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:52):**  and keep this industry in the state now,  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:54):**  we have got to give them higher yields.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:42:57):**  We have got to give them an advantage.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:00):**  And so the yields are number one.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:02):**  Disease control is number two,  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:04):**  and that's why I love working with you,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:05):**  is to help, I can take some of what you've given me,  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:08):**  the micro-5,000.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:10):**  I think that's a better product than anything out there  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:13):**  for folio, that kind of phytophthora.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:17):**  So John, higher yields, disease-resistant, flavor.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:21):**  Oh my goodness, I can't sit down about that.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:25):**  Use your microphone.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:27):**  I'm glad to get over excited, you know.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:31):**  There, now, all right.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:35):**  Flavor, I just gotta tell you all this standing up.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:38):**  How long do I have to open?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:41):**  Flavor, we've got a chili,  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:43):**  but when it turns red, we call it grandote.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:46):**  And grandote has a dark red cherry flavor.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:52):**  And then we've got the yellows.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:54):**  And this one's real exciting.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:43:56):**  But the yellow skies, not all tests, but one test showed  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:02):**  100 times the nutritional value of spinach.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:08):**  100 times.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:10):**  That means that you would have to eat 100 ounces of spinach  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:15):**  to one ounce of this yellow chili.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:19):**  We're gonna change the world.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:21):**  We're gonna help people be healthier, you know.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:23):**  That's exciting to me.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:25):**  You asked me what I'm, I'll sit back down,  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:27):**  but guys, I'm telling you, it's exciting.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:32):**  That's awesome.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:33):**  Thank you, Ed.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:35):**  There you go.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:42):**  So Ed, what is, you've had four decades of experience as a grower.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:47):**  What is advice that you would have for other growers?  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:51):**  And actually, I want to shift that question,  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:54):**  not so much for growers, but I think there is a strong desire  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:44:58):**  by many in the vegetable production space  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:01):**  to develop stronger stable genetics.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:04):**  What advice would you have for a young person  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:06):**  who wants to learn more about breeding  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:08):**  and developing their own varieties?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:10):**  Come to the farm.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:12):**  You might be inundated.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:14):**  I love teaching young people, Phil, who passed it to me.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:17):**  I have a high school degree, guys, like John.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:21):**  We didn't go to public universities.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:23):**  I lecture at universities now,  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:26):**  but I don't have a sheepskin, if you will.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:30):**  What resources would you recommend?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:34):**  You know, I like what I've heard here.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:37):**  I like what you do.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:39):**  John goes back to Luther Burbank.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:41):**  He's inspired me so much.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:42):**  I'm gonna go study Luther a little bit more.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:44):**  Some of the early information on plant health,  
**[0:45:48-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:48):**  you know, we took a wrong turn  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:51):**  and we forgot about soil health.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:53):**  So what did we forget about in breeding  
**[0:45:56-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:56):**  and what things, and I'm not saying,  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:45:59):**  I don't want to leave here saying that all science is bad  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:02):**  and that some of what some of my good friends  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:06):**  that work at New Mexico State and work at UC Davis  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:09):**  and work at the University of Arizona,  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:11):**  Dr. Rod Wing, Stephanie Walker,  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:14):**  I could just list several,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:16):**  but not all that molecular stuff's doing is bad,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:22):**  but coming back to that healthier rootstock,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:28):**  I liked what you said, healthier rootstock,  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:30):**  and so sources of that,  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:32):**  I liked your idea of going back and looking at history.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:35):**  History will teach us.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:36):**  What did they learn?  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:37):**  What did they know?  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:39):**  The Tierra Prieta question that I asked you just a while ago,  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:43):**  obviously that was some hundred years ago  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:45):**  or a thousand years ago.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:47):**  Somebody knew something about soil health, right?  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:51):**  So, you know, where to find some of that,  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:55):**  John, I'm probably at a stump of how to answer that.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:46:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:00):**  All right, I'd love to open the floor  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:03):**  to any questions from the audience.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:05):**  We, in a lot of the consulting work that I've done  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:10):**  around the world, there aren't very many people left  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:14):**  who have the base of knowledge and awareness  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:18):**  that Ed does on open pollinated seed breeding.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:21):**  It's not a common knowledge area,  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:23):**  and I think it's something that's very important  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:25):**  and very valuable for us to tap into.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:26):**  So I'd love to open it up for you in the audience  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:28):**  for any questions that you might have for Ed.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:34):**  Hi, Ed.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:35):**  You know, it's interesting when you're telling that story  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:37):**  about when you were a young man and you were given  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:40):**  that sort of Yoda-like trial to pick out, you know,  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:44):**  the hundred chilies, what immediately came to my mind  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:48):**  was Luther Burbank.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:49):**  Like, this just sounds like the story of Luther Burbank.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:52):**  So having this kind of perspective,  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:53):**  here's my question for you.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:55):**  Are you seeing a difference in the expression of genetics  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:47:59):**  when you have improved biology?  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:01):**  I assume you're seeing some improved biology in your field.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:03):**  And classically, in school in genetics,  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:05):**  we're taught that, you know,  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:07):**  abiotic stress creates more of an expression in genetics.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:10):**  And the more you stress something,  
**[0:48:12-0:48:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:12):**  the more you see genetic expression.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:14):**  But it's been my experience that the opposite's true.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:16):**  The more you see balance in the soil,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:19):**  the more you see expression in the genetics.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:21):**  You see better genetic change.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:23):**  Are you seeing that, and are you seeing a difference  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:26):**  in what you see in the genetics now  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:28):**  now that your soil microbiology is changing?  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:31):**  It's a bit young to say exactly what all I see there.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:35):**  Thank you for the question.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:36):**  It's a good question.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:38):**  But definitely, I strongly believe  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:42):**  that genetic expression, what turns genes on and off,  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:45):**  what makes certain things happen,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:50):**  there's a lot of, I think we've got a lot to learn there,  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:55):**  but the one thing I see for sure is the healthier we are,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:48:58):**  the better genetic expression we get.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:01):**  Now, to that question, can I throw something else in here?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:04):**  And that is the capsaicin in chili.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:08):**  People ask me all the time,  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:10):**  well, can you change how hot a chili is  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:12):**  by fertility, by water, whatever?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:15):**  And the answer is absolutely.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:19):**  Chili, the capsaicin is a protective mechanism in the pepper.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:25):**  That's all it is.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:27):**  And so when a pepper stresses, the capsaicin goes up,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:31):**  because in common terms, it thinks it better preserve itself.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:37):**  So the pepper's hotter, hotter nights,  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:41):**  any kind of stress, virus, whatever.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:43):**  So to your point, the healthier of the soil health we have  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:50):**  and the balance, I like what you said, balance.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:53):**  If we're at a balance, my friend and my good friend  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:57):**  and good grower, Gary Shifflett,  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:49:59):**  he's not organic, but his farm is balanced.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:03):**  He was recognized as the vegetable grower of the year  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:06):**  about 10 years ago nationally.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:08):**  He's an amazing farmer.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:11):**  Bill Cox does his work, and I'm telling you,  
**[0:50:13-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:13):**  you walk on Gary's farm and it's balanced, okay?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:16):**  It's balanced, and that's important.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:19):**  So to your answer, to your question,  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:21):**  the answer is yes.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:23):**  I firmly believe that we see different genetic expressions  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:27):**  through that, and the heat's the fun one to tell about,  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:30):**  because the healthier that is, and John,  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:33):**  to your point earlier in the day,  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:35):**  you were talking about water.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:36):**  I think you used it as the very first one  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:38):**  on the list you gave.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:40):**  So with pepper, you know, if you get to harvest  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:46):**  and you've got hotter chili than normal,  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:49):**  you either missed water or you missed something,  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:52):**  because it's going to tell you.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:54):**  Does that kind of answer it?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:55):**  Yes.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:56):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:57):**  Good question.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:50:58):**  Have you been keeping track of people  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:01):**  that use your method of breeding and other crops,  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:05):**  the I method, say corn, zucchini,  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:10):**  whether it's desert plants or in other regions,  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:14):**  they use the same method.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:15):**  Instead of the lab, they just breed by eye?  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:22):**  You know, sir, I really don't know a lot of breeders  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:27):**  anywhere that do it.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:29):**  There was a fellow in Hungary that did for the yellow bananas  
**[0:51:33-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:33):**  and the little yellow and red chili,  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:36):**  cherry peppers, the little round ones,  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:39):**  he did almost exactly what I'm doing.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:42):**  Sadly, he had a bad stroke and become completely impaired  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:48):**  and that whole seedlot was lost.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:52):**  That was a sad one.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:51:54):**  I did know him just vaguely and certainly he did very,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:00):**  very similar to what I do in other vegetables.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:03):**  I'm sorry to say I don't know hardly anybody.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:08):**  You guys want to hear a funny story along that line?  
**[0:52:13-0:52:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:13):**  I won't mention the company,  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:15):**  but I work with several different companies  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:18):**  and seed companies and talking to their corn breeders,  
**[0:52:22-0:52:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:22):**  the sweet corn breeders, it is so interesting what they look at  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:30):**  and how that whole thing works.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:34):**  I won't go into it now,  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:35):**  but, sir, I wish I did no more, but I don't.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:39):**  I think it's an opportunity for many young people  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:42):**  getting started.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:43):**  We badly need more.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:45):**  You know, one thing I can answer to your question, sir,  
**[0:52:49-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:49):**  is if we, big companies come to me to look for parent material,  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:52:58):**  even if they're going to do hybrids,  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:00):**  they've got to have parent material.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:02):**  They've got to have a set of genes to work with.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:04):**  You can't build the Lego set without the Legos, you know?  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:08):**  And so in answer to your question,  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:11):**  and John, to your point, many universities by and large  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:16):**  are not teaching the young ones what I do.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:21):**  And so even if we're going to continue in hybrids  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:24):**  and all the other work that's got to be done,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:27):**  somebody's still got to build the gene pool.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:29):**  And that's what we're doing, guys.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:31):**  That's the fun part.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:32):**  That's why I got all excited about telling you about the yellows,  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:34):**  is we're building gene pools.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:37):**  That's what we're doing.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:38):**  So in answer to your question and to your reply, John,  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:41):**  you're so right.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:42):**  For young ones, holy cow, I love encouraging them  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:45):**  to get into more of this.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:47):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:49):**  Hi.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:50):**  I'm very glad that both of you are here together talking about this,  
**[0:53:54-0:53:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:54):**  because I think there's an interaction there.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:53:56):**  And lately, for example, I know that John has been working  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:01):**  with citrus greening, you know, that problem.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:04):**  And there's banana problems.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:07):**  There's problems with coffee.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:10):**  So I'm not asking about breeding in general.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:13):**  I don't know much about it.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:15):**  But it seems to me like what we're trying to do is adapt to poorer  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:19):**  and poorer soil and environmental situations instead of  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:24):**  and the first thing we do is, oh, we need a new breed,  
**[0:54:29-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:29):**  or we need a new spray or something,  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:31):**  but it's not dealing directly with the health.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:34):**  Now, I'm wondering what happens when you were conventional.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:38):**  This question has been kind of bugging me.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:40):**  What happens when people breed?  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:42):**  Do they tend to breed so that you don't need the trace mineral  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:47):**  that might not be in the soil anymore?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:49):**  Is that what kind of happens?  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:51):**  Or are you actually trying to breed a stronger plant?  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:54:55):**  Or what kind of thinking goes into developing a new breed?  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:00):**  Because they're trying to do this with all these other plants right now  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:04):**  that are failing, and part of that is just a nutritional problem.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:08):**  But I don't know.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:10):**  What's it from a breed-to-breeders perspective?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:13):**  Well, I will tell you for sure, we have never, ever tried to breed something  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:17):**  that would do better with less fertility.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:22):**  I have tried to breed for drought tolerance, some things like that,  
**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:27):**  but if you were in John's class this morning,  
**[0:55:30-0:55:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:30):**  you talked a little bit about that and how, without water,  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:34):**  what stress induced and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:38):**  You know, sir, from where I sit, fertility is everything.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:43):**  And in my early years, pepper is one of the most hard,  
**[0:55:48-0:55:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:48):**  difficult crops to grow there is.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:51):**  You just name it and it gets a disease, it gets blossom-end-rod,  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:55):**  it just, pepper is a struggle.  
**[0:55:57-0:55:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:57):**  It's like sheep.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:55:59):**  It comes up to die and then it struggles from there on.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:02):**  And so if you grow a good crop of chili in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:07):**  you've done something.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:09):**  And so we've always tried to encourage our growers to top fertility.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:15):**  I've encouraged a lot of growers to call John.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:18):**  Once anyone teaches me something, if I think it'll help my grower, I do it.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:23):**  But you've got a good question, and that is, so what's going on breeding-wise to that?  
**[0:56:30-0:56:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/live-at-acres-2018-with-ed-curry/#t=0:56:30):**  And I tell you, no matter what we do, how horrible would it be if we bred something

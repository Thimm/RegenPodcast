**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which

**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:34):**  in terms of a dynamic that move us forward  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:37):**  in looking at agriculture  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:39):**  from an entirely different perspective,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:41):**  but also getting us to the point of  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:44):**  where does regenerative agriculture really pay us dividends  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:48):**  in terms of how we look to the future in agriculture?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:52):**  How do we look at the future  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:54):**  in terms of providing this nutritious food  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:58):**  for the whole world's population?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:00):**  You've mentioned a couple of pieces, Jerry,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:01):**  but let's focus on that.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:02):**  Can regenerative agriculture provide enough food  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:04):**  for a growing world population?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:06):**  I definitely think so.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:07):**  I think regenerative agriculture is the key  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:10):**  to food production and to food security.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:14):**  And I'll just break those apart for you.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:16):**  If we wanna think about increasing our production  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:18):**  on a unit of land, one of the key pieces in that  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:22):**  is how do we enhance our soil  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:25):**  so that we can have a greater productivity?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:27):**  But at the same time, how do we enhance our soil  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:31):**  and production system so that we are increasing  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:35):**  the nutritional quality of that food?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:38):**  And I think that becomes the key  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:40):**  in terms of how do we look at this system  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:43):**  from an entirely different perspective?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:47):**  And I think regenerative agriculture is the platform  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:51):**  that we need to think about going forward  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:53):**  in terms of being able to accomplish this,  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:56):**  not only within the US, but around the world.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:58):**  Jerry, just five years ago, or even less than that,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:01):**  the term regenerative agriculture  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:03):**  wasn't even in the mainstream lexicon.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:05):**  And I've been personally very surprised  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:08):**  by how rapidly it has gone mainstream  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:10):**  just in the last couple of years.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:12):**  How has that shift in lexicon  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:15):**  shifted the thinking and adoption?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:18):**  There's been discussions about sustainable agriculture  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:20):**  for quite some time, but how have actual practices  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:23):**  in the field changed and how can regenerative agriculture  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:26):**  deliver something for us that sustainable agriculture  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:28):**  wasn't able to?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, that's a really good question,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:31):**  but you go back and look at this.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:33):**  I mean, the whole aspect of sustainable agriculture,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:37):**  it was a viewpoint that, you know,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:42):**  we're gonna build agriculture for sustaining productions,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:45):**  distaining economics, then, you know,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:47):**  the National Academy put out the big report  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:49):**  on sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:52):**  But I think one of the failures in that  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:54):**  was it really didn't address how to get there  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:00):**  and to look at the components of the system.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:02):**  And when we talk about regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:06):**  it really is focused on the fact that  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:09):**  we've got to improve our soil resource  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:12):**  and here's the ways in which we can do that.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:15):**  Here's how that changing that soil benefits that plant.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:19):**  How does it in terms of productivity,  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:22):**  how does it benefit that ecosystem  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:25):**  in terms of improving not only production,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:29):**  but also environmental quality,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:31):**  all those different things.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:32):**  So I think it's really about the mindset  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:35):**  of how these pieces come together.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:37):**  But it really could be just as simple as the fact that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:40):**  sometimes it takes society a long time  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:43):**  and a certain level of maturity  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:45):**  to understand how these pieces really do fit together  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:48):**  and how it will benefit them  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:50):**  in terms of their production system.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:53):**  How's it gonna benefit them economically, societally,  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:56):**  and all these different things that go on this.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:58):**  And so it really has caught on  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:00):**  because I think people can begin to see the pathway forward  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:04):**  that people just kind of stood at the sidelines  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:07):**  in sustainable agriculture and say,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:08):**  well, yeah, it's a nice concept,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:10):**  but it doesn't have a roadmap.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:11):**  Regenerative agriculture is really supplying the roadmap  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:14):**  along with that.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:15):**  And I've made the comment in the past,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:17):**  why would we have any desire to sustain  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:20):**  our current levels of productivity  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:23):**  and all the externalized costs that we have?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:25):**  So one of the questions that comes to mind for me,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:28):**  when you think about the differences between sustainability  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:31):**  and regeneration in a local field,  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:35):**  how do those differences really play out  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:36):**  in terms of management and results?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:39):**  You know, that's a good question, John.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:41):**  I mean, and you're right.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:42):**  You hit on the target of saying,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:44):**  I always had an objection to calling it soil conservation  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:49):**  because in soil conservation,  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:51):**  you just conserve what you have.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:53):**  I always been pushing that,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:55):**  and even back 30 years ago,  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:57):**  when I first came here in the lab,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:58):**  I said, we need to be talking about soil enhancement.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:01):**  How do we improve our soils?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:03):**  How do we get more carbon into them?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:04):**  How do we get more water into them?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:06):**  How do we get better nutrient cycling?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:07):**  All these different things that go on.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:09):**  And so when you finally got to the point  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:13):**  of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:15):**  it was really a saying,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:17):**  we're gonna build it off of a soil base.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:20):**  We realized that soils are different within fields,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:24):**  that agricultural systems are gonna have different linkages  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:28):**  with the soils and the climate in which they're growing.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:31):**  And so I think we've begun to put it together  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:34):**  in a platform that says,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:38):**  here's a unique combination of soils.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:40):**  Here's a unique combination that has combinations  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:43):**  with what plants we grow there  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:45):**  and then the climate that's there.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:47):**  And we've been doing a lot lately on agroclimatic indices,  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:51):**  what plants will fit where  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:54):**  and get the most sustained production,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:57):**  but the least variable production over time.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:00):**  And when you come back to that picture,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:03):**  it always comes back to the soil and saying,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:06):**  if I wanna reduce my variation  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:08):**  and make the best expression of the climate that's there,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:13):**  I've gotta have that soil in a way  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:15):**  in which it is supplying water, nutrients,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:18):**  support to that plant,  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:20):**  all those different things that we now begin to know  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:25):**  how everything is linking together.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:27):**  And again, it comes back to this maybe level maturity  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:31):**  that we've reached in terms of being able  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:34):**  to understand some of these interactions.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:37):**  Science is really reticent  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:41):**  to dive into a lot of the interactions  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:44):**  that we know that go on within an individual field.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:47):**  We've got plants, we've got insects, we've got diseases,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:50):**  we've got soils, we've got weather.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:52):**  All of those are varying in time and space  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:55):**  and they're interacting together  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:57):**  in ways in which we can't comprehend at times.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:01):**  And then we try to quantify those  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:03):**  and we get even more mystified.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:05):**  And I think that now in regenerative ag,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:08):**  John, we're really admitting  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:10):**  that there are a lot of interactions  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:12):**  and that we are not afraid to begin to say  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:16):**  that as we change something in the soil,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:19):**  it's gonna have some impact on the plant  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:21):**  and it's going to have a different reaction  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:24):**  depending on what the weather is during the season.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:27):**  I think that's a key challenge that we have with the  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:31):**  scientific method and single factor analysis  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:34):**  is that agriculture doesn't lend itself  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:36):**  to single factor analysis very readily  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:39):**  or even multi-factorial analysis simply because  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:42):**  there's an almost unlimited number of factors.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:45):**  Yeah, that once makes it exciting.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:46):**  There's unlimited number of factors  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:51):**  and that, you know, I'll just use an example of this.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:55):**  I mean, rising CO2 levels are extremely beneficial  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:59):**  to plants, you know.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:02):**  Farmers love higher CO2, absolutely.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:05):**  Yeah, we love higher CO2.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:06):**  Check CO2 in the greenhouses all the time.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:09):**  But it was saying at the same time  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:12):**  as we increase temperatures  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:13):**  or make temperatures more variable  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:15):**  or you make precipitation more variable,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:17):**  we negate that CO2 effect.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:19):**  And so, you know, these interactions  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:22):**  between water availability, temperature dynamics  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:26):**  and this rising CO2 level are very critical  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:30):**  for us to look at.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:31):**  And, you know, I think that we're now mature enough  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:34):**  and I'll come back to that maturity word,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:36):**  mature enough to say, you know,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:38):**  we can't just look at one parameter alone.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:40):**  We have to look at all of these things as a system.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:44):**  Producers have been doing this  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:45):**  since they started cultivating.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:47):**  And I think that a lot of times  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:49):**  they're very frustrated with scientists  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:51):**  because we don't look at it  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:53):**  as that big system that they manage.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:55):**  We look at it as saying,  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:57):**  well, what did you change in terms of nitrogen?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:59):**  Or what did you change in terms of phosphorus?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:01):**  Or what was your row spacing or plant population?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:04):**  They go, it's all of those things.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:07):**  And I think this becomes where we really gonna have  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:10):**  to look at this and develop strategies of how we go forward.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:14):**  When I think about the differences  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:16):**  between sustainable agriculture  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:18):**  and regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:20):**  the approach that we've taken in our work  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:23):**  is that regenerative agriculture really is all about  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:28):**  helping plants get to peak photosynthesis,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:31):**  produce an abundance of carbohydrates  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:33):**  and move those carbohydrates into the soil  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:35):**  where you have a very functional carbon cycle working  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:40):**  and you're constantly accelerating plant health  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:43):**  and you're constantly accelerating soil health.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:45):**  And what I've realized when we think about  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:47):**  the entire soil plant system as an ecosystem,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:50):**  there's three, there's obviously, as you just said,  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:53):**  many different pieces and parts,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:55):**  but the drivers, you have photosynthesis,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:58):**  which is the way that you bring new energy  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:00):**  into the ecosystem.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:02):**  You have the soil biology,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:03):**  which processes that energy in the soil  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:05):**  and that total energy flow, that voltage, if you will,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:10):**  is reflected in the carbon cycle, the carbon exchange.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:13):**  And so the question that emerges from all of that  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:18):**  is how does the carbon cycle shift and change  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:22):**  when growers begin managing soils and crops differently  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:26):**  with regenerative management  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:28):**  rather than present mainstream management?  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah, I mean, it will kind of take this apart  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:34):**  and answer it in segments.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:37):**  And I'll just use our experiences that we have  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:41):**  in our own research that we have underway.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:43):**  And we do a lot of work in corn soybean systems  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:47):**  and over the past 17 years in looking at exchanges of carbon  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:53):**  between the plant and the atmosphere and the soil,  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:56):**  and even with soil analysis,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:59):**  we've shown that our typical corn soybean system,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:03):**  which is maybe a deep rip in the fall,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:06):**  field cultivation in the spring,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:07):**  the only thing we take off that land  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:09):**  is the grain of corn and soybeans,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:13):**  is that that carbon balance is losing a thousand pounds  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:18):**  of carbon per acre per year.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:20):**  Wow.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:20):**  You think about the average life of a producer,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:24):**  you know, farming 40 years,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:26):**  you know, they've lost 40,000 pounds of carbon  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:29):**  or 20 tons out of that.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:30):**  So it's a slow loss,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:33):**  but that slow loss is impacting their aggregate stability,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:40):**  it's impacting their soils.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:42):**  It's happening in such a slow way that they go,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:47):**  you know, where's my productivity gone on this field?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:52):**  It's different than it was before,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:54):**  but really don't come to the realization saying  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:56):**  it's the cumulative effect of what I've been doing  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:58):**  over my farming career.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:00):**  So, you know, that really becomes a dynamic  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:04):**  that we need to consider when we talk about,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:06):**  you know, why fields become variable over time.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:10):**  But on the other hand, we can change that system quickly.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:14):**  And I think this becomes the framework  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:18):**  that we need to be talking about is that  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:21):**  when we go to a system where we add cover crops  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:26):**  and we add or reduce the tillage intensity on that  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:30):**  by going to either strip till or no till,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:33):**  we've found that within one year,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:35):**  we can take that negative carbon balance  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:37):**  to a positive carbon balance.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:39):**  So now we've become to put more dividends from that plant,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:44):**  that capture of photosynthesis  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:46):**  and back into the biology that you talk about,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:49):**  putting that back into the soil.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:50):**  And so we go from this negative  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:52):**  to a positive carbon balance.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:54):**  In a single year.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:56):**  In a single year.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:57):**  And isn't that amazing?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:59):**  That is amazing.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:00):**  Yeah, even more amazing is that over a two year period,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:05):**  we doubled the microbial biomass  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:07):**  in the upper 12 inches of that profile.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:11):**  And these are not plots.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:12):**  These are 160 acre fields  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:15):**  and they're sampled at 150 foot grids.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:19):**  So there is a large number of samples  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:22):**  coming out of this 160 acres.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:24):**  And so we see that we've improved the biology  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:28):**  very, very quickly.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:30):**  And we've already begun to change  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:32):**  that upper surface of that soil.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:35):**  But I think one of the other pieces going on  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:37):**  and why the cover crops  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:39):**  and why the reduction in tillage is there  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:41):**  is that that cover crop is giving us a longer period of time  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:48):**  in which we're taking carbohydrate  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:50):**  or carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:53):**  converting it into carbohydrates  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:54):**  and then putting it back into the soil  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:57):**  in terms of feeding that soil biology.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:01):**  I always tell producers that biology wants four things.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:05):**  It wants food, water, air, and shelter.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:09):**  The basic necessities of life that you and I want.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:13):**  And if we start thinking about biology  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:15):**  from that perspective, they want a food source.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:19):**  And just like you and I, we like to eat every day.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:21):**  And so a lot of our systems  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:24):**  where we're only growing that crop during the summer,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:27):**  there's a long period of time  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:29):**  on either end of that growing season  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:31):**  in which we're not feeding them.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:32):**  They have to exist on what's there.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:34):**  And that's a pretty much a starvation diet.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:37):**  If we only ate three months out of the year,  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:39):**  we'd probably be fairly thin.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:42):**  We probably wouldn't be actually.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:44):**  Actually we probably wouldn't be.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:46):**  But we see those changes in the system.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:50):**  And when we start looking at cover crops,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:54):**  they're utilizing a lot of solar radiation  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:58):**  that if we don't have a crop growing there  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:01):**  is just going into the surface of the earth.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:04):**  And it really is at that point in time  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:06):**  it's not doing anything for us.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:08):**  And it's actually having a negative.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:09):**  It actually has a negative impact.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:12):**  I think the other piece of this, John,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:13):**  that we've seen what we're very excited about  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:17):**  is we have small experiments or small chambers  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:22):**  within the laboratory  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:24):**  in which we've been growing cover crops.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:28):**  And no cover crop, a monoculture oat,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:31):**  and then a cover crop cocktail  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:34):**  where we have an oat, a legume, and a brassica species.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:38):**  And we see that within one growing season  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:43):**  of that cover crop, we already changed the aggregates  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:47):**  in that upper soil surface.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:48):**  You mentioned that we influenced the carbon cycle.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:51):**  We're already seeing we changed the carbon cycle.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:53):**  Because in the cocktail, we see a much higher CO2 level,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:00):**  indicative of biological activity.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:02):**  We see a better oxygen content in there  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:06):**  because we've opened up the pores  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:09):**  so we get better oxygen exchange  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:10):**  between the soil and the atmosphere.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:12):**  We see that we've changed the aggregates.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:17):**  We're putting more carbon in there.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:19):**  After the first year, they're not very stable aggregates.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:23):**  They're already starting to form.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:24):**  The more fascinating thing  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:25):**  is that we took those cover crop experiments,  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:28):**  we terminated them just by cutting them off,  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:31):**  laying the residue back down on the ground,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:34):**  mimic a roller crimper system out there,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:37):**  and we put soybeans behind it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:39):**  And what we found is that we had an enhanced productivity  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:44):**  anytime we used a cover crop,  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:46):**  but we had even a more enhanced productivity  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:49):**  when we had the cocktail.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:50):**  More beans and a bigger bean on that.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:53):**  Now we went back after the soybeans,  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:56):**  we went back to that same cover crop cocktail,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:59):**  that same cover crop mix,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:01):**  grew that for the season, terminated it,  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:04):**  and have grain sorghum as our species  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:07):**  that is following that.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:09):**  We're seeing that the plants that are in the cocktail  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:13):**  are much greener because we've been running spad meters,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:16):**  looking at leaf chlorophyll content.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:18):**  They look like they have bigger heads on there  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:21):**  because they've just headed out this last week.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:24):**  And so now we're gonna harvest those in about another week  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:28):**  to capture all these different dynamics.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:30):**  But more importantly, the lower leaves on the cover crop  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:35):**  and then the cover crop cocktail have to remain green  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:38):**  while we had no cover crop,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:41):**  those leaves are already starting to dry up and snest.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:44):**  So it gets not only the carbon cycle out there,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:46):**  but I think it's influencing now the nutrient cycle  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:50):**  in terms of what's changing within that soil  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:52):**  that's supplying nutrients to that plant continuously  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:56):**  through the whole growing season.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:58):**  It's extremely fascinating to start looking at these things  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:01):**  and what's changing in our soils in a very rapid way.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:05):**  Jerry, you've mentioned a number of different pieces  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:08):**  that are exciting.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:09):**  And I just want to go back to a couple of points.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:11):**  One is when you spoke about growing in grow chambers,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:16):**  you mentioned that you saw increases  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:18):**  in both oxygen content as well as CO2.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:21):**  And this is something worth elaborating on  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:24):**  because I've observed the same thing in the field  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:27):**  on a field scale that when we have really healthy plants  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:29):**  that are photosynthesizing well,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:31):**  the interesting part, many people I think have this idea  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:34):**  that there is this conflict between CO2 concentrations  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:39):**  and oxygen concentrations.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:41):**  And I don't see it that way at all,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:42):**  that when we have higher CO2,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:44):**  I should say specifically when we have higher CO2  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:46):**  being released from the soil  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:48):**  and we have good photosynthesis,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:50):**  we get higher oxygen content in the air.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:52):**  That's correct.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:53):**  Which is?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:55):**  Which is counter to our thought process.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:57):**  And you only see that when you start measuring  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:01):**  both of those things simultaneously.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:03):**  I mean, I've been looking through the literature  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:05):**  on the number of papers that actually measure  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:09):**  oxygen content within the soil,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:10):**  even CO2 content within the soil.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:13):**  It's really pretty sparse.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:14):**  And it gets back to this aspect we talk about interactions  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:18):**  is that why are we concerned?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:22):**  To me, it's not a trade off between oxygen and CO2.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:25):**  What that's telling us is that we've got a biological system  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:29):**  that's generating CO2 in there  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:32):**  because they're working on this,  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:34):**  but now we've changed the soil with more pores,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:39):**  more structure to allow that gas exchange to occur  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:42):**  that keeps that oxygen content high  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:45):**  that then promotes more biological activity  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:48):**  that generates more CO2.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:50):**  And you really start looking at it from that process.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:53):**  You go, well, yes, they do have to behave that way.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:57):**  And so you look at all these different things  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:59):**  that are going on.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:00):**  I think it's quite fascinating from that standpoint.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:02):**  The reality is that soil and plant ecosystems  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:08):**  are they're really cyclical ecosystem  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:11):**  that are self-perpetuating  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:12):**  and they will self-perpetuate  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:14):**  either in a regenerative manner or a degenerative manner.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:16):**  And the only determining factor between those two  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:21):**  is the decisions that the farm manager makes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:24):**  Yep, that's why we use a concept  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:26):**  that I've talked to you about before  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:28):**  is genetics by environment by management.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:31):**  And I always explain to producers  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:33):**  that management is what they oversee  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:37):**  because environment is what they're trying to overcome  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:40):**  because genetics is what they're trying to optimize.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:42):**  So you think about G by E by M,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:44):**  genetics by environment by management.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:47):**  Management is what they oversee.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:50):**  I mean, they're the decisions that they make.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:52):**  The environment is what they're trying to overcome.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:55):**  That could be soil environment,  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:56):**  could be weather environment  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:58):**  because genetics is what they're trying to optimize.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:01):**  You really want to take a look at that genetic material  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:04):**  and say, what can I do to get the most out  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:07):**  of that genetic potential of that crop?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:09):**  What role did my management practices play  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:13):**  in allowing that genetics to be optimized?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:16):**  And then look at the soil as what's holding them back.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:19):**  So when we look at management by environment  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:22):**  and the soil as what is holding them back,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:25):**  one of the pieces that you mentioned earlier  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:28):**  was as you increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:31):**  you have greater climactic instability  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:34):**  and more climactic extremes,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:37):**  precipitation events, et cetera.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:38):**  How do we build greater climate resilience  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:43):**  into our ecosystems?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:44):**  It's really one of the things that builds climate resilience  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:49):**  is water availability.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:52):**  We see water is probably the limitation  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:54):**  to biological activity,  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:56):**  whether it be you, microbes, plants.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:00):**  I mean, water, in addition to oxygen for us,  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:04):**  is one of our real life bloods.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:06):**  And if you think about an agricultural ecosystem,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:11):**  it's really about having water available  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:14):**  to promote the biological activity.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:16):**  I mean, water stressed plants don't photosynthesize  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:20):**  very effectively or much at all,  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:23):**  even though they may have plenty of sunlight,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:25):**  they may have the right temperatures,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:26):**  but if we don't have water,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:28):**  they're just not gonna grow.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:30):**  And when we start thinking about resilience  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:33):**  within that system,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:34):**  it's really about how do we manage our soils  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:38):**  to make sure that that water availability  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:42):**  is at an optimum for plants.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:45):**  And if you look at this,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:46):**  and you go back to our discussion about CO2  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:51):**  and oxygen behavior within that soil,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:53):**  those same pores that are allowing oxygen  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:56):**  to get down into that soil  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:58):**  are the same pores in which we're moving water  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:01):**  from any irrigation event or rainfall event  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:06):**  down into that soil.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:08):**  I always tell producers,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:10):**  that's not how much rain you get in the rain gauge,  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:12):**  it's how much rain you get into the soil.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:15):**  You know, you think about that,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:17):**  I mean, if we're protecting that soil surface  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:19):**  and we've got all those pores open,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:22):**  you know, we can infiltrate a great deal of water.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:25):**  And the more we can make that aggregate stable,  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:30):**  the less the forces of water begin to disrupt it.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:34):**  And so we can maintain those channels  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:37):**  for longer periods of time or almost forever  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:40):**  in terms of moving water within that.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:42):**  Because once I can get water into the soil,  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:46):**  I can store water.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:48):**  But if I had my soil surfaces in such a way  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:50):**  that I've got runoff, I'm not storing any water.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:53):**  I might have an inch of rainfall,  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:55):**  but if I only get a half inch in the profile,  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:57):**  I only have a half inch of rainfall.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:59):**  I think farmers need to start looking at it  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:01):**  from that perspective and saying,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:03):**  is my soil capable of capturing the rainfall events  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:08):**  that are occurring out there?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:09):**  Because you talk about the climate disruption.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:12):**  One of the things that we're seeing is that  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:15):**  we're shifting our rainfall patterns.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:18):**  You know, we're getting more spring rainfall,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:20):**  we're getting more variable summer rainfall,  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:23):**  but in a lesser amount.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:25):**  And those storms are becoming more intense,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:28):**  they're becoming less frequent.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:30):**  Says that if we want agriculture to be efficient  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:34):**  and resilient in the long run,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:37):**  is we've got to make sure that it has  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:39):**  an adequate water supply for that crop.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:41):**  I think there's a second aspect to what you're describing  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:43):**  is not only making certain that the soil can store water,  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:48):**  can infiltrate and store it, but then also release it,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:51):**  which is I think an unappreciated quality  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:54):**  or good soil aggregate structure.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:56):**  Because what I've learned is that you can have  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:59):**  some clay soil types, which adsorb water  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:03):**  so tightly to the clay colloids,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:06):**  you can actually have no available water  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:09):**  for plants to absorb at 70% of the field capacity  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:12):**  when you don't have aggregates.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:14):**  You know, that's a good point.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:16):**  I mean, it really, and this goes back to, you know,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:19):**  the different soils that are out there,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:21):**  is that we want those, that soil not only to hold that water  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:25):**  but we want it to release that water back to the plant.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:29):**  If you look at this, one of the things I've been fascinated  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:32):**  by in looking at soils that have been improving over time,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:37):**  that, you know, they're changing their aggregate structure,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:40):**  they've got organic matter around the sides  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:42):**  of those aggregates that's really very dynamic  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:46):**  in terms of absorbing water and releasing water,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:49):**  is that when you start looking at how roots  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:51):**  are interacting with those aggregates,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:54):**  you find out that root may be growing along there  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:58):**  but the root hairs and even the mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:02):**  just form a web around that aggregate  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:06):**  in terms of taking advantage of all the little poor spaces  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:10):**  in which water and nutrients can be stored.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:13):**  And I think that becomes a real key  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:16):**  to how we begin to look at changing soils  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:19):**  and this pathway towards resilience  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:22):**  relative to some of the weather variations  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:24):**  that are going on out there.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:25):**  In the field scale experiments that you're conducting  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:28):**  with growing cover crops on, if I understood correctly,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:32):**  formerly corn and soybean fields  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:33):**  where you're getting this carbon gain,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:36):**  I know this is a question that some will have  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:37):**  is what cover crops were you using  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:39):**  and what have you observed there  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:40):**  in terms of aggregate development and stability?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:43):**  That's just a simple annual rye cover crop  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:46):**  in that experiment.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:47):**  We haven't gotten to go to cocktails yet.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:49):**  That's my next adventure with them,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:52):**  to go to the cocktails.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:54):**  When we look at this, we see those changes  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:58):**  in the aggregate structure  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:00):**  and again, that upper inch of the profile.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:03):**  And people say, well, you're not really changing  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:05):**  that profile very much.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:06):**  Well, you think about the upper inch of that soil  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:10):**  is the gateway between the atmosphere and the soil.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:13):**  And so improving that upper inch really does pay dividends  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:18):**  and the more stable we can keep that  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:20):**  and the less we disturb that  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:22):**  so those aggregates can continue to grow and form,  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:26):**  the better off we'll be.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:28):**  So we see that dynamics changing all the time.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:33):**  I think we could change it even more  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:35):**  because going back to one of the comments  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:38):**  that you made earlier about photosynthesis  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:40):**  and the reaction with soil biology  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:43):**  is that nature loves diversity.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:45):**  You look at a natural ecosystem.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:48):**  Do you ever see a monoculture in a natural ecosystem?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:51):**  There's no such thing.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:53):**  There's no such thing.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:55):**  Why in agriculture do we think that monocultures  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:00):**  are the path that-  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:03):**  Oh, because they're easy.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:04):**  They're easy, exactly.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:08):**  But if you look at this, every plant puts off  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:13):**  and gives off a different set of exudates  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:16):**  that are from the root into that soil  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:19):**  and that's what the biology is feasting on out there.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:22):**  And I think why we see these increases in CO2 levels  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:28):**  when we go to that cover crop cocktail  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:30):**  is that we've just enriched the diet,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:35):**  quote around diet, that's feeding that soil biology.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:39):**  And so we create a more diverse biological system  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:43):**  within the soil.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:45):**  And all of those are playing against each other  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:48):**  and they're complimenting each other.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:51):**  We understand so little about soil biology.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:54):**  It's really probably the biggest frontier we have  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:58):**  in terms of agriculture is to begin to understand  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:02):**  what changes our soil biological system  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:06):**  and how do we maintain and increase  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:08):**  that soil biological system.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:11):**  We understand the principles.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:12):**  They want food, water, air, and shelter,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:16):**  but how do those things interact  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:19):**  that shift different bacterial species  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:23):**  or the role that they play in mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:26):**  or the role that they just play in fungi in general  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:28):**  or all the other things that go on within that soil  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:33):**  because we just can't see into it very well.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:37):**  And because we can't see into it very well,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:39):**  we struggle to understand how to value it.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:41):**  What really is the value of biology?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:44):**  And I think this is a particularly challenging question  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:47):**  in the context of agriculture  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:49):**  because our agricultural economics are screwed up.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:53):**  We have a general agribusiness ecosystem that has developed  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:57):**  where we have our crops generally  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:00):**  have really become commodities  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:02):**  and operating on very low margins  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:05):**  combined with the challenge  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:08):**  that we have historically externalized many of our costs.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:12):**  We have externalized the environmental pollution  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:15):**  that has been caused by some of the toxins and pesticides  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:19):**  that we've used, fertilizers, nitrates, and water, et cetera.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:22):**  So when we look at all of these factors  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:25):**  that play in from a macro perspective,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:28):**  what is the value of regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:32):**  What's the cost of it?  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:33):**  And what's the return?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:35):**  I've often given talks, John, which people ask  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:39):**  about the value of carbon and I tell them it's priceless,  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:41):**  but they don't want to accept that answer.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:44):**  But I think you've hit on something very well.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:48):**  And that's, I think we're at the point in agriculture  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:52):**  that we must move away from just talking about agriculture,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:59):**  but begin to think about agroecology.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:01):**  How does agriculture fit into the ecological system?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:07):**  And look at that value of different ecosystem services.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:12):**  What is the impact of agriculture on water quality,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:18):**  water quantity?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:19):**  What's the impact on the biological services  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:24):**  that we see within the soil?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:26):**  What's the impact on the biological activity  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:29):**  we see associated with that agricultural field?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:32):**  Pollinators, insects, get a number of different things  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:35):**  that go on from that perspective.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:37):**  How do we even look at that landscape  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:40):**  from a different perspective as well?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:43):**  So I think when we start looking at that context  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:47):**  of agriculture, then we can really become  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:51):**  to have a fruitful discussion about the value  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:55):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:56):**  Because if you look at the value of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:59):**  you just do that simple change in terms of looking  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:04):**  at improving carbon, but at the same time  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:07):**  as we improve carbon, we improve water.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:11):**  Same time we improve carbon and water,  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:13):**  we also improve nutrient cycling within that soil.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:17):**  And it's not only nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:20):**  it's all the micronutrients that are out there.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:24):**  You got all of those pieces that now become linked together.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:29):**  And you begin to look at that and say,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:32):**  those things pay me dividends.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:35):**  And say, how do these things fit together  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:39):**  from looking at the value of regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:43):**  And I'll just use one example and that's  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:46):**  if we take a silt loam soil and have 2% organic matter in it  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:51):**  and assume a five foot profile corn at middle of August  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:56):**  which is using water at its maximum rate  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:59):**  we see across the Midwest.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:01):**  We have about eight days of available water  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:05):**  if we got a full profile before that plant  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:08):**  begins to be stressed.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:09):**  That's not very much.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:11):**  That's not very much, but if you go to 4% organic matter  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:14):**  you got 13 days.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:15):**  So you got five more days of available water  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:18):**  that that plant is not stressed  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:21):**  and is gonna be performing at its optimum.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:24):**  The probability of getting a rainfall in a five day period  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:27):**  across the Midwest is still pretty good.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:30):**  My point is that here's one of the pieces that we'll see  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:35):**  just in terms of value relative to productivity.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:39):**  The other thing we see in that value of productivity  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:42):**  is that when we enhance that nutrient cycling  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:45):**  is that we have that greener plant.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:50):**  We have a more photosynthetically efficient plant  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:53):**  so that we actually are creating more carbohydrates  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:57):**  that go into that plant, not only for grain production  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:02):**  but also still continuing to feed that root system  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:05):**  down below so that it again is more effective all the time.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:08):**  To me, that's where our yield stability comes from  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:11):**  that variation among years when we begin to do these things  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:15):**  we see that we are less subjected  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:18):**  to this weather variation that's going on.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:21):**  These longer periods of time between rainfall events  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:27):**  we see that and I mean, producers see this all the time  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:30):**  in fields.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:31):**  I mean, you've got always parts of a field  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:33):**  that are low yielding.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:35):**  I always got parts of a field that are high yielding.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:38):**  And if you go back and look the high yielding parts  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:41):**  of that field are always the really good soils.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:44):**  The low yielding parts are always those really poor soils  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:49):**  that have low water availability,  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:51):**  have low nutrient availability.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:52):**  In essence, what you're describing, if I'm understanding  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:55):**  or hearing you correctly is we need to think about  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:58):**  the value and the costs, not just purely in terms of  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:02):**  return on the money that we're putting in  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:05):**  but also return on water, return on nutrients, et cetera.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:08):**  Yeah, and in fact, I spent a lot of time,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:13):**  not only on, you know, profitability is one piece  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:18):**  and you go back to this low and high yielding parts  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:21):**  of the field is how many producers change their inputs  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:25):**  between those two different parts of the field?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:27):**  Very few.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:28):**  Very few.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:29):**  I mean, and you can make one improvement in profitability  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:33):**  by reducing your inputs on the low yielding parts  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:36):**  of the field because here's the other piece of this puzzle  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:39):**  is that my contention is that probably  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:44):**  our water quality problems, and I know our sediment problems  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:47):**  are coming from these soils that are degraded  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:51):**  because they don't have any capacity to hold it.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:54):**  Water moves through them either because they don't have  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:57):**  the water holding capacity, we either leach through them  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:59):**  or we don't have the water holding capacity  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:01):**  until we get runoff from them.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:02):**  You know, so I think we can improve our water quality  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:06):**  just very simple dynamic of saying don't put as much  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:09):**  on these low yielding parts because you're not gonna  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:11):**  get a return on it.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:12):**  The other thing is that I've spent a lot of time now  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:15):**  looking at water use efficiency.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:18):**  How much crop do we get per unit of water used by that crop?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:22):**  And you'll find out that those low yielding parts  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:25):**  of the field will invest a lot of water  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:28):**  into growing that plant, but when it comes  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:32):**  to the grain filling part, they're water limited,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:36):**  they're water stressed, so even though we had  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:39):**  great harvest potential, we don't realize that  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:42):**  because we, it basically goes under stress,  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:46):**  goes under early senescence, so we don't capture  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:49):**  that sunlight as well.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:50):**  So we also see in that part of the field  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:52):**  a very low radiation use efficiency  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:55):**  because we've invested radiation into that crop,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:58):**  but we haven't got any return on it  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:00):**  in terms of grain yield that we want.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:02):**  When you start explaining these dynamics to producers,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:08):**  not only are we talking about profitability,  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:09):**  but now we're talking about what sort of return  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:13):**  are you getting for every unit of nitrogen you apply,  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:16):**  and you have to couple that with water,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:17):**  and you have to couple that with light,  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:19):**  and they begin to see that here's the dynamics  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:23):**  of systems in terms of utilizing their natural resources,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:27):**  but also flipping it back and saying,  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:29):**  what are we losing out of that system  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:31):**  when we don't capture it?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:32):**  What are we losing in terms of nutrients  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:35):**  that impact water quality?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:36):**  What are we doing in terms of any of the chemicals  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:39):**  that we put on?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:40):**  Because we haven't utilized those effectively.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:44):**  And it just tried to open up a different dialogue  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:46):**  with producers.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:48):**  Jerry, I have an important question.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:50):**  How often are nutrients, specifically nitrogen,  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:55):**  phosphorus, and potassium, a limiting factor  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:57):**  in that equation?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:59):**  When you consider water and radiation,  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:02):**  all the various components that you were describing,  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:04):**  how often is nitrogen a limiting factor?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:06):**  Rarely.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:08):**  If you want to be honest about it,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:09):**  nitrogen is rarely our limiting factor,  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:12):**  although we put most of our importance on nitrogen.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:15):**  In my experience,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:16):**  I think I could safely say the word never.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:20):**  I've never seen nitrogen be a limiting factor  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:22):**  because it's the one thing that growers surplus apply  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:25):**  all the time.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:27):**  See, as a scientist, I never used the word never.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:29):**  You know?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:29):**  But you're right.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:33):**  I mean, rarely do we see,  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:36):**  and it could probably be in that never category,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:39):**  that nitrogen is not our limiting parameter.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:41):**  We always make it that way.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:44):**  And we think about it that way,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:45):**  but it's never the limiting factor that's out there.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:49):**  I mean, I just use another example for you  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:52):**  and trying to get producers to realize this,  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:55):**  that how they're managing their soil  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:58):**  and managing their water.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:59):**  If we look at high water tables early in the season  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:03):**  and this shifting rainfall pattern  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:05):**  where we have more spring precipitation,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:07):**  and we don't have that soil in a condition  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:10):**  that allows a drainage through that,  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:13):**  or the aggregate structure to allow the oxygen within that,  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:17):**  our root system may be limited  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:19):**  to the upper two feet of that soil profile  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:22):**  because that's all the deeper the plant's gonna grow.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:26):**  And then when we get into the grain filling period,  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:29):**  we can do this shift from adequate rainfall  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:33):**  to less than adequate rainfall.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:35):**  The plant at that stage is no longer going to grow any roots.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:38):**  And so we actually have a two foot profile  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:42):**  in which that plant has to exist,  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:44):**  not a whole five foot profile  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:46):**  that the plant could potentially use.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:48):**  And so we see that is a water limitation to that plant.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:53):**  I've often made the statement that water trumps nitrogen.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:57):**  That's not always the most popular statement to make  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:01):**  because people don't wanna realize  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:04):**  that water drives a lot of this process  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:09):**  and is the factor that really is influencing productivity  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:14):**  more than nutrients out there.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:17):**  Jerry, we're talking about a complex ecosystem  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:21):**  with lots of nutrients.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:22):**  And with lots of moving pieces and parts  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:25):**  in terms of climactic inputs, soils, et cetera.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:29):**  I'm a farmer in Iowa.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:31):**  Where are the trigger points?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:32):**  What are the pieces that I can influence  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:35):**  with the least amount of input  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:37):**  that will have the greatest productive changes  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:41):**  to the total ecosystem?  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:42):**  Two things.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:44):**  One is you have to reduce your tillage intensity  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:47):**  because anytime we stir that soil with tillage  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:50):**  is that we're releasing carbon  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:52):**  and we're allowing those aggregates to be exposed.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:57):**  We just see puffs of CO2 coming out of the soil.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:00):**  So we really disturb that soil in such a way.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:04):**  So if we reduce our tillage, it's one piece.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:07):**  The other piece is you can go one or two ways.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:10):**  You can diversify your rotations and say,  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:14):**  well, I'm going to look at the diversity of rotation  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:17):**  that's out there, looking at saying,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:18):**  all right, do I add a third crop into my corn soybean system?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:22):**  I can still keep a monoculture within that field,  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:25):**  but I'm just spreading out that it's rotation  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:27):**  or putting even hay alfalfa into that.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:30):**  Or I can go to that corn soybean system  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:34):**  and figure out how to efficiently add a cover crop.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:38):**  And one of the very fascinating things across Iowa,  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:41):**  when we looked at how much sunlight was available  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:45):**  to grow that cover crop,  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:47):**  just assuming from say black layer on corn  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:50):**  or total leaf drop on soybeans,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:52):**  from that point in time until the first frost,  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:56):**  and then from the last frost  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:58):**  until we had a emergent corn or soybean crop,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:04):**  is that we found out that we have about a third  
**[0:46:08-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:08):**  of our solar radiation that we get through the whole year  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:12):**  is available within those two time periods.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:13):**  So we have a lot of solar radiation  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:16):**  available to grow plant material  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:19):**  and put it back into that carbohydrates in the soil  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:23):**  and the soil biology.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:25):**  And so for producers in Iowa,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:28):**  it's really quite simple in my opinion.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:30):**  One is let's figure out how to capture more carbon  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:35):**  out of your cropping system to put it into  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:38):**  not only something that you want to harvest  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:40):**  and put it into that soil biology.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:42):**  The other one is to begin to reduce the tillage.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:45):**  I'm a big fan of strip till  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:48):**  just because a lot of people don't want to know till.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:51):**  Strip till is just a form  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:53):**  where we only disturbing that small amount of soil  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:56):**  in which we're putting our seed or fertilizer  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:59):**  or manure down into that system.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:01):**  Farmers have shown that there's big advantages to that  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:05):**  in terms of improving their soil carbon,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:08):**  improving their stands,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:10):**  all those different things that we've seen  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:12):**  in terms of research as well.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:14):**  And they've seen on their own farms.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:17):**  So I really believe that we can change this.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:22):**  I mean, we've seen advances in cover crop area  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:25):**  across the state.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:27):**  We haven't seen as much advanced  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:29):**  in terms of reducing tillage intensity,  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:33):**  but I think that here becomes our challenge, John,  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:35):**  is how do we effectively manage a cover crop  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:41):**  as part of this system?  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:43):**  And then the other one that we have to address  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:45):**  is what is the potential for an economic return  
**[0:47:50-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:50):**  of a third crop?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:51):**  I mean, if you look at what's the value  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:54):**  of putting wheat in that rotation,  
**[0:47:56-0:47:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:56):**  farmers will say, I don't have a market for it.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:58):**  If we go to a rotation with alfalfa  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:01):**  and what's in my market for hay.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:03):**  I'm excited about the fact  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:05):**  that we're talking about industrial hemp coming back  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:08):**  and being approved in here.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:10):**  What can we do with industrial hemp  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:13):**  in terms of paper products,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:15):**  a renewable resource from that perspective?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:18):**  And how do we manage that?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:21):**  So I think that here's a lot of things  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:24):**  that we need to be thinking about,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:26):**  but there are a lot of nuggets  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:27):**  and the nuggets of gold that producers  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:33):**  who are doing these things have shown  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:36):**  that it works across different soils,  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:38):**  different climates within the state, across the Midwest.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:42):**  And so to me, they're the bright shining examples  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:45):**  that yes, we can make these changes  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:48):**  and it is profitable,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:50):**  but it requires some management into that aspect as well.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:53):**  It's no longer just a simple system,  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:55):**  but it requires management investment.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:58):**  Yeah, there is a greater degree  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:59):**  of management intensity for sure.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:01):**  And you raised a couple of questions  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:02):**  that we need to be thinking about  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:05):**  in terms of how to manage cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:07):**  And that leads me to what is the question  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:11):**  that growers should be asking?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:13):**  What's the question they should be thinking about?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:15):**  That's a really good question.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:19):**  What question should they be thinking about?  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:22):**  I think a lot of this, if you go back to cover crops,  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:24):**  is what's the optimum time to put that cover crop in?  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:29):**  I mean, a lot of disruption goes on in our system.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:33):**  2018 is a really good example of this.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:36):**  Very wet fall, hard time getting  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:39):**  that cover crop established just because we couldn't get in  
**[0:49:43-0:49:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:43):**  to the fields if they wanted to wait until after harvest.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:47):**  Contrasted that to 2017, really dry fall,  
**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:51):**  able to get in there, but we had no water  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:53):**  at the soil surface to germinate that crop.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:57):**  So all we did in a lot of cases was spread birdseed.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:00):**  The question I think for producers is how can you,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:05):**  within your management system, management capabilities,  
**[0:50:09-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:09):**  begin to look and say, what is the pathway  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:12):**  towards improving my soils?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:16):**  And work with those individually to say,  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:20):**  here's the options that you have in terms  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:24):**  of making these changes because we've shown you  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:29):**  that improving your soils is going to add resilience  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:34):**  into your system, that it's going to increase your efficiency  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:38):**  and use of your resources out there.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:42):**  And so the question is, for producers,  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:45):**  is really quite simple, is how do I do this?  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:48):**  And each one of them is going to be tailored.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:51):**  There'll be general principles with it,  
**[0:50:53-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:53):**  but each one is going to be tailored to their own system.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:56):**  Well, there you go, friends.  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:58):**  Thank you for listening.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:59):**  We spoke about a lot of different pieces  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:51:01):**  that I hope you find valuable and useful.

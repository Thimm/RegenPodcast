### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2019-44-11)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems  that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:30):**  and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together  in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission  to have these regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which  all other growing systems are compared.  To achieve this goal,  I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:01:34):**  that means that we do not have to sell ads  and we're not beholden to advertisers.  This gives me the freedom to host  anyone that brings value to the community  and to gift free promotional space to organizations  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:01:45):**  that help impact the regenerative agriculture movement.  You'll notice that this season  we're airing short messages from organizations  that are doing great work in the sphere  of regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:01:58):**  Part awareness spreading, part thank you,  part community impact service.  We realized that this show is a great platform  to offer a wide audience to folks that we want to support.  We hope that you'll check them out  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:02:10):**  and get involved and support them as well.  Hey, farmers, this is Elizabeth Whitlow  with the Regenerative Organic Alliance,  where we believe in farming like the world depends on it.  And we know you do too.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:02:23):**  And that's why we've developed  the Regenerative Organic Certification Program,  also known as the ROC.  This is a holistic practice-based agricultural certification  founded by visionaries from the Rodale Institute,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:02:36):**  Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's.  The ROC framework provides stepwise guidance  for farming and ranching operations  that produce food, cosmetics and fiber.  We believe that it is essential to farm in a way  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:02:51):**  that enriches rather than degrades the soil  and in a way that values the animals and workers.  Brands are already seeking to bring ROC products  into their supply chains.  And we invite you to join us on the journey to ROC.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:03:05):**  You can begin by downloading the ROC participant handbook.  It's available on our website at regenorganic.org.  Hi, friends, welcome back  to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast.  I'm very pleased and happy to have back Jerry Hatfield  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:03:22):**  who was with us last year.  Jerry is a good friend of mine  and we've communicated about various ideas in the field  and things continue to change and evolve.  Regenerative agriculture is becoming much more mainstream  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:03:35):**  than it was even three to four years ago.  And we have a rapid development of new ideas,  new technologies, new information,  and also a rediscovery of old information,  a lot of different pieces  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:03:48):**  that I'm looking forward to discussing.  So Jerry, very pleased to have you back.  You've been working a lot of things over the last year  since we've spoken.  What has been exciting for you?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:03:58):**  Oh, a lot of things have been exciting.  I get up every day, John, with excitement  in terms of these discoveries  about how we have to change our thinking in soil management.  How do we have to change our thinking  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:10):**  about how plants fit into this whole soil environment?  And my whole background, I've worked on this  soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.  And really, this last few years have just been eye-opening  in terms of understanding these dynamics  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:29):**  of how soil and plant and the atmosphere all come together  in terms of a dynamic that move us forward  in looking at agriculture  from an entirely different perspective,  but also getting us to the point of  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:04:44):**  where does regenerative agriculture really pay us dividends  in terms of how we look to the future in agriculture?  How do we look at the future  in terms of providing this nutritious food  for the whole world's population?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:00):**  You've mentioned a couple of pieces, Jerry,  but let's focus on that.  Can regenerative agriculture provide enough food  for a growing world population?  I definitely think so.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:07):**  I think regenerative agriculture is the key  to food production and to food security.  And I'll just break those apart for you.  If we wanna think about increasing our production  on a unit of land, one of the key pieces in that  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:22):**  is how do we enhance our soil  so that we can have a greater productivity?  But at the same time, how do we enhance our soil  and production system so that we are increasing  the nutritional quality of that food?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:38):**  And I think that becomes the key  in terms of how do we look at this system  from an entirely different perspective?  And I think regenerative agriculture is the platform  that we need to think about going forward  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:05:53):**  in terms of being able to accomplish this,  not only within the US, but around the world.  Jerry, just five years ago, or even less than that,  the term regenerative agriculture  wasn't even in the mainstream lexicon.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:05):**  And I've been personally very surprised  by how rapidly it has gone mainstream  just in the last couple of years.  How has that shift in lexicon  shifted the thinking and adoption?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:18):**  There's been discussions about sustainable agriculture  for quite some time, but how have actual practices  in the field changed and how can regenerative agriculture  deliver something for us that sustainable agriculture  wasn't able to?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, that's a really good question,  but you go back and look at this.  I mean, the whole aspect of sustainable agriculture,  it was a viewpoint that, you know,  we're gonna build agriculture for sustaining productions,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:06:45):**  distaining economics, then, you know,  the National Academy put out the big report  on sustainable agriculture.  But I think one of the failures in that  was it really didn't address how to get there  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:00):**  and to look at the components of the system.  And when we talk about regenerative agriculture,  it really is focused on the fact that  we've got to improve our soil resource  and here's the ways in which we can do that.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:15):**  Here's how that changing that soil benefits that plant.  How does it in terms of productivity,  how does it benefit that ecosystem  in terms of improving not only production,  but also environmental quality,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:31):**  all those different things.  So I think it's really about the mindset  of how these pieces come together.  But it really could be just as simple as the fact that  sometimes it takes society a long time  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:43):**  and a certain level of maturity  to understand how these pieces really do fit together  and how it will benefit them  in terms of their production system.  How's it gonna benefit them economically, societally,  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:07:56):**  and all these different things that go on this.  And so it really has caught on  because I think people can begin to see the pathway forward  that people just kind of stood at the sidelines  in sustainable agriculture and say,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:08):**  well, yeah, it's a nice concept,  but it doesn't have a roadmap.  Regenerative agriculture is really supplying the roadmap  along with that.  And I've made the comment in the past,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:17):**  why would we have any desire to sustain  our current levels of productivity  and all the externalized costs that we have?  So one of the questions that comes to mind for me,  when you think about the differences between sustainability  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:31):**  and regeneration in a local field,  how do those differences really play out  in terms of management and results?  You know, that's a good question, John.  I mean, and you're right.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:42):**  You hit on the target of saying,  I always had an objection to calling it soil conservation  because in soil conservation,  you just conserve what you have.  I always been pushing that,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:08:55):**  and even back 30 years ago,  when I first came here in the lab,  I said, we need to be talking about soil enhancement.  How do we improve our soils?  How do we get more carbon into them?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:04):**  How do we get more water into them?  How do we get better nutrient cycling?  All these different things that go on.  And so when you finally got to the point  of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:15):**  it was really a saying,  we're gonna build it off of a soil base.  We realized that soils are different within fields,  that agricultural systems are gonna have different linkages  with the soils and the climate in which they're growing.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:31):**  And so I think we've begun to put it together  in a platform that says,  here's a unique combination of soils.  Here's a unique combination that has combinations  with what plants we grow there  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:09:45):**  and then the climate that's there.  And we've been doing a lot lately on agroclimatic indices,  what plants will fit where  and get the most sustained production,  but the least variable production over time.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:00):**  And when you come back to that picture,  it always comes back to the soil and saying,  if I wanna reduce my variation  and make the best expression of the climate that's there,  I've gotta have that soil in a way  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:15):**  in which it is supplying water, nutrients,  support to that plant,  all those different things that we now begin to know  how everything is linking together.  And again, it comes back to this maybe level maturity  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:31):**  that we've reached in terms of being able  to understand some of these interactions.  Science is really reticent  to dive into a lot of the interactions  that we know that go on within an individual field.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:10:47):**  We've got plants, we've got insects, we've got diseases,  we've got soils, we've got weather.  All of those are varying in time and space  and they're interacting together  in ways in which we can't comprehend at times.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:01):**  And then we try to quantify those  and we get even more mystified.  And I think that now in regenerative ag,  John, we're really admitting  that there are a lot of interactions  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:12):**  and that we are not afraid to begin to say  that as we change something in the soil,  it's gonna have some impact on the plant  and it's going to have a different reaction  depending on what the weather is during the season.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:27):**  I think that's a key challenge that we have with the  scientific method and single factor analysis  is that agriculture doesn't lend itself  to single factor analysis very readily  or even multi-factorial analysis simply because  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:42):**  there's an almost unlimited number of factors.  Yeah, that once makes it exciting.  There's unlimited number of factors  and that, you know, I'll just use an example of this.  I mean, rising CO2 levels are extremely beneficial  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:11:59):**  to plants, you know.  Farmers love higher CO2, absolutely.  Yeah, we love higher CO2.  Check CO2 in the greenhouses all the time.  But it was saying at the same time  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:12):**  as we increase temperatures  or make temperatures more variable  or you make precipitation more variable,  we negate that CO2 effect.  And so, you know, these interactions  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:22):**  between water availability, temperature dynamics  and this rising CO2 level are very critical  for us to look at.  And, you know, I think that we're now mature enough  and I'll come back to that maturity word,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:36):**  mature enough to say, you know,  we can't just look at one parameter alone.  We have to look at all of these things as a system.  Producers have been doing this  since they started cultivating.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:47):**  And I think that a lot of times  they're very frustrated with scientists  because we don't look at it  as that big system that they manage.  We look at it as saying,  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:12:57):**  well, what did you change in terms of nitrogen?  Or what did you change in terms of phosphorus?  Or what was your row spacing or plant population?  They go, it's all of those things.  And I think this becomes where we really gonna have  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:10):**  to look at this and develop strategies of how we go forward.  When I think about the differences  between sustainable agriculture  and regenerative agriculture,  the approach that we've taken in our work  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:23):**  is that regenerative agriculture really is all about  helping plants get to peak photosynthesis,  produce an abundance of carbohydrates  and move those carbohydrates into the soil  where you have a very functional carbon cycle working  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:40):**  and you're constantly accelerating plant health  and you're constantly accelerating soil health.  And what I've realized when we think about  the entire soil plant system as an ecosystem,  there's three, there's obviously, as you just said,  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:13:53):**  many different pieces and parts,  but the drivers, you have photosynthesis,  which is the way that you bring new energy  into the ecosystem.  You have the soil biology,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:03):**  which processes that energy in the soil  and that total energy flow, that voltage, if you will,  is reflected in the carbon cycle, the carbon exchange.  And so the question that emerges from all of that  is how does the carbon cycle shift and change  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:22):**  when growers begin managing soils and crops differently  with regenerative management  rather than present mainstream management?  Yeah, I mean, it will kind of take this apart  and answer it in segments.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:37):**  And I'll just use our experiences that we have  in our own research that we have underway.  And we do a lot of work in corn soybean systems  and over the past 17 years in looking at exchanges of carbon  between the plant and the atmosphere and the soil,  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:14:56):**  and even with soil analysis,  we've shown that our typical corn soybean system,  which is maybe a deep rip in the fall,  field cultivation in the spring,  the only thing we take off that land  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:09):**  is the grain of corn and soybeans,  is that that carbon balance is losing a thousand pounds  of carbon per acre per year.  Wow.  You think about the average life of a producer,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:24):**  you know, farming 40 years,  you know, they've lost 40,000 pounds of carbon  or 20 tons out of that.  So it's a slow loss,  but that slow loss is impacting their aggregate stability,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:40):**  it's impacting their soils.  It's happening in such a slow way that they go,  you know, where's my productivity gone on this field?  It's different than it was before,  but really don't come to the realization saying  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:15:56):**  it's the cumulative effect of what I've been doing  over my farming career.  So, you know, that really becomes a dynamic  that we need to consider when we talk about,  you know, why fields become variable over time.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:10):**  But on the other hand, we can change that system quickly.  And I think this becomes the framework  that we need to be talking about is that  when we go to a system where we add cover crops  and we add or reduce the tillage intensity on that  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:30):**  by going to either strip till or no till,  we've found that within one year,  we can take that negative carbon balance  to a positive carbon balance.  So now we've become to put more dividends from that plant,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:44):**  that capture of photosynthesis  and back into the biology that you talk about,  putting that back into the soil.  And so we go from this negative  to a positive carbon balance.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:16:54):**  In a single year.  In a single year.  And isn't that amazing?  That is amazing.  Yeah, even more amazing is that over a two year period,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:05):**  we doubled the microbial biomass  in the upper 12 inches of that profile.  And these are not plots.  These are 160 acre fields  and they're sampled at 150 foot grids.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:19):**  So there is a large number of samples  coming out of this 160 acres.  And so we see that we've improved the biology  very, very quickly.  And we've already begun to change  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:32):**  that upper surface of that soil.  But I think one of the other pieces going on  and why the cover crops  and why the reduction in tillage is there  is that that cover crop is giving us a longer period of time  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:17:48):**  in which we're taking carbohydrate  or carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,  converting it into carbohydrates  and then putting it back into the soil  in terms of feeding that soil biology.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:01):**  I always tell producers that biology wants four things.  It wants food, water, air, and shelter.  The basic necessities of life that you and I want.  And if we start thinking about biology  from that perspective, they want a food source.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:19):**  And just like you and I, we like to eat every day.  And so a lot of our systems  where we're only growing that crop during the summer,  there's a long period of time  on either end of that growing season  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:31):**  in which we're not feeding them.  They have to exist on what's there.  And that's a pretty much a starvation diet.  If we only ate three months out of the year,  we'd probably be fairly thin.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:42):**  We probably wouldn't be actually.  Actually we probably wouldn't be.  But we see those changes in the system.  And when we start looking at cover crops,  they're utilizing a lot of solar radiation  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:18:58):**  that if we don't have a crop growing there  is just going into the surface of the earth.  And it really is at that point in time  it's not doing anything for us.  And it's actually having a negative.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:09):**  It actually has a negative impact.  I think the other piece of this, John,  that we've seen what we're very excited about  is we have small experiments or small chambers  within the laboratory  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:24):**  in which we've been growing cover crops.  And no cover crop, a monoculture oat,  and then a cover crop cocktail  where we have an oat, a legume, and a brassica species.  And we see that within one growing season  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:19:43):**  of that cover crop, we already changed the aggregates  in that upper soil surface.  You mentioned that we influenced the carbon cycle.  We're already seeing we changed the carbon cycle.  Because in the cocktail, we see a much higher CO2 level,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:00):**  indicative of biological activity.  We see a better oxygen content in there  because we've opened up the pores  so we get better oxygen exchange  between the soil and the atmosphere.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:12):**  We see that we've changed the aggregates.  We're putting more carbon in there.  After the first year, they're not very stable aggregates.  They're already starting to form.  The more fascinating thing  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:25):**  is that we took those cover crop experiments,  we terminated them just by cutting them off,  laying the residue back down on the ground,  mimic a roller crimper system out there,  and we put soybeans behind it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:39):**  And what we found is that we had an enhanced productivity  anytime we used a cover crop,  but we had even a more enhanced productivity  when we had the cocktail.  More beans and a bigger bean on that.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:20:53):**  Now we went back after the soybeans,  we went back to that same cover crop cocktail,  that same cover crop mix,  grew that for the season, terminated it,  and have grain sorghum as our species  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:07):**  that is following that.  We're seeing that the plants that are in the cocktail  are much greener because we've been running spad meters,  looking at leaf chlorophyll content.  They look like they have bigger heads on there  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:21):**  because they've just headed out this last week.  And so now we're gonna harvest those in about another week  to capture all these different dynamics.  But more importantly, the lower leaves on the cover crop  and then the cover crop cocktail have to remain green  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:38):**  while we had no cover crop,  those leaves are already starting to dry up and snest.  So it gets not only the carbon cycle out there,  but I think it's influencing now the nutrient cycle  in terms of what's changing within that soil  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:21:52):**  that's supplying nutrients to that plant continuously  through the whole growing season.  It's extremely fascinating to start looking at these things  and what's changing in our soils in a very rapid way.  Jerry, you've mentioned a number of different pieces  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:08):**  that are exciting.  And I just want to go back to a couple of points.  One is when you spoke about growing in grow chambers,  you mentioned that you saw increases  in both oxygen content as well as CO2.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:21):**  And this is something worth elaborating on  because I've observed the same thing in the field  on a field scale that when we have really healthy plants  that are photosynthesizing well,  the interesting part, many people I think have this idea  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:34):**  that there is this conflict between CO2 concentrations  and oxygen concentrations.  And I don't see it that way at all,  that when we have higher CO2,  I should say specifically when we have higher CO2  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:46):**  being released from the soil  and we have good photosynthesis,  we get higher oxygen content in the air.  That's correct.  Which is?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:22:55):**  Which is counter to our thought process.  And you only see that when you start measuring  both of those things simultaneously.  I mean, I've been looking through the literature  on the number of papers that actually measure  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:09):**  oxygen content within the soil,  even CO2 content within the soil.  It's really pretty sparse.  And it gets back to this aspect we talk about interactions  is that why are we concerned?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:22):**  To me, it's not a trade off between oxygen and CO2.  What that's telling us is that we've got a biological system  that's generating CO2 in there  because they're working on this,  but now we've changed the soil with more pores,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:39):**  more structure to allow that gas exchange to occur  that keeps that oxygen content high  that then promotes more biological activity  that generates more CO2.  And you really start looking at it from that process.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:23:53):**  You go, well, yes, they do have to behave that way.  And so you look at all these different things  that are going on.  I think it's quite fascinating from that standpoint.  The reality is that soil and plant ecosystems  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:08):**  are they're really cyclical ecosystem  that are self-perpetuating  and they will self-perpetuate  either in a regenerative manner or a degenerative manner.  And the only determining factor between those two  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:21):**  is the decisions that the farm manager makes.  Yep, that's why we use a concept  that I've talked to you about before  is genetics by environment by management.  And I always explain to producers  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:33):**  that management is what they oversee  because environment is what they're trying to overcome  because genetics is what they're trying to optimize.  So you think about G by E by M,  genetics by environment by management.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:47):**  Management is what they oversee.  I mean, they're the decisions that they make.  The environment is what they're trying to overcome.  That could be soil environment,  could be weather environment  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:24:58):**  because genetics is what they're trying to optimize.  You really want to take a look at that genetic material  and say, what can I do to get the most out  of that genetic potential of that crop?  What role did my management practices play  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:13):**  in allowing that genetics to be optimized?  And then look at the soil as what's holding them back.  So when we look at management by environment  and the soil as what is holding them back,  one of the pieces that you mentioned earlier  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:28):**  was as you increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere,  you have greater climactic instability  and more climactic extremes,  precipitation events, et cetera.  How do we build greater climate resilience  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:43):**  into our ecosystems?  It's really one of the things that builds climate resilience  is water availability.  We see water is probably the limitation  to biological activity,  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:25:56):**  whether it be you, microbes, plants.  I mean, water, in addition to oxygen for us,  is one of our real life bloods.  And if you think about an agricultural ecosystem,  it's really about having water available  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:14):**  to promote the biological activity.  I mean, water stressed plants don't photosynthesize  very effectively or much at all,  even though they may have plenty of sunlight,  they may have the right temperatures,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:26):**  but if we don't have water,  they're just not gonna grow.  And when we start thinking about resilience  within that system,  it's really about how do we manage our soils  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:38):**  to make sure that that water availability  is at an optimum for plants.  And if you look at this,  and you go back to our discussion about CO2  and oxygen behavior within that soil,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:26:53):**  those same pores that are allowing oxygen  to get down into that soil  are the same pores in which we're moving water  from any irrigation event or rainfall event  down into that soil.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:08):**  I always tell producers,  that's not how much rain you get in the rain gauge,  it's how much rain you get into the soil.  You know, you think about that,  I mean, if we're protecting that soil surface  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:19):**  and we've got all those pores open,  you know, we can infiltrate a great deal of water.  And the more we can make that aggregate stable,  the less the forces of water begin to disrupt it.  And so we can maintain those channels  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:37):**  for longer periods of time or almost forever  in terms of moving water within that.  Because once I can get water into the soil,  I can store water.  But if I had my soil surfaces in such a way  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:27:50):**  that I've got runoff, I'm not storing any water.  I might have an inch of rainfall,  but if I only get a half inch in the profile,  I only have a half inch of rainfall.  I think farmers need to start looking at it  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:01):**  from that perspective and saying,  is my soil capable of capturing the rainfall events  that are occurring out there?  Because you talk about the climate disruption.  One of the things that we're seeing is that  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:15):**  we're shifting our rainfall patterns.  You know, we're getting more spring rainfall,  we're getting more variable summer rainfall,  but in a lesser amount.  And those storms are becoming more intense,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:28):**  they're becoming less frequent.  Says that if we want agriculture to be efficient  and resilient in the long run,  is we've got to make sure that it has  an adequate water supply for that crop.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:41):**  I think there's a second aspect to what you're describing  is not only making certain that the soil can store water,  can infiltrate and store it, but then also release it,  which is I think an unappreciated quality  or good soil aggregate structure.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:28:56):**  Because what I've learned is that you can have  some clay soil types, which adsorb water  so tightly to the clay colloids,  you can actually have no available water  for plants to absorb at 70% of the field capacity  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:12):**  when you don't have aggregates.  You know, that's a good point.  I mean, it really, and this goes back to, you know,  the different soils that are out there,  is that we want those, that soil not only to hold that water  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:25):**  but we want it to release that water back to the plant.  If you look at this, one of the things I've been fascinated  by in looking at soils that have been improving over time,  that, you know, they're changing their aggregate structure,  they've got organic matter around the sides  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:42):**  of those aggregates that's really very dynamic  in terms of absorbing water and releasing water,  is that when you start looking at how roots  are interacting with those aggregates,  you find out that root may be growing along there  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:29:58):**  but the root hairs and even the mycorrhizal fungi  just form a web around that aggregate  in terms of taking advantage of all the little poor spaces  in which water and nutrients can be stored.  And I think that becomes a real key  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:16):**  to how we begin to look at changing soils  and this pathway towards resilience  relative to some of the weather variations  that are going on out there.  In the field scale experiments that you're conducting  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:28):**  with growing cover crops on, if I understood correctly,  formerly corn and soybean fields  where you're getting this carbon gain,  I know this is a question that some will have  is what cover crops were you using  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:39):**  and what have you observed there  in terms of aggregate development and stability?  That's just a simple annual rye cover crop  in that experiment.  We haven't gotten to go to cocktails yet.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:30:49):**  That's my next adventure with them,  to go to the cocktails.  When we look at this, we see those changes  in the aggregate structure  and again, that upper inch of the profile.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:03):**  And people say, well, you're not really changing  that profile very much.  Well, you think about the upper inch of that soil  is the gateway between the atmosphere and the soil.  And so improving that upper inch really does pay dividends  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:18):**  and the more stable we can keep that  and the less we disturb that  so those aggregates can continue to grow and form,  the better off we'll be.  So we see that dynamics changing all the time.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:33):**  I think we could change it even more  because going back to one of the comments  that you made earlier about photosynthesis  and the reaction with soil biology  is that nature loves diversity.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:31:45):**  You look at a natural ecosystem.  Do you ever see a monoculture in a natural ecosystem?  There's no such thing.  There's no such thing.  Why in agriculture do we think that monocultures  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:00):**  are the path that-  Oh, because they're easy.  They're easy, exactly.  But if you look at this, every plant puts off  and gives off a different set of exudates  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:16):**  that are from the root into that soil  and that's what the biology is feasting on out there.  And I think why we see these increases in CO2 levels  when we go to that cover crop cocktail  is that we've just enriched the diet,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:35):**  quote around diet, that's feeding that soil biology.  And so we create a more diverse biological system  within the soil.  And all of those are playing against each other  and they're complimenting each other.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:32:51):**  We understand so little about soil biology.  It's really probably the biggest frontier we have  in terms of agriculture is to begin to understand  what changes our soil biological system  and how do we maintain and increase  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:08):**  that soil biological system.  We understand the principles.  They want food, water, air, and shelter,  but how do those things interact  that shift different bacterial species  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:23):**  or the role that they play in mycorrhizal fungi  or the role that they just play in fungi in general  or all the other things that go on within that soil  because we just can't see into it very well.  And because we can't see into it very well,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:39):**  we struggle to understand how to value it.  What really is the value of biology?  And I think this is a particularly challenging question  in the context of agriculture  because our agricultural economics are screwed up.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:33:53):**  We have a general agribusiness ecosystem that has developed  where we have our crops generally  have really become commodities  and operating on very low margins  combined with the challenge  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:08):**  that we have historically externalized many of our costs.  We have externalized the environmental pollution  that has been caused by some of the toxins and pesticides  that we've used, fertilizers, nitrates, and water, et cetera.  So when we look at all of these factors  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:25):**  that play in from a macro perspective,  what is the value of regenerative agriculture?  What's the cost of it?  And what's the return?  I've often given talks, John, which people ask  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:39):**  about the value of carbon and I tell them it's priceless,  but they don't want to accept that answer.  But I think you've hit on something very well.  And that's, I think we're at the point in agriculture  that we must move away from just talking about agriculture,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:34:59):**  but begin to think about agroecology.  How does agriculture fit into the ecological system?  And look at that value of different ecosystem services.  What is the impact of agriculture on water quality,  water quantity?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:19):**  What's the impact on the biological services  that we see within the soil?  What's the impact on the biological activity  we see associated with that agricultural field?  Pollinators, insects, get a number of different things  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:35):**  that go on from that perspective.  How do we even look at that landscape  from a different perspective as well?  So I think when we start looking at that context  of agriculture, then we can really become  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:35:51):**  to have a fruitful discussion about the value  of regenerative agriculture.  Because if you look at the value of regenerative agriculture  you just do that simple change in terms of looking  at improving carbon, but at the same time  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:07):**  as we improve carbon, we improve water.  Same time we improve carbon and water,  we also improve nutrient cycling within that soil.  And it's not only nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,  it's all the micronutrients that are out there.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:24):**  You got all of those pieces that now become linked together.  And you begin to look at that and say,  those things pay me dividends.  And say, how do these things fit together  from looking at the value of regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:36:43):**  And I'll just use one example and that's  if we take a silt loam soil and have 2% organic matter in it  and assume a five foot profile corn at middle of August  which is using water at its maximum rate  we see across the Midwest.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:01):**  We have about eight days of available water  if we got a full profile before that plant  begins to be stressed.  That's not very much.  That's not very much, but if you go to 4% organic matter  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:14):**  you got 13 days.  So you got five more days of available water  that that plant is not stressed  and is gonna be performing at its optimum.  The probability of getting a rainfall in a five day period  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:27):**  across the Midwest is still pretty good.  My point is that here's one of the pieces that we'll see  just in terms of value relative to productivity.  The other thing we see in that value of productivity  is that when we enhance that nutrient cycling  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:37:45):**  is that we have that greener plant.  We have a more photosynthetically efficient plant  so that we actually are creating more carbohydrates  that go into that plant, not only for grain production  but also still continuing to feed that root system  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:05):**  down below so that it again is more effective all the time.  To me, that's where our yield stability comes from  that variation among years when we begin to do these things  we see that we are less subjected  to this weather variation that's going on.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:21):**  These longer periods of time between rainfall events  we see that and I mean, producers see this all the time  in fields.  I mean, you've got always parts of a field  that are low yielding.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:35):**  I always got parts of a field that are high yielding.  And if you go back and look the high yielding parts  of that field are always the really good soils.  The low yielding parts are always those really poor soils  that have low water availability,  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:38:51):**  have low nutrient availability.  In essence, what you're describing, if I'm understanding  or hearing you correctly is we need to think about  the value and the costs, not just purely in terms of  return on the money that we're putting in  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:05):**  but also return on water, return on nutrients, et cetera.  Yeah, and in fact, I spent a lot of time,  not only on, you know, profitability is one piece  and you go back to this low and high yielding parts  of the field is how many producers change their inputs  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:25):**  between those two different parts of the field?  Very few.  Very few.  I mean, and you can make one improvement in profitability  by reducing your inputs on the low yielding parts  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:36):**  of the field because here's the other piece of this puzzle  is that my contention is that probably  our water quality problems, and I know our sediment problems  are coming from these soils that are degraded  because they don't have any capacity to hold it.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:39:54):**  Water moves through them either because they don't have  the water holding capacity, we either leach through them  or we don't have the water holding capacity  until we get runoff from them.  You know, so I think we can improve our water quality  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:06):**  just very simple dynamic of saying don't put as much  on these low yielding parts because you're not gonna  get a return on it.  The other thing is that I've spent a lot of time now  looking at water use efficiency.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:18):**  How much crop do we get per unit of water used by that crop?  And you'll find out that those low yielding parts  of the field will invest a lot of water  into growing that plant, but when it comes  to the grain filling part, they're water limited,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:36):**  they're water stressed, so even though we had  great harvest potential, we don't realize that  because we, it basically goes under stress,  goes under early senescence, so we don't capture  that sunlight as well.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:40:50):**  So we also see in that part of the field  a very low radiation use efficiency  because we've invested radiation into that crop,  but we haven't got any return on it  in terms of grain yield that we want.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:02):**  When you start explaining these dynamics to producers,  not only are we talking about profitability,  but now we're talking about what sort of return  are you getting for every unit of nitrogen you apply,  and you have to couple that with water,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:17):**  and you have to couple that with light,  and they begin to see that here's the dynamics  of systems in terms of utilizing their natural resources,  but also flipping it back and saying,  what are we losing out of that system  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:31):**  when we don't capture it?  What are we losing in terms of nutrients  that impact water quality?  What are we doing in terms of any of the chemicals  that we put on?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:40):**  Because we haven't utilized those effectively.  And it just tried to open up a different dialogue  with producers.  Jerry, I have an important question.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:41:50):**  How often are nutrients, specifically nitrogen,  phosphorus, and potassium, a limiting factor  in that equation?  When you consider water and radiation,  all the various components that you were describing,  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:04):**  how often is nitrogen a limiting factor?  Rarely.  If you want to be honest about it,  nitrogen is rarely our limiting factor,  although we put most of our importance on nitrogen.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:15):**  In my experience,  I think I could safely say the word never.  I've never seen nitrogen be a limiting factor  because it's the one thing that growers surplus apply  all the time.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:27):**  See, as a scientist, I never used the word never.  You know?  But you're right.  I mean, rarely do we see,  and it could probably be in that never category,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:39):**  that nitrogen is not our limiting parameter.  We always make it that way.  And we think about it that way,  but it's never the limiting factor that's out there.  I mean, I just use another example for you  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:42:52):**  and trying to get producers to realize this,  that how they're managing their soil  and managing their water.  If we look at high water tables early in the season  and this shifting rainfall pattern  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:05):**  where we have more spring precipitation,  and we don't have that soil in a condition  that allows a drainage through that,  or the aggregate structure to allow the oxygen within that,  our root system may be limited  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:19):**  to the upper two feet of that soil profile  because that's all the deeper the plant's gonna grow.  And then when we get into the grain filling period,  we can do this shift from adequate rainfall  to less than adequate rainfall.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:35):**  The plant at that stage is no longer going to grow any roots.  And so we actually have a two foot profile  in which that plant has to exist,  not a whole five foot profile  that the plant could potentially use.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:43:48):**  And so we see that is a water limitation to that plant.  I've often made the statement that water trumps nitrogen.  That's not always the most popular statement to make  because people don't wanna realize  that water drives a lot of this process  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:09):**  and is the factor that really is influencing productivity  more than nutrients out there.  Jerry, we're talking about a complex ecosystem  with lots of nutrients.  And with lots of moving pieces and parts  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:25):**  in terms of climactic inputs, soils, et cetera.  I'm a farmer in Iowa.  Where are the trigger points?  What are the pieces that I can influence  with the least amount of input  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:37):**  that will have the greatest productive changes  to the total ecosystem?  Two things.  One is you have to reduce your tillage intensity  because anytime we stir that soil with tillage  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:44:50):**  is that we're releasing carbon  and we're allowing those aggregates to be exposed.  We just see puffs of CO2 coming out of the soil.  So we really disturb that soil in such a way.  So if we reduce our tillage, it's one piece.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:07):**  The other piece is you can go one or two ways.  You can diversify your rotations and say,  well, I'm going to look at the diversity of rotation  that's out there, looking at saying,  all right, do I add a third crop into my corn soybean system?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:22):**  I can still keep a monoculture within that field,  but I'm just spreading out that it's rotation  or putting even hay alfalfa into that.  Or I can go to that corn soybean system  and figure out how to efficiently add a cover crop.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:38):**  And one of the very fascinating things across Iowa,  when we looked at how much sunlight was available  to grow that cover crop,  just assuming from say black layer on corn  or total leaf drop on soybeans,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:45:52):**  from that point in time until the first frost,  and then from the last frost  until we had a emergent corn or soybean crop,  is that we found out that we have about a third  of our solar radiation that we get through the whole year  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:12):**  is available within those two time periods.  So we have a lot of solar radiation  available to grow plant material  and put it back into that carbohydrates in the soil  and the soil biology.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:25):**  And so for producers in Iowa,  it's really quite simple in my opinion.  One is let's figure out how to capture more carbon  out of your cropping system to put it into  not only something that you want to harvest  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:40):**  and put it into that soil biology.  The other one is to begin to reduce the tillage.  I'm a big fan of strip till  just because a lot of people don't want to know till.  Strip till is just a form  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:46:53):**  where we only disturbing that small amount of soil  in which we're putting our seed or fertilizer  or manure down into that system.  Farmers have shown that there's big advantages to that  in terms of improving their soil carbon,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:08):**  improving their stands,  all those different things that we've seen  in terms of research as well.  And they've seen on their own farms.  So I really believe that we can change this.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:22):**  I mean, we've seen advances in cover crop area  across the state.  We haven't seen as much advanced  in terms of reducing tillage intensity,  but I think that here becomes our challenge, John,  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:35):**  is how do we effectively manage a cover crop  as part of this system?  And then the other one that we have to address  is what is the potential for an economic return  of a third crop?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:47:51):**  I mean, if you look at what's the value  of putting wheat in that rotation,  farmers will say, I don't have a market for it.  If we go to a rotation with alfalfa  and what's in my market for hay.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:03):**  I'm excited about the fact  that we're talking about industrial hemp coming back  and being approved in here.  What can we do with industrial hemp  in terms of paper products,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:15):**  a renewable resource from that perspective?  And how do we manage that?  So I think that here's a lot of things  that we need to be thinking about,  but there are a lot of nuggets  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:27):**  and the nuggets of gold that producers  who are doing these things have shown  that it works across different soils,  different climates within the state, across the Midwest.  And so to me, they're the bright shining examples  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:45):**  that yes, we can make these changes  and it is profitable,  but it requires some management into that aspect as well.  It's no longer just a simple system,  but it requires management investment.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:48:58):**  Yeah, there is a greater degree  of management intensity for sure.  And you raised a couple of questions  that we need to be thinking about  in terms of how to manage cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:07):**  And that leads me to what is the question  that growers should be asking?  What's the question they should be thinking about?  That's a really good question.  What question should they be thinking about?  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:22):**  I think a lot of this, if you go back to cover crops,  is what's the optimum time to put that cover crop in?  I mean, a lot of disruption goes on in our system.  2018 is a really good example of this.  Very wet fall, hard time getting  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:39):**  that cover crop established just because we couldn't get in  to the fields if they wanted to wait until after harvest.  Contrasted that to 2017, really dry fall,  able to get in there, but we had no water  at the soil surface to germinate that crop.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:49:57):**  So all we did in a lot of cases was spread birdseed.  The question I think for producers is how can you,  within your management system, management capabilities,  begin to look and say, what is the pathway  towards improving my soils?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:16):**  And work with those individually to say,  here's the options that you have in terms  of making these changes because we've shown you  that improving your soils is going to add resilience  into your system, that it's going to increase your efficiency  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:38):**  and use of your resources out there.  And so the question is, for producers,  is really quite simple, is how do I do this?  And each one of them is going to be tailored.  There'll be general principles with it,  
**[0:50:53-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:50:53):**  but each one is going to be tailored to their own system.  Well, there you go, friends.  Thank you for listening.  We spoke about a lot of different pieces  that I hope you find valuable and useful.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-carbon-capture-business-with-jerry-hatfield/#t=0:51:04):**  And if you did, please share it with your friends.

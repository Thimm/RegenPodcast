**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:00):**  Well, greetings friends and welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. On this  
**[0:00:04-0:00:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:04):**  show we explore the science of growing exceptional crops and we work to describe why you have  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:10):**  crop challenges and possible disease and insect pests, fruit quality challenges, and how you  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:16):**  can resolve them. Our goal is to give you really clear and understandable information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:22):**  that you can put into action to help you grow better crops, grow healthier, higher quality  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:27):**  food, and be more successful as a farmer. Many farmers have challenges. They have a  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:33):**  desire to grow healthier, higher quality food, and then be compensated for producing healthier,  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:39):**  higher quality food, which is sometimes a challenge in the agricultural marketing sector  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:44):**  as it exists today. In this episode of the show, I'm excited to welcome Matt Kleinhans  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:51):**  from Ohio State University. Matt is a professor of horticulture and crop science and is very  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:00:58):**  interested in understanding the dynamics of produce quality and food quality and then  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:04):**  how that also connects to buyers in the marketplace. So Matt, we're very excited to have you join  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:11):**  us. Welcome to the show. Thank you very much for having me. So Matt, you've done a lot  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:15):**  of interesting work over your decades at Ohio State University and before. What are some  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:21):**  of the memorable moments that have brought you to the spot where you are today and the  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:27):**  various projects that you're working on? Some of the most memorable moments specific  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:31):**  to my career really spring from or involve interactions with growers and other members  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:36):**  of the industry that brought to me a question or an issue that they wanted some input on.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:43):**  And after some likely discussion or experimentation or reaching out to other experts, we discovered  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:51):**  that there may be a partial solution or at least a way forward to reach a solution. And  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:01:56):**  the questions ranged, in this case, they often focused on how to produce more of a better  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:03):**  quality product, mainly to satisfy, you know, their certainly their customers, but also  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:09):**  perhaps a larger aim. So when growers are expressing the desire to produce a higher  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:14):**  quality product, is that demand often coming from buyers? Is that demand coming from perhaps  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:20):**  an altruistic sense that the grower has of producing healthier food? What drives the  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:25):**  desire to produce higher quality? In my experience, John, it's been both. Sometimes a grower has  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:31):**  their own view, of course, their own ethic, their own aspirations. And they simply see  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:37):**  themselves as being part of a much larger picture to enhance people's health and well-being  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:43):**  through the quality of the material that they would supply. In other cases, if you will,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:48):**  it's a little bit less altruistic. It has a business sense behind it. And there may  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:53):**  have even been complaints about the quality of the product or questions about the quality  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:57):**  of the product or questions about how can it be improved. And so they're responding  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:00):**  to a real business scene, if you will. When growers have a desire to improve quality,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:08):**  one of the questions that comes to mind as we're thinking about this and talking about  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:11):**  this is what defines quality in their mind? What are they, and possibly there are some  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:16):**  variations from crop to crop, but in general, what do you see growers seeking to produce?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:21):**  It's a great question. And I've been privileged to try to address that question in different  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:29):**  settings through the years, one-on-one conversations, much like this, but also in a group setting,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:35):**  maybe even as a person that was asked to comment to a select committee, if you will. And the  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:42):**  answers have been different. And we typically start with establishing, at least for the  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:47):**  immediate conversation, what quality is or how it's defined in the eyes of that particular  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:53):**  person or group. Because it has physical components, it has chemical components, it has biological  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:58):**  components, and these various components or properties essentially define the whole or  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:03):**  describe the whole, right? But they may be focused on one particular property. It might  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:09):**  be the shape, the size, the texture, the aroma, the flavor, the color, what have you. They  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:16):**  may be looking at one particular property or component, and necessarily so, but really  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:23):**  that's difficult, perhaps even unwise, to separate it from the whole of the product,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:28):**  if you will, unless there's a very, very specific application in mind. So I would say that there  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:34):**  is rarely one particular component or property that is common to all of a particular grower  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:42):**  group or industry group. It's ranged. But over that time, it has covered, as far as  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:50):**  I can tell, a very large number of properties that we look at in our fruits and vegetables,  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:56):**  especially our fruits and vegetable crops.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:04:59):**  Recently I've been a part of a number of conversations where growers are expressing the desire to  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:09):**  improve the nutritional value. Sometimes they use the language of nutrient density and talk  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:13):**  about to improve nutrient density of food. And my observations have been that for the  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:19):**  most part, the consumers at this stage and buyers aren't really having a conversation,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:25):**  at least not on a large scale, about nutrient density, that in general, kind of the analog  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:31):**  that they're really looking for that might be an appropriate analog for that would be  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:35):**  flavor and aroma. What have you observed? And do you think there is the potential in  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:41):**  the future to have a major market demand for quote-unquote nutrient-dense foods?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:49):**  Let me, perhaps, let me get to that very significant question last, if we will, and maybe break  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:05:55):**  up the response here, John, into a couple of different parts. First of all, nutritional  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:00):**  value or nutrient density is a significant passion of mine, and I know it's a significant  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:08):**  passion for other investigators that I work with, some of whom are not, if you will, in  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:16):**  the so-called public light as an extension person or as a grower advisor. But they're  
**[0:06:24-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:24):**  working tirelessly and quite impressively towards a similar goal, but within their lane,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:33):**  if you will, regarding understanding what nutritional value is and how it can be enhanced.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:39):**  So it is a big passion of mine.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:42):**  So second part of the question, I think we need often to be very specific when we talk  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:50):**  about nutritional value, nutritional density. It is a complex topic and we don't wave our  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:56):**  hands and say, well, just because it's complex, we can't understand it or we shouldn't approach  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:00):**  it. No, quite the opposite. We should stay on task. We should continue to focus on how  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:07):**  a farm can become an instrument of public health, if you will, producing a more nutritious  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:13):**  product, a more so-called nutrient dense product, a more flavorful product, a product that is  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:17):**  more desirable to eat simply because of its chemical, biological, or physical properties.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:23):**  These are all parts of the process, in my view, towards the produce that we offer to  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:30):**  folks playing a larger role in their maintaining or enhancing their quality of life, especially  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:35):**  through their health status. To the final point, will there be a market, will there  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:41):**  be a time when more people are paying more attention to this aspect? I think so, but  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:47):**  we're not there yet. I think that interest already is strong within a small, if you will,  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:54):**  community of eaters or a community of buyers and where there is those so-called beachheads,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:01):**  where there are those loci of interest, there can be growth. Whereas now, here in 2018,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:08):**  we might say if we were able to do a grand survey, one half of one percent of people  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:14):**  make decisions around nutritional value. Some years down the road, we might be able to say  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:19):**  it's five percent or 10 percent. In that increase, there will be so many opportunities for enterprising  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:25):**  growers to be a part of that process that it will become that much more noticeable.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:32):**  As I think about the question of quote-unquote nutrient density, it seems to me that there  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:39):**  are perhaps a couple of different frameworks that people are using to think about this.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:45):**  On one hand, there is a conversation about food biofortification, growing specific plants  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:52):**  that have higher concentrations of needed vitamins or minerals that are needed by a  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:58):**  specific portion of the population and growing biofortified foods that can really help supply  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:04):**  those nutritional requirements. Then there is a second conversation happening around  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:11):**  foods and crops that have inherently high nutrient density by default, such as blueberries  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:17):**  or kale, for example. Then there is a bit of a third conversation happening that believes  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:24):**  that we have lost substantial nutrient value in all crops generally across the board over  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:31):**  the last 40, 50, 80 years, whatever timeframe here in North America. In particular, I've  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:38):**  seen this conversation come up quite regularly. What is your perspective, particularly on  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:43):**  this latter piece? Is there evidence to support that we have lost a lot of nutrient density  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:47):**  in our food supply?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:48):**  Well, it's possible. As a matter of fact, I had a very lengthy conversation on the very  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:54):**  same topic just two days ago with another grower and members of the farm's team. They  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:01):**  asked the very same question. Is there evidence that we've lost nutrient value over time,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:07):**  particularly within, if you will, our fruit and vegetable crops, our specialty crops?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:11):**  My area focuses vegetables. Forgive me if I happen to focus primarily on those as examples.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:19):**  It's just because I'm more familiar with them as organisms and as products and as experimental  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:25):**  subjects and so forth. The vegetable crops tend to be where I turn my focus in conversations  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:32):**  like these. I'm aware that the picture is much larger. It involves, obviously, everything  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:37):**  that we could eat and can eat. I know that there have been reports suggesting that that  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:43):**  is the case, that the nutrient density of the US food supply or perhaps global food  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:47):**  supply has declined over a number of decades. I have no reason to question those reports  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:52):**  at this point in time, but I also have no reason to go out and shout from the rooftops  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:57):**  that the sky is falling. I think the devil is in the details, if you will, if I could  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:01):**  use that phrase as an academic and an investigator and also hopefully an educator and a consultant,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:09):**  advisor. I have to be very, very clear on the source of the information, how the information  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:15):**  was developed and how it's being communicated and what it could mean. I look at the reports,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:22):**  I look at the data and I say, well, that might be the case. There are pretty understandable  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:26):**  reasons for that. I'm not justifying it as a trend. I'm saying, look at what has happened  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:31):**  over the last 50 to 80 years in our food supply and the way we provide it and what people  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:38):**  consume and what they expect of it. It can't be seen as a separate phenomenon from how  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:45):**  we've taken on our day-to-day lives. As I think as we began this conversation, how we've  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:11:55):**  gone about our day-to-day life and what that means to individual growers. Growers respond  
**[0:12:03-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:03):**  to what the market asks them. They are business people par excellence most of the time. They're  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:12):**  working – I don't need to tell anybody on this call what it means to be a grower and  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:19):**  what the fact, the forces that they face, but they're responding – one of those forces  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:24):**  that they face is the demand. What does the market demand? If the market has not demanded  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:31):**  nutritional value, does not reward them financially for it, but instead rewards them for abundance,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:39):**  for consistency, for other attributes, that is what they're going to provide. Who should  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:46):**  fault them? I guess I'll leave that part of the question. There were other parts of that  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:51):**  same biofortification piece and whether or not there are products that are inherently  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:12:57):**  more nutritionally dense than other ones. We can return to those if you like or we can  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:02):**  move on.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:03):**  Well, the follow-up question that I would have to your response, and I absolutely agree  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:10):**  that growers are responding to the market. Of course, this is not just because of buyer  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:18):**  demand but perhaps also because of the mantra that has been adopted by the agriculture industry  
**[0:13:25-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:25):**  as a whole for the need to quote-unquote feed the world. And that has been a kind of a subconscious  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:34):**  driving force I would expect for many growers that has – and of course, we have the economic  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:40):**  incentives, which are a major primary incentive to incentivize growers to produce large volumes  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:46):**  and abundance perhaps at the expense of quality and perhaps not.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:50):**  Yeah, and this is maybe a section when I push back just a tiny bit. I'd say, and it's just  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:56):**  a conversation among friends here, I'd say that in an individual grower's decision on  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:02):**  how they approach the management of their farm and their crops, of course, I can't climb  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:08):**  inside somebody's head. But what I've observed over the years is that they have their farm  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:15):**  and their own personal welfare in mind first, the health of the industry second, and they  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:21):**  have to have a hierarchy, they have to have priorities. And what I've seen is we don't  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:26):**  point necessarily finger at the industry and say, well, this is where the industries let  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:30):**  us or taken us. No, these are day in, day out, season in, season out decisions that  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:36):**  a grower makes regarding what they grow, who they sell it to, and what price are they receiving,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:43):**  and what is required to make it all work. And little by little, farm by farm, region  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:51):**  by region, if you will, industry by industry, one could look at the cabbage industry or  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:55):**  the lettuce industry or various industries. They're not monolithic. There's quite a diversity  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:01):**  within each. But you say, look at them farm by farm, area by area, and say over time,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:08):**  national transfer over time, people have chosen to respond to the opportunities that so far  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:17):**  on the whole do not reward producing less but of higher nutritional value, simply because  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:23):**  I would say the math is not in their favor on the whole. There just aren't enough people  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:30):**  that will pay more for the same product if it's claimed to be more higher nutritionally  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:36):**  dense than the product that's not. Because they're responding to their pocketbook. So  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:43):**  if I offer, if I go to the farmer's market and I have a head of lettuce that looks in  
**[0:15:47-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:47):**  every way identical to the one that my neighbor and competitor has on display, and mine is  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:55):**  twice the cost but it looks in every way the same, but I try to make a claim that it is  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:01):**  more nutritionally dense, how many customers will I have that walk away having given me  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:05):**  the, you know, bought the product? Moreover, what evidence will I provide that my claim  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:10):**  is true? And on what will I base it? We talk about nutritional value as if it is one thing,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:17):**  it is most certainly not one thing. There are many components of nutritional value.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:26):**  But most of the time the conversations speak of it as if it is eye color. You know, it's  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:31):**  not, it's a very complex attribute of a food item. And I think to understand it fully and  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:41):**  its origins fully, like how is it shaped, one needs to really study it and be prepared  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:48):**  to adopt at least temporarily some reductionist thinking. And then reassemble all that, all  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:55):**  pieces that come from that reductionist thinking into something that's more holistic.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:59):**  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you and I think we are saying the same things. This is, I  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:04):**  believe this entire conversation has been one area of confusion, particularly within  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:11):**  the organic industry. And I know, I'm certain that many of the growers who are listening  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:17):**  are not necessarily organic, but there is, it seems every several years, there is an  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:23):**  industry report that gets published saying that organic foods have been discovered to  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:30):**  not be any more nutritious than conventional foods. And then a short while later, there's  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:35):**  a rebuttal from the organic industry that, oh, in fact, organic foods are supposedly  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:40):**  more nutritious than conventional foods. And this is kind of this back and forth that has  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:46):**  been happening for quite some time. I've seen the cycle repeat itself multiple times. And  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:51):**  yet when you stop to think about it, organic certification has no parameters for nutritional  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:58):**  quality. It does absolutely nothing to certify the quality of the end product in terms of  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:02):**  nutritional value or otherwise. It is purely a process certification that says a certain  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:07):**  process was used that hopefully should substantially reduce the number of toxins and pesticides  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:14):**  that might be on the food supply. It makes no reference to quality. And so I think, or  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:20):**  to nutritional value. And so I think there's this conversation happening around nutritional  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:24):**  value that really has no basis in the regulations or in the certification process, which I find  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:31):**  to be an intriguing conversation. But I'd like to, I'd like to switch gears for just  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:36):**  a bit, Matt. And I'd like to ask you the question in all the work that you've done working with  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:41):**  growers, working with various crops, what has been the one thing that has really puzzled  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:46):**  you for a long time? Goodness gracious. There are a number of things have puzzled me, but  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:53):**  I don't mean to, I don't mean to respond with humor. It's not a, it's not a divisive laugh.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:18:57):**  It's the laugh, it's a laugh born of the memory of so many mind blowing conversations that  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:07):**  I've been fortunate to have with people in which I've learned so much through, I've learned  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:13):**  so much through those conversations, but I've also been dismayed if you will, by some of  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:19):**  the lack of understanding that folks sometimes exhibit around the crops that they grow. Basic  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:25):**  biology. And I wonder, you know, how would one practice medicine without knowing anatomy?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:32):**  How would one practice law without knowing basic precepts? How would one practice, be  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:39):**  a plumber and not know, you know, lefty loosey, righty tighty? You know, how would one be  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:45):**  as effective as they possibly could be at their chosen profession without a firm grasp  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:52):**  of what I would call some of the basics? And what I've noticed is the capacity for people  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:19:58):**  to produce a lot of material because they follow a process, but in that process, or  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:04):**  in, they don't know the finer points of the process, nor the finer points of the organism  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:08):**  that's at the central part of it. And so it's almost as if they're succeeding thanks to  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:14):**  the process that was laid out for them by others, not because they have an in-depth  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:20):**  understanding of the crop. And occasionally that lack of understanding leads them to a  
**[0:20:27-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:27):**  problem that befuddles them and it holds them back. It may even undercut their income. And  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:35):**  of course, understandably, they get confused, frustrated, so forth. Then in some cases,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:41):**  the answer is right before them, if only they had understood a little bit more about their  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:45):**  crop. And so I guess the one thing that can, you know, kind of confuses me or has struck  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:51):**  me is if you will, the lack of understanding of certain basics around each of the crops  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:57):**  that they grow.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:20:58):**  Matt, this is an incredibly important piece. And I had no idea how you would answer this  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:03):**  question, but this is, I've been chuckling to myself because this is something that we  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:08):**  have observed as well, quite frequently in our consulting work and in areas where crop  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:16):**  production has become more intense and more competitive, where crops are managed very  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:21):**  intensely and margins become a lot tighter, risk becomes a lot higher. It is almost invariably  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:27):**  these growers that don't have the foundational knowledge that end up not surviving for what  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:33):**  ever reason. It might take a few years, it might take a decade, but invariably, it does  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:38):**  seem that these are the growers that don't survive in the long term. So the question  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:43):**  I would have for you is following up to that is from your perspective and observation,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:49):**  what are the important pieces that you would recommend that growers should study and should  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:55):**  become really familiar with?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:21:57):**  Great question. And I'd like to hasten to add that, you know, the understanding that  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:03):**  I spoke about earlier, it can come from many different places and I'm sure that people  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:07):**  listening appreciate the different ways of knowing, the different ways of coming to understand  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:14):**  something as complex as lettuce growth or tomato growth or what have you, different  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:20):**  ways of knowing. And in my baseline, my kind of constitutive, always on way of thinking  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:28):**  is that to employ more of them leads to a better outcome. So to your question about  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:34):**  pieces, you know, what are the important pieces? I would include in that, you know, obviously  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:40):**  what they're doing on a day to day basis, the business of farming, the process of farming,  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:46):**  take notes, observe, take notes. If a camera is an option, take pictures, record. In down  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:22:53):**  times, when there are any, in down times, study those notes, look at those pictures,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:00):**  think about what was going on at the time, install ways of collecting more information.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:06):**  People say, well, what can I do in that way? Well, there are very simple devices to record  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:11):**  temperature. One can measure obviously rainfall and so forth, flow meters on the irrigation.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:17):**  There are steps that can be taken that will describe their system, if you will, to them  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:22):**  for themselves and maybe even for others that will provide very important bits of information.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:28):**  And in the process, they've not changed really anything about their farming practice. They  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:32):**  simply know more about it actually. And soil testing would be another obvious example.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:38):**  Because if they, if at some point they need to turn to somebody else for input, maybe  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:43):**  somebody like me or you, we value that information. I'll say myself, I value that information.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:49):**  I'd say, boy, if I had more input, if I had more data, so to speak, if I had more information,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:54):**  I could help you, I could be more effective at helping you. So that's one piece. Just  
**[0:23:57-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:23:57):**  take, observe, take notes, record as much as is reasonable and be strategic about it.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:06):**  The second part would be read, listen. If videos are an option for you, watch credible  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:15):**  ones. Be healthily skeptical of what you're seeing and reading. Don't accept 100% at face  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:23):**  value just about anything, but don't be so skeptical that you accept nothing. You know,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:27):**  be an informed consumer of information. And as you deal with the confusion that can come  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:34):**  with that healthy skepticism, there still will be growth. And I think in the long run,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:40):**  the quality information rises and then you can, you know, rely on it. It can be put to  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:48):**  better use. So I'd say employ as many ways of knowing as a person can consistently and  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:24:56):**  just begin with the simple ones. Take notes, you know, record, take pictures and go over  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:01):**  them and in your spare time, do some reading.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:03):**  Matt, your comments bring so many thoughts to mind. I have a few to share. I'll perhaps  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:10):**  begin with a quote from William Albrecht that comes to mind. In one of his articles, he  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:15):**  wrote the quote, read books and study nature and when the two don't agree, you throw out  
**[0:25:22-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:22):**  the books. And I think, of course, there's an element of humor in that, but the fundamental,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:32):**  I think that perhaps encapsulates a bit of what you're describing and kind of the foundational  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:38):**  piece if you want to read books and study nature, and then when the two don't agree,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:44):**  throw out the books. In order to be able to throw out the books, that means you need to  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:48):**  have very high quality observation, which goes to the point that you're making as observation  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:54):**  is absolutely key in being able to understand what's going on.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:57):**  Absolutely. You know, through those observations, one might be able to write their own book,  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:02):**  right? That maybe somebody later will throw away or maybe not, maybe that book will remain,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:07):**  you know, quite viable and informative for a very long time. So, yeah, absolutely. There  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:14):**  is, I don't want to say there's a lifetime to all information so much as there is a lifetime  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:20):**  to how it is applied in certain ways. And what we see, I think, in the evolution of  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:27):**  understanding of people's business is their reliant change in what information they rely  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:34):**  on or seek, okay? As they become more proficient at certain areas of their business, they no  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:41):**  longer need certain types of input as dramatically as they may have needed, you know, some years  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:47):**  before and simultaneously they're seeking out other types of input. So if we boom running  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:52):**  back, John, just for a real quick second, we boom running back to the question of nutritional  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:26:57):**  value, they could begin with, okay, well, what is nutritional value anyway? How would  
**[0:27:01-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:01):**  a dietician, nutritionist, a health professional define it? Not as it's being defined by people  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:09):**  who are recycling information. I want to go to the primary source and ask, well, what  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:15):**  do they do with it? Well, you know, there are people, professionals of one stripe or  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:20):**  another that have written some very impressive, provided some very impressive resources on  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:27):**  nutritional value of various food items. And learning from that primary source can be enormously  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:34):**  important. So to bring this back, you know, ways of knowing about the farm, what to do  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:38):**  with one's soil, you know, what to do with one's whatever, you know, aspect of the farming  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:43):**  operation. If one looks for input and doesn't find it, that's a cue on something. That's  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:50):**  a clue that maybe it's not been investigated, maybe it's not been written about. And so  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:55):**  they are at the so-called cutting edge of understanding it.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:59):**  One of the pieces that we've observed in working with growers, we've observed one characteristic  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:05):**  of growers that are exceptionally successful that has really stood out, which is these  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:11):**  most successful growers seek to understand the answer to the question is, how do you  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:18):**  make money? How do they make money? And so if for many, particularly for fruit and vegetable  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:23):**  crops, as you mentioned at the beginning, oftentimes, the key to having a successful  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:30):**  profitable crop is some quality component, whether it might be fruit size or fruit shape,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:37):**  or a specific firmness, there are often very specific fruit characteristics or vegetable  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:42):**  characteristics that are desired by the market. And one of the things that we've observed  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:48):**  is that the most successful growers seek to understand that specific characteristic and  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:55):**  how to manage it. They don't delegate that piece to an agronomist or a consultant or  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:01):**  an advisor. They want to understand if the key to having a profitable tomato crop is  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:10):**  having a high soluble solids content, what are the specific components and factors that  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:16):**  contribute to achieving a high percentage of soluble solids. So they focus in on that  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:22):**  piece specifically, and they want to make sure that they personally understand that  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:27):**  very deeply. They don't delegate that knowledge. And I think this speaks to this entire conversation  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:34):**  of what are the important pieces for us to learn about as growers, I think really understand  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:39):**  the pieces that contribute to profitability can be a very valuable place to begin.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:45):**  No question, I agree with you completely. They don't delegate in part because consciously  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:52):**  or subconsciously, they recognize that quality is the target. In my perspective, quality  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:58):**  is the platform for repeat sales. One might be able to make the initial sale based on  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:05):**  some other factor, but the repeat sale comes from the quality as one enormously influential  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:12):**  component of the overall value that the buyer sees in the product. Of course, there's a  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:16):**  price quality interaction, but one never really wants to be racing for the bottom price, do  
**[0:30:23-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:23):**  they? In that scenario, the importance of quality is diminishing, and as the price rises,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:33):**  the value of quality in that calculation in the buyer's mind increases. So my argument  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:41):**  has been you want a better price, raise the quality. Improve the value of the transaction  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:48):**  that you're trying to consummate with the buyer by offering them something in return  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:53):**  that is going to prompt them to give you more money for the product as far as ways of knowing  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:58):**  and many on this. So if one goes to the produce auction and they see what's being bought,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:05):**  what the prices are, that is immediate feedback on what sells and what does not sell, correct?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:10):**  I mean, there's no more dramatic demonstration than at the farmer's market on Saturday or  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:16):**  at the produce auction or wherever one can see another person's product and what is being  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:21):**  sold, purchased, and what price. And to be a student of that transaction, I think, is  
**[0:31:29-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:29):**  one way of improving one's operation. Understand why yours was purchased or not, and understand  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:38):**  why it got the price that it did and how it could possibly go higher. And in as much as  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:44):**  quality is a fat force in that, understand what the buyers are responding to. It could  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:49):**  be the color, it could be the shape, it could be the consistency, whatever it is. Remember,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:54):**  those physical, chemical, biological components of it. If it happens to be nutritional value  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:59):**  or the holistic expectation that the buyer has about it enhancing their diet in some  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:06):**  way, study it and understand the origin. And I know that Brix or Total Soluble Solids is  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:14):**  on many people's minds, but Brix is not a nutritional component. It has little bearing  
**[0:32:20-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:20):**  on nutrition, specifically. Nutrition as people who study nutrition for a living define nutrition.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:29):**  Brix has other implications, but they rarely include nutrition, specifically. And so as  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:38):**  I say, be a student of it and agreeing with you completely. The grower rarely delegates  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:45):**  what's most important because it tends to be something they want to have more control  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:48):**  over, be more informed about. And in the case of quality, it's often the target of what  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:52):**  they're trying to produce.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:53):**  Matt, what do you believe to be true about agriculture today that many other people don't  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:59):**  believe to be true?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:00):**  Well, I hear from so many people and I hear so many different perspectives on agriculture.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:06):**  I hear that it's going to heck in a handbasket. I hear that it's enjoying a complete revitalization  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:14):**  and everything in between. So I hesitate to say, to point to one area and say, oh, this  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:21):**  is something that people don't believe to be true. But I would say that there are areas  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:25):**  that are topics that I hear about less than other areas. And I would say one of those  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:32):**  that I hear less about that I'm not sure people more widely appreciate is what role the grower  
**[0:33:39-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:39):**  plays in our culture, in our society, and in our daily life. They're part of a fabric  
**[0:33:49-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:49):**  that is ensuring our access as consumers to healthy, nutritious, safe, and enjoyable to  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:59):**  eat, please and do eat food day in, day out, meal in, meal out. They're kind of like this  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:06):**  background group of folks that many in the population take for granted. That's unfortunate,  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:13):**  but there are probably a number of reasons for that. So what do I believe to be true?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:18):**  They're often underappreciated, underrecognized, but they keep on going just like we hope that  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:24):**  they do and have done for so long.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:27):**  So within that, obviously you've thought about this a little bit, and you believe that growers  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:32):**  are underappreciated, which I absolutely agree with. Have you given any thought to how that  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:38):**  might be remedied?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:39):**  Well, I think not to share enough popular idea, but I think they need to ask more of  
**[0:34:46-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:46):**  themselves. And I also think that they could benefit from being a bit more assertive professionally  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:55):**  about what they do, how, and why, and what role they play. It's obviously, you know,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:02):**  there are dozens of possible responses to that. Some people will become activists, if  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:08):**  you will. Some people will become involved in grower organizations. Some people will  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:15):**  keep it one-on-one and simply have excellent conversations with their buyers on Saturday  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:19):**  mornings or wherever they happen to encounter them, all of which are necessary. But on the  
**[0:35:26-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:26):**  whole, I would encourage folks to use the opportunity to display their understanding  
**[0:35:35-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:35):**  of the farm's role and the food's role in that person's life, because too many of our  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:42):**  eaters, a lot of our eaters, more or less just eat to avoid being hungry, right? Which  
**[0:35:47-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:47):**  is entirely fine. It's a choice. Others, though, look to food for other types of, if you will,  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:55):**  return on investment. You know, it's an enjoyable experience. So when a grower encounters a  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:01):**  person or market that might be wired that way, might be thinking of food differently,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:07):**  if you will, having higher expectations of it, ideally, I'd like the grower to be able  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:11):**  to step up and say, yeah, this is what we do and how and why and have data, okay? Have  
**[0:36:18-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:18):**  a real foundational argument for whatever assertion that they would like to make. But  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:26):**  a lot of us, understandable, and a lot of us are on the farm doing our thing and being  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:33):**  out and about and mingling with the masses, if you will, is not necessarily their forte  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:39):**  or interest, but there are other ways of having an impact and playing a role.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:46):**  Yeah, I completely agree with what you've described. And one of the pieces that really  
**[0:36:51-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:51):**  stands out for me is those growers who have been able to really make an impact, in my  
**[0:36:59-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:36:59):**  observation, with consumers and with eaters, are those growers who communicate why. They  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:07):**  communicate why they make the choices that they make and the decisions that they make.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:11):**  There certainly is an element of describing what they do and how they do what they do.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:17):**  But I think the most, from my observation, the most important piece that resonates most  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:23):**  deeply with eaters is kind of describing why you need to make these various decisions and  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:30):**  these various choices that the consumer may or may not necessarily agree with. But when  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:34):**  you describe the situation of what's happening and why you need to make these choices, their  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:41):**  appreciation for the challenges and the difficulties and the opportunities in agriculture completely  
**[0:37:46-0:37:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:46):**  changes.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:47):**  Yeah, so we don't want to... We want to be careful here. We want to elevate as much as  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:53):**  possible the position of the grower within the whole spectrum of our society and our  
**[0:37:58-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:58):**  agriculture. And we want them to be successful. I would say, thinking more about your question,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:05):**  the single most common source of struggle that I've seen over the years begins with  
**[0:38:11-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:11):**  the grower looking at their product only as a farmer, unable to see it in a more comprehensive  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:18):**  way, but most especially as the buyer sees it. That's what I've observed is attitudes  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:25):**  like, well, if I eat it, everyone else should be able to eat it too. Or if it's acceptable  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:29):**  to me, why isn't it acceptable to you? It's rarely expressed that way, but that's the  
**[0:38:35-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:35):**  attitude. And when a grower is able to completely see the product from completely the other  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:43):**  side of the table as the shed their grower, if you will, as much as possible, shed their  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:49):**  grower attitude temporarily and see the product as if they're buying it for how it's going  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:54):**  to be used by the buyer, then they're on, I think, a really exciting path to looking  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:00):**  differently at their own farm and possibly being able to exploit market opportunities  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:05):**  that they didn't see before. That's the single most consistent aspect of a vegetable farm  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:12):**  now, especially a vegetable farm that might be selling directly to consumers or some sort  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:17):**  of buyer, but even those who work, you know, grow for processors.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:21):**  That's a fascinating observation. I love it.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:23):**  They need to see it as the buyer does and unequivocally so, you know, without reservation,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:29):**  not kicking and screaming, no, welcome the opportunity to see the product as the buyer  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:35):**  does. You will return to being a farmer, no worries. But when you return to being a farmer,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:41):**  hopefully you carry that experience of seeing the product differently with you. And all  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:45):**  of a sudden for some, it'll be like, actually, I'm not producing kale. I'm producing food  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:51):**  that somebody is going to serve at a family function and it's got to be just so, you know,  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:56):**  they see this kale or they see it as this or that or tomato. We do these exercises with  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:02):**  students in the class, in my class where I hand them a tomato or I hand them a potato  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:07):**  and I say, tell me what you see. And everyone looks at me funny. I'm like, no, tell me what  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:12):**  you see. And we're not, you know, and you'd be amazed by the kinds of words that are used  
**[0:40:17-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:17):**  to describe ordinary products. But in that comes the discussion, okay, now, this is,  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:25):**  now we're on a path towards understanding what that tomato is. And if you give that  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:29):**  same, go through that same exercise, for example, like I have with students in the dietetics  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:34):**  nutrition arena versus the students in the agriculture arena, it's amazing how they look  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:41):**  at the same thing and use different words to describe it. And so to a grower, to understand  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:47):**  how others see the product is indispensable.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:50):**  That's such a fascinating observation. And I, I'm smiling to myself because I'm recalling,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:40:58):**  I'm recalling a farm that a colleague of mine worked on a number of years ago. And it was  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:05):**  a large commercial farm growing salad greens and in particular lettuce. So they had this,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:12):**  they had a couple of different lettuce fields that were affected by a major hailstorm within  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:16):**  about eight or 10 days of harvest. And as they were visiting these fields, when they  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:22):**  visited the first field to kind of inspect and evaluate the damage, the, my friend asked  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:28):**  the grower, when you think of this field of lettuce, what does it mean to you? And what,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:34):**  what do you think of? And why are you growing lettuce? And the grower's response was, well,  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:40):**  I'm growing lettuce. My goal is to have 800 cases per acre. And when I think of it in  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:46):**  my mind's eye, I see it as 800 cases packed in the cooler, ready to ship out so that I  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:53):**  don't want to get a good price for it so that I can be profitable to keep growing this crop  
**[0:41:55-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:41:55):**  again in the future. They went to the second field and the second field had very similar  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:04):**  damage, almost the exact same amount of hail damage. And my friend asked the grower, he  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:09):**  said, now, when you, when you think of this field of lettuce, I want you to not think  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:13):**  about this in terms of profitability and cases of lettuce in the cooler, but instead I want  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:18):**  you to imagine and visualize a young family with a couple of young children sitting down  
**[0:42:25-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:25):**  to eat dinner and they are having a salad that is made with your lettuce. And so they  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:32):**  were just having this conversation talking about this. And I, I know I'm probably going  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:36):**  out on a limb here quite a bit, but there was this intriguing crop response that when  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:42):**  they, when they evaluated the two fields, the amount of hail damage within, when it  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:47):**  was observed within a few hours after the hailstorm was virtually identical in the two  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:51):**  fields. Two crops have been the same variety, planted the same day, but when they went to  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:42:57):**  harvest, the first field they had, they only had about a 20% harvest because of all the  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:03):**  hail damage. The second field where the grower had a different mental image of the crop that  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:09):**  he was producing, they had an 80% yield. So, tremendous different, tremendously different  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:17):**  response from the plants in the field. Now, I know this is pretty far out there. Did,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:24):**  did those plants respond to a different mental image of what they were being produced for?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:29):**  I don't know. I'm not going to suggest that they were, but there definitely was something  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:33):**  majorly different in those two fields. And it was, that observation kind of really caught  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:40):**  my attention. Like I keep, that's one of the things that I puzzle over sometimes is just  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:46):**  what really was going on there? What was happening? What did we miss?  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:50):**  So, right. So, I mean, I, clearly I don't claim understanding of much of anything, even  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:43:57):**  beyond the vegetable production, but as you observe other, other aspects of many people's  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:03):**  daily life in terms of what they buy, their transportation, their clothing, their music,  
**[0:44:09-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:09):**  their appliances, so on and so forth. I think a number of very successful companies recognize  
**[0:44:16-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:16):**  that, you know, perhaps with vehicles, it's, it's not just transportation, it's the feel  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:25):**  that one has in the vehicle or when looking at the vehicle. Okay. There's something else  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:30):**  going on or, you know, the particular item of clothing or whatever it might be. I'm not  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:35):**  trying to draw parallels between those directly, but I am, I am, you know, wondering out loud  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:40):**  if, you know, a fresh look at what is actually being offered for sale on the part of the  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:46):**  grower in terms of, you know, the produce, a fresh look, meaning a grower, a, I'm sorry,  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:53):**  a buyer informed look would do, would go a long way in helping them, you know, day in  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:44:58):**  and day out. And I know that they say, and cause I've, you know, I've been part of those  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:02):**  conversations. Look, I get that kind of feedback when I see what's left over at the stall or  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:07):**  when people come into the farm market and they, you know, they pick what they pick,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:11):**  they don't pick, you know, and I see what's left over. So I am getting that feedback.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:14):**  I say, I know agreed, but are you actually asking them in any other way what they actually  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:19):**  came in for? It's possible that they took something away simply because they had to,  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:25):**  they didn't have enough, enough time to make another stop, but they won't be back or they're  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:30):**  not overly enthusiastic about what they, what they took away. They took it because they

**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:39):**  you know, I'm not going to be, this will not be my first destination. So they have an internal  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:44):**  control on that day at that time at that point of sale, but do they really have a more comprehensive  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:50):**  understanding of what the buyer was looking for? Maybe not. That comes with some real,  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:45:55):**  you know, if you will, sophisticated, but focused attention to what the buyer is actually  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:00):**  looking for. And, you know, more and more of that would help.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:04):**  Robert L  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:09):**  deeper question, perhaps that what is, what is the job that the buyer wants this food  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:15):**  to do such as is this food, does this food have a purpose of, it needs to appear really  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:22):**  well on the Thanksgiving dinner table, for example. Are you asking more about the, its  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:27):**  purpose, it's kind of its, its greater purpose other than just nourishment?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:32):**  Robert L  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:33):**  Certainly, but I'm advocating more, more, more, perhaps more mundanely, if you will,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:37):**  or day to day, I'm, I've had what I'm advocating is for growers to be as, as informed about  
**[0:46:42-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:42):**  what their buyers would, one, expect as a minimum, but two would, would aspire to as  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:49):**  much as possible. Because remember, and, you know, buyers have, you know, especially those  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:46:54):**  who are chefs, who are reselling the product, produce managers at grocery stores, intermediaries,  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:00):**  if you will, and even some individual consumers, of course, they have aspirations to they,  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:06):**  they are hoping we're here on here in this conversation, we're talking about how growers  
**[0:47:11-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:11):**  can grow and adapt. Well, so are other business people, and individuals, they're growing and  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:18):**  adapting. We see evidence of this, you know, quite profoundly, and I can, I can cite one  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:23):**  here in just a moment. But for the grower to be in step with that market, that individual,  
**[0:47:29-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:29):**  that that group, or to, or to even sidestep them, if you will, make a parallel move and  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:35):**  become more informed about another group, I think is only to their advantage. So however,  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:39):**  however, whatever it, wherever it leads, to be more informed about what the buyer is expecting  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:45):**  right in the here and now, and would reward later, is only to the growers advantage. Now  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:51):**  specific to a specific example, I'm part of a much larger team at Ohio State University  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:56):**  that is involved with understanding or working to understand connections between diet and  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:03):**  health, but particularly within the fine community of eaters, if you will, these being cancer  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:09):**  survivors. And these, these are folks that have gone through their primary treatments,  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:14):**  and are now on the other side of that. And they are some subset of them are being provided  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:21):**  with access to freshly harvested fruits and vegetables. Okay, they have an entirely different  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:28):**  outlook on diet, having gone through their treatment, their diagnosis and treatment,  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:34):**  now having a different appreciation for and view on diet health relationships, they have  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:39):**  an entirely different view of what they will buy, and what they will look for. They, and  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:46):**  some of these folks, of course, are midlife and older, they have, and of course, they're  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:50):**  not going through that scenario alone. They have family, they have friends. So they, my  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:56):**  point here is that with their newfound or, you know, revitalized appreciation for diet  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:02):**  health connections, and now focus on what they eat, you know, are growers being a partner  
**[0:49:07-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:07):**  in that process? Are we doing any, are we taking any steps to connect with people who  
**[0:49:14-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:14):**  have a new interest in food? Or are we going to leave it to chance? Are we going to leave  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:20):**  it to them going into their local store and talking to the produce manager or their restaurant  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:27):**  or whatever it might be? Is it going to be just chance and the grower will get whatever  
**[0:49:30-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:30):**  comes their way? Or will growers be proactive in that process? And of course, when they're  
**[0:49:37-0:49:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:37):**  asked, can you grow a more nutritious product? Be able to say, yes, indeed, I can. And, oh,  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:44):**  it will have elevated levels of this, this and this. Because of course, the dietetics  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:49):**  nutrition and oncology community will have certain expectations of them. It isn't just  
**[0:49:55-0:50:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:49:55):**  like waving hands and saying it's more nutrient dense. No, there are specific bioactive compounds  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:01):**  that matter. Will the growers know about those? And will they be able to manage their crop  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:06):**  accordingly? You know, we want to get to this higher plane. Everyone needs to step up their  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:12):**  game. Advisors, scientists, growers, we're all being asked to do more. But in that, there's  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:18):**  greater opportunity as well, I think.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:20):**  So let's actually, I'd love to expand on that thought that you just expressed at the end.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:26):**  From your perspective, where is the greatest opportunity for growers today? Where's the  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:31):**  greatest opportunity in agriculture? Where's the greatest opportunity to move to that next  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:36):**  plateau?  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:37):**  Continue to do what they have done for many years very well, but do it better. We focus  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:43):**  now on social implications of farming and farming systems and agriculture overall. We  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:50):**  focus on the social component. That's very, very important, you know, so-called food equity,  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:50:55):**  food access, food availability, food security, that aspect of food security. Be a partner  
**[0:51:01-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:01):**  in the process to some level in enhancing the social component of what they do, their  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:10):**  environment. Be connected in some way. Secondly, environmentally. Yes, we ask a lot of growers.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:16):**  I mean, they have a lot of demands on them. They're supposed to do this, this, and this,  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:20):**  and this, you know, and oh, by the way, do it with these criteria, meet these criteria.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:25):**  But do one's level best to use the natural resources that are required to produce food  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:30):**  well. Be a good steward of the earth, okay? Probably there will be rewards for that. One  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:38):**  can be certified organic or not, but that's a choice. But be a good steward of the natural  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:44):**  resources that are required to produce food. And then finally, as far as the economic piece,  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:50):**  if you will, you know, be a steward of the farm in that and a student of the farm in  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:54):**  that. Of course, you're trying to run a business. You're trying to be successful at it. You're  
**[0:51:57-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:57):**  trying to have a generated income. And as many steps as can be taken in terms of understanding  
**[0:52:04-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:04):**  the market and enhancing perhaps the price that they get, you know, what would that involve?  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:12):**  Be a student of it. Explore it. I think those are possibly the greatest needs, if you will,  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:19):**  or the greatest opportunity.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:21):**  If you had to make one recommendation for growers to learn more about any of these various  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:27):**  areas, if you had to recommend one book for people to read, what would that be?  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:33):**  Oh, wow. Expecting that people will be coming at this, John, from different places. Maybe  
**[0:52:39-0:52:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:39):**  not one book so much as one step. Learn something new. Challenge yourself. If you've been listening  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:46):**  to or watching or reading, you know, kind of information coming from one primary source,  
**[0:52:52-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:52:52):**  check a second one. Get an alternative point of view. Do not become too comfortable with  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:00):**  what one knows to be, quote, true. Question healthily. And so, you know, if one is reading  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:07):**  only, you know, if you will, the scientific literature, you know, hey, look, look at some  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:13):**  other literature as well. If one is only, if one is not having, if one has had no exposure  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:17):**  to the scientific literature, no exposure to research, no exposure to those kinds of,  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:22):**  that kind of information, I think it's high time to start. If one has never picked up  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:26):**  a book describing the physiology of tomato or kale or whatever, I think it's, I think  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:33):**  it'd be a good time to do that. Challenge yourself to learn something new about your  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:38):**  crop and or your farm.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:40):**  Yeah, your earlier comment reminds me of a quote that I believe is attributed to Charlie  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:47):**  Munger, where he describes the work required to have an opinion. And he says that in order  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:53):**  for you to be allowed to have an opinion, you need to be able to articulate the opposing  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:53:58):**  point of view better than the opposition.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:00):**  Well, we see this in, if you will, in some high school forensics, you know, programs,  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:06):**  speech and debate programs, where knowing the opposing point of view is essential, even  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:10):**  though you're going to espouse, you know, your point of view. To see the issue in the  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:15):**  round is very, very important. And, you know, you're still free to make the choice to adopt  
**[0:54:20-0:54:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:20):**  one point of view or another. But to be familiar with the other or any other, I think, has  
**[0:54:27-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:27):**  become essential. And at least as an investigator, as you know, as an academic, that's kind of  
**[0:54:31-0:54:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:31):**  part and parcel of, you know, a career there, because we see how as new data emerge, we  
**[0:54:39-0:54:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:39):**  have to revise our thinking on a topic. And academics are fairly adept at picking out  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:46):**  folks who are operating with, quote, old thinking. I mean, it's just something you become, you  
**[0:54:52-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:52):**  know, somewhat adept at. They're not up on the current information, so on and so forth.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:54:58):**  And you know, some of that is okay, it's acceptable. It's a challenge to remain up to date, but  
**[0:55:04-0:55:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:04):**  it's necessary. So I would say for farming, it's the same way. If you are, you know, if  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:10):**  a grower is not aware of some of the newest trends in technology, in what people respond  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:15):**  to in terms of their food, you know, like you said earlier, it's only a matter of time  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:21):**  before that so-called ignorance or being unaware will perhaps have undesirable consequences.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:29):**  Speaking of technology, what technology or ideas are you really excited about for the  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:36):**  future of agriculture and believe hold a lot of untapped potential?  
**[0:55:40-0:55:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:40):**  So some of those, given the types of operations I interact with most often, okay, I would  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:49):**  say there are two sectors that are related. One is grower-friendly technology that can  
**[0:55:55-0:56:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:55:55):**  be implemented on the farm in terms of monitoring their environment and understanding the connections  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:02):**  between that environment and their cropping outcome. So we call them sensors, you know,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:07):**  fire loggers, miniature temperature sensors, ones that will communicate with the grower  
**[0:56:11-0:56:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:11):**  through, for example, a cell phone or a computer if they have one. Those are interesting to  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:18):**  me.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:19):**  Matched up with more computing power, if you will. I know that we have more computing power  
**[0:56:24-0:56:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:24):**  in a standard laptop than one on the Saturn rockets that went into space, and it seems  
**[0:56:31-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:31):**  like, well, isn't that enough? But I think it's the analytical capabilities that we're  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:35):**  beginning to implement that will matter to growers going forward.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:41):**  I think there's a rather large untapped potential out there for growers who are connected to  
**[0:56:46-0:56:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:46):**  some types of databases and other resources that technology can bring to them that would  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:54):**  inform their thinking. So, for example, I'll just ask the question of a grower perhaps  
**[0:56:59-0:57:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:56:59):**  listening to this conversation, how much do they know about the people within a 50-mile  
**[0:57:08-0:57:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:08):**  radius of their farm regarding any factor that would influence their food choice? How  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:15):**  much do they truly know? It's not about prying and snooping on the Internet. It's about understanding  
**[0:57:21-0:57:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:21):**  data about the demographics of the people around them. Understanding those data more  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:26):**  thoroughly may give them insights into how they could reach them, and when they reach  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:31):**  them, what would be valuable to them as a vegetable, somebody offering vegetable crops,  
**[0:57:36-0:57:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:36):**  for example.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:37):**  Is there a new population, ethnic population coming into the area that would be looking  
**[0:57:41-0:57:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:41):**  for a certain type of vegetable that that grower could provide? Is there a new employer  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:45):**  coming into the area? Is there an employer leaving the area? I mean, any number of factors  
**[0:57:49-0:57:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:49):**  that would influence food choice and where people interact with their food, particularly,  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:53):**  if you will, vegetables, I think would be information that they could employ if they  
**[0:57:57-0:58:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:57:57):**  happen to be active in the local regional markets. Obviously, for people who are shipping  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:03):**  all over the country, they're tracking this anyway. They have a hand in that to begin  
**[0:58:09-0:58:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:09):**  with.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:10):**  Matt, we've covered a number of very intriguing topics, and I'd like to end with kind of an  
**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:16):**  opening question. What is the one question you wish I would have asked? What's the piece  
**[0:58:21-0:58:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:21):**  that you would have loved to discuss in this conversation?  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:24):**  Goodness gracious, I've been so focused on what we have been talking about. I, at some  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:28):**  point, if it would be useful, I'd like to return to the question of nutritional value  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:35):**  and so-called nutrient density. It's a term that I call and others have called nutritional  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:40):**  yield instead. That's a combination of the traditional yield as we measure it, pounds  
**[0:58:46-0:58:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:46):**  per acre or what have you, times the nutrient value that it contains and concentration of  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:53):**  this product or that metabolite or another metabolite. That's the metric that we have  
**[0:58:58-0:59:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:58):**  been using in some of our studies to understand if we can move the needle on nutritional yield,  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:05):**  recognizing that for the moment, most growers are paid by the pound, right? Not so much  
**[0:59:11-0:59:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:11):**  by the nutritional value, but anticipating a time when the proportion of the price as  
**[0:59:21-0:59:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:21):**  a proportion of the normal yield and the nutritional value has changed. In other words, people  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:27):**  value nutrition more highly. I'd like to ask of growers, what are they hearing? What are  
**[0:59:32-0:59:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:32):**  they seeing from their customers regarding the role of nutrition or quality, flavor,  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:39):**  texture, so on? I'd like to learn more from them to get a sense for whether or not my  
**[0:59:46-0:59:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:46):**  reading of the situation is accurate. I think that we, in order to guide the work going  
**[0:59:54-0:59:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:54):**  forward.  
**[0:59:55-0:59:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:55):**  Matt, I think this is a very intriguing conversation. I'd love to dig into it a little bit more  
**[0:59:58-1:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:59:58):**  deeply. I think that particularly, there's a couple of different questions here. There's  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:04):**  obviously the question of food quality, but also from perhaps a macro perspective of needing  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:11):**  to grow better nutrition, or I should say, perhaps say more nutrition for a growing world  
**[1:00:17-1:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:17):**  population. Should we perhaps also begin measuring crop production in terms of protein content  
**[1:00:24-1:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:24):**  per acre or carbohydrate production per acre for what will actually be used as a food source?  
**[1:00:31-1:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:31):**  So what are your thoughts?  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:33):**  Some of that is already being done. Perhaps not much is being made of it publicly, but  
**[1:00:38-1:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:38):**  of course, I call it the composition or the makeup of the major components of the food  
**[1:00:44-1:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:44):**  supply in the US and Europe and other places, that's tracked. There are federal and state  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:50):**  agencies that do that, that's mostly federal. Federal agencies that do that, that's what  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:54):**  they're tasked to do. So we have some really capable people who are not only involved in  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:01):**  creating those data, but also in analyzing those data. We can model, for example, what  
**[1:01:06-1:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:06):**  the impact would be if we ate, as a population per capita, if we ate one pound less of meat  
**[1:01:13-1:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:13):**  per year, what that could mean in any number of ways. Or if the certain parameters, certain  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:21):**  properties of the food supply went up by X percent, what could that mean from the standpoint  
**[1:01:26-1:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:26):**  of diet and health? We have some projections that way, and they're very intriguing. I would  
**[1:01:33-1:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:33):**  say that in as much as a grower would try to build part of their business around that  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:41):**  process, look, I am acknowledging the day-to-day realities that most farmers appear to face.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:48):**  It's a huge challenge to do much of anything other than produce the crop using ways that  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:53):**  are very familiar and reliable. So to add on to that, wow, you're asking me to become  
**[1:01:58-1:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:01:58):**  an expert in nutrition, no, no, no. Just take a few steps forward in that direction to appreciate  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:07):**  and understand where there might be a market opportunity for you to grow the business based  
**[1:02:12-1:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:12):**  on the quality of the crop and the markets that you're now trying to access. And so be,  
**[1:02:18-1:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:18):**  as much as you can, shape the market rather than only respond to the market, if you will.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:23):**  I think that's maybe a message that I didn't make very clear and some may have already  
**[1:02:28-1:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:28):**  picked up on is to whatever extent possible, create the desire, create the market, don't  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:02:34):**  just respond to it. We're talking about a spectrum that way. So how would I as a grower

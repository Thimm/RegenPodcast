**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:22):**  information on the topic that we can.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:23):**  It's an honor and a privilege to do this for you.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:26):**  Our goal is to provide you with a podcast that shares inspiring  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:30):**  and actionable information.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:31):**  I believe that freely sharing information helps all growers and farmers making a  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:36):**  global positive impact on how food is grown.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:40):**  This season, like last, is brought to you by a company I founded,  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:44):**  AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:47):**  At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food and making more money from  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:51):**  your crops with regenerative agriculture is possible.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:54):**  And since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:58):**  to deliver just those results.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:00):**  To deliver those results at AEA, we don't guess, we test.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:05):**  We make certain that we measure the exact nutritional profiles of what  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:09):**  is happening in plants and soils.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:11):**  Then we provide recommendations based on data and our agronomic understanding of  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:16):**  what we've learned from looking at all that data, and we've developed products  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:20):**  that are uniquely positioned to help growers make more money and that have  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:25):**  consistently seen positive results in the field because AEA produces this show.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:31):**  That means that we do not have to sell ads and we're not beholden to advertisers.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:35):**  This gives me the freedom to host anyone that brings value to the community,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:39):**  even competitors to AEA, which I've done in the past and to gift free promotional

**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:47):**  This season, the team and I are looking forward to presenting even more

**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:08):**  amazing Don Huber.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:10):**  In this episode, Don describes how plants can become resistant to airborne  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:15):**  pathogens and insects based on a plant's nutritional integrity and the ability  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:20):**  to metabolize nitrogen compounds and reducing versus non-reducing sugars.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:25):**  He references the nitrification process and describes how we can reduce

**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:32):**  He describes how we can reduce nitrogen use with nitrification inhibitors, and  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:37):**  we can achieve the same results by converting all the applied nitrogen to  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:41):**  amino acids.

**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:53):**  very technical and very actionable.

**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:57):**  Hi, friends.  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:58):**  This is John.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:59):**  I'm passionate about developing regenerative agriculture systems that  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:03):**  improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to diseases and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:07):**  insects, and produce food of such an exceptional quality that we can have a  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:12):**  legitimate conversation about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:15):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:19):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:21):**  However, much of this knowledge and information is scattered all over the  
**[0:05:24-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:24):**  place.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:24):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that have not been  
**[0:05:29-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:29):**  widely shared.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:30):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to bring this knowledge together in  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:35):**  a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems that  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:39):**  growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:42):**  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative agriculture systems become  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:46):**  the mainstream globally, the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:50):**  are compared.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:51):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge that we have learned in the  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:54):**  last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:57):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems can be applied  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:01):**  anywhere, and when they're properly applied, they will increase farm  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:05):**  profitability and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:12):**  would like for me to discuss, please connect on social media or email me,

**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:29):**  I'm very honored to be back with Don Huber, who we had on the podcast last year  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:37):**  for a fascinating interview where we spoke about developing disease suppressive  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:42):**  soils and the interactions of minerals and nitrogen and various compounds in  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:46):**  producing high quality and high yielding crops that are resistant to disease.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:52):**  We received a lot of really favorable feedback from that conversation and  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:56):**  really welcomed your constant input.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:58):**  So I wanted to have Don back to have follow-up conversations on other aspects  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:04):**  of plant nutrition and plant quality that we didn't have the opportunity to talk  
**[0:07:07-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:07):**  about.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:07):**  So Don, welcome back and thank you very much for being here.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:12):**  It's an honor to be with you, John.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:14):**  I appreciate the opportunity.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:16):**  Don, we had such a fascinating conversation last time we spoke, and a lot of  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:21):**  people have come back with additional questions.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:24):**  And I think there's a really intriguing conversation that's emerging that  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:28):**  growers haven't historically thought about the possibilities of developing  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:32):**  disease resistant crops based on how they manage nutrition and cultural  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:37):**  management practices.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:38):**  So there's several questions that have emerged, and I'm just going to go  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:42):**  through these in no particular order.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:43):**  They're from a variety of different topic areas.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:46):**  One of them was we were speaking about photosynthesis and about the quality and  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:51):**  the quantity of photosynthesis and how photosynthesis can be increased.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:55):**  And in that conversation, you made reference to that a really healthy plant  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:00):**  should have no backlog of glucose and fructose levels, but that we want the  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:06):**  plant to store sugars as sucrose.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:09):**  Can you elaborate on this a little bit and what this means for you?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:12):**  Well, photosynthesis is the basic system of capturing that sun's energy.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:24):**  And we store it as sugar or as protein or as amino acids.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:29):**  And then amino acids are converted to protein with the nitrogen, but 80,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:36):**  85% of your nitrogen is stored as enzymes, not stored, but in the plant as  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:45):**  enzymes and your storage sugars are as carbohydrates.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:53):**  So it's important that you have that energy for the plant from a growth  
**[0:09:00-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:00):**  standpoint and also a response standpoint for defense against stresses that may  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:09):**  come in, whether they're biotic or abiotic stresses.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:14):**  And anything that compromises photosynthesis is compromising the basic  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:21):**  system that we're relying on for growing that plant.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:27):**  I mean, that's our purpose there.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:30):**  So I'm not sure what the concern is on storage.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:36):**  The storage can be in various forms and then it's metabolized one way or the  
**[0:09:46-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:46):**  other as it's needed and depending on the storage capacity, but we start out  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:55):**  with the seed, the endosperm in the seed supports the germ and that's primarily  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:03):**  the carbohydrate and storage proteins that support that early seedling  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:10):**  development and seedling growth, good for about 25 to 30 days in most seed crops.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:19):**  And if you don't have all of your nutrients pretty much in order in that  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:25):**  time period, so that machinery can work effectively, the enzymes can work  
**[0:10:32-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:32):**  effectively, then there'll be often irreversible yield loss, even though you  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:44):**  may provide the nutrients later.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:46):**  So it's important to keep the plant really nutrient-sufficient from day one  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:56):**  of germination and development in order to both capture the sun's energy and  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:03):**  store it as sugar as well as to utilize that sugar and then the protein that  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:11):**  can also be stored there later on for the plant or during development.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:19):**  Are there any negative health consequences of plants having high  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:24):**  levels of fructose and glucose?  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:28):**  Yes and no, depending on what other stresses.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:33):**  If you have a deficiency of manganese, for instance, it can't store the reducing  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:43):**  sugars, glucose and fructose that are being produced through photosynthesis,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:49):**  can't store them as sucrose.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:52):**  And so they become very attractive, the reducing sugars become very  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:59):**  attractive for insect pests and also number of plant pathogens.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:07):**  So it's one of the consequences of that certain nutrient deficiencies,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:14):**  manganese being just one of them.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:17):**  But manganese is a critical factor for that sucrose phosphate synthase  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:25):**  enzyme that converts glucose and fructose into sucrose for storage.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:33):**  And so if you're deficient in that and you have high reducing sugars,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:40):**  glucose and fructose, especially in the system as an insect aphids and that  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:49):**  fly over, they can detect that high reducing sugar and it's for them,  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:57):**  it's kind of a red flag saying, hey, come in for dinner.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:02):**  Where if it was converted to sucrose and stored there, you don't see that  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:08):**  attraction nearly as much.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:13):**  It's not as leaky from the root system.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:20):**  You'll see it's your reducing sugars that are coming out of the root system  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:25):**  that are in the root exudates that are attracting your pythium and phytophthora  
**[0:13:32-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:32):**  and phonomyces, those other old mycetes pathogens, root rotting pathogens  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:41):**  that are attracted then through failure of that system or activation of the  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:48):**  system through those root exudates.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:54):**  So in essence, what you're describing is that when plants have adequate  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:58):**  manganese and other enzyme cofactors to convert the glucose and fructose  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:04):**  into sucrose and into reducing sugars, we have reduced susceptibility to  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:09):**  phytophthora and to these other soil borne organisms that you're describing.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:14):**  Right.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:15):**  Many of our pathogens are dormant in the soil.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:19):**  They can be there in very high populations, but as long as they're  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:23):**  dormant, they're not going to be causing any problem for us.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:31):**  And so if you activate those spores and they're usually activated by  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:38):**  external nutrient sources, then they wake up and say, Hey, it's time for dinner.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:46):**  And they'll be attracted to those root exudates that are coming out of the  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:51):**  plant and of course, when we have a zinc or boron deficiency or that you also  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:58):**  have a very leaky root system so that your amino acids and carbohydrates are  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:04):**  lost through the root exudates rather than being stored and available for  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:11):**  growth and development in that process.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:16):**  For many of our pathogens, the dormancy factor in the soil is by bacteria  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:24):**  that coat the or grow around the resting structures of the pathogen,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:32):**  whether it's a chlamyto spore or a regular spore or an old spore.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:39):**  You'll get bacteria that will grow around that and they're metabolizing those  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:45):**  nutrients that are leaking out of the dormant spore,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:51):**  dormant fungal or old myc spore, so that the critical level for  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:58):**  germination of those is not maintained.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:00):**  We call that process fungistasis.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:05):**  In other words, it doesn't kill the spore or resting structure, whether it's  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:13):**  a scrotum or a spore or whatnot.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:17):**  Doesn't kill the fungus, but it keeps it in a dormant state so that it's not a  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:23):**  problem for us.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:24):**  And so when you change that balance, then the bacteria and organisms that are  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:35):**  responsible for keeping them dormant in that biological control mechanism are no  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:42):**  longer attracted to the spore, but are able to develop and be free living,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:49):**  active in the other environment, soil environment, so that they no longer  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:57):**  perform their function in fungistasis.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:00):**  They're independent of that kind of synergy, that relationship that develops there.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:10):**  That's the importance of minimizing those stresses, especially nutrient stress  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:16):**  on the plant, because it changes the root exudation.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:23):**  You're always going to have some root exudation and we need that in order to  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:30):**  maintain the soil population.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:32):**  But it's when you have certain nutrients, especially the reducing sugars, are very  
**[0:17:40-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:40):**  attractive to those bacteria and organisms that would normally suppress the growth and  
**[0:17:50-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:50):**  development of our pathogens, then you see the pathogens developing because of that  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:58):**  food source that they're attracted to, rather than the other organisms that might  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:04):**  be in a close association with the pathogens to suppress it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:12):**  Essentially, the quality or the integrity of the carbohydrate profile that is being  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:21):**  moved out from the root system determines whether bacteria are suppressing potential  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:27):**  pathogens or not.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:30):**  Definitely.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:31):**  A close relationship there.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:36):**  That's one of the reasons why different crop rotations or crop sequences or cover  
**[0:18:43-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:43):**  crop mixes have a major effect on your disease and stress pressure is because of  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:52):**  the both the mineral nutrients, but also then the metabolites that those mineral  
**[0:18:59-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:59):**  nutrient support and the plant determine what that nutrient environment is for the  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:08):**  soil.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:10):**  If you have a very rich nutrient source and a lot of those metabolites, the  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:20):**  organisms that would normally be very suppressed, they may not feel a need.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:25):**  If we can think of it teleologically, they may not feel a need to be dependent on the  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:36):**  soil environment as much as being attracted to the source of this new food material  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:44):**  that's being released from the plant under stress.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:48):**  Don, you describe how the carbohydrate profile can attract aphids.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:56):**  Are there other insects that can be attracted as well by the carbohydrate profile?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:03):**  You'll see a lot of them are.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:04):**  I don't know that all of them, but many of them recognize the difference between the  
**[0:20:10-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:10):**  reducing sugars and they don't seem to see the beer be attracted to the non reducing sugars  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:19):**  nearly as much.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:20):**  So you'll see that association when we get the mineral balance and sufficiency levels  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:33):**  established for the plant.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:35):**  You'll see all of those problems starting to disappear or be very minor.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:43):**  In our last conversation, we spoke about the capacity of nutritionally sound plants to  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:53):**  become resistant to soil borne pathogens and organisms residing in the soil.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:59):**  We haven't spoken about airborne pathogens such as bacterial and fungal pathogens.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:05):**  How can we develop plants that are resistant to those organisms conceptually?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:11):**  Well, you'll see the same thing there.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:15):**  Pathogens are looking at the plant.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:17):**  I mean, they're attracting us as a food source, nutrient source.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:21):**  And also some of them actually require specific nutrients in order to cause disease.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:33):**  So several of the roughs, for instance, require an exogenous source of zinc on the  
**[0:21:41-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:41):**  leaf, an available source of zinc before the spores will germinate and you get infection.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:52):**  So if you don't have that exudation of those minerals on the leaf, then those pathogens  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:03):**  are much less severe because they don't have that specific nutrient resource.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:09):**  Now, some of the pathogens can change that nutrient availability.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:15):**  And you'll see a lot of your bacterial pathogens, your black rot and some of those  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:21):**  organisms that produce cederophores, which are essentially chelators to increase  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:28):**  the soil ability and availability of iron.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:32):**  And you'll see that with those cederophores, they're able to actually cause a depletion  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:41):**  or a deficiency of available iron in the infection site for plant functions, for your  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:48):**  energy relationships and all of that, that iron is involved in.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:53):**  And so it's important to maintain the availability for the plant in spite of the cederophore  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:03):**  production by the pathogen.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:05):**  And if we can block that cederophore production, you block the disease causing mechanism  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:13):**  also for that particular pathogen, particular organism, whether it's black rot or whether  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:21):**  it's rust or whatnot in that area.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:27):**  How do you block the cederophore production?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:31):**  Well, we do that with some of our antibiotics that we use for bacterial disease control,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:40):**  whether it's in humans or animals or a plant, when we use those, a lot of those are blocking  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:49):**  the cederophore production by the pathogen.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:53):**  You see that with fire blight on apples and pears, your black rot pathogens, you know,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:01):**  or Winia and Pseudomonas, Amptomonas that produce those cederophores.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:10):**  And we block them also nutritionally by compensating for the plant and keeping the plant's  
**[0:24:21-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:21):**  metabolism and defense reactions fully active so that in spite of what the pathogen is doing  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:30):**  and minimizing and reducing the availability, we keep enough active and available for the  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:37):**  plant that that doesn't have an effect.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:44):**  The pathogen reduction is compensated far so that it can't compromise the resistance  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:52):**  of the plant.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:54):**  It's my understanding that many bacterial and fungal pathogens require a specific amino  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:05):**  acid or perhaps a general amino acid and carbohydrate profile to be within the plant.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:10):**  And that when we change the amino acid profile, it's possible to change susceptibility or  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:17):**  resistance to some of these organisms.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:21):**  And that is one of the mechanisms by which different varieties are resistant or susceptible.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:27):**  Is that a correct understanding?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:29):**  And can you explain that a little bit?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:31):**  Yes, in part.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:35):**  The early fungicides that we used for apple scab, for instance, didn't have any direct  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:45):**  effect on the fungus.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:49):**  Their effect was changing the amino acid profile in the plant so that I believe it was a  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:57):**  spare gene that was no longer available or released on the leaf surface and that.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:07):**  So the pathogen never had that essential amino acid that it required for establishment  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:14):**  and infection.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:16):**  And we see that with a number of amino acids, certain amino acids will increase disease  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:23):**  severity, others will be a very strong inhibition to it.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:30):**  And one of the techniques that I developed early on in my career was amino peptidase  
**[0:26:39-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:39):**  profiling, where we could actually identify microorganisms just by their amino acid profile.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:49):**  And when we had very difficult organisms to culture, all we had to do was to run the  
**[0:26:58-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:58):**  amino peptidase profile on that particular organism and with just adding three or four  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:07):**  amino acids to a little bit of sugar and some minerals, all of those organisms that we had  
**[0:27:14-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:14):**  considered obligator very fastidious organisms could be grown in a simple, well-defined  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:23):**  culture media.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:24):**  And I've done that for the rust in the mildew pathogens as well as many of the human  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:32):**  pathogens.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:33):**  Wilford Lee has five patents for human pathogens, just patenting the media for their  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:45):**  culture in the laboratory.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:48):**  And I don't know of any organism that we have followed that system on that we haven't  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:55):**  been able to culture in the laboratory so we can do the other studies.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:00):**  It's one of the grant proposals that Bruce Hemming and I had submitted to the Florida  
**[0:28:08-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:08):**  Citrus Foundation so that we could start getting the information on control of HLB or  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:19):**  Greening Disease on citrus.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:22):**  We could never get funding to do that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:24):**  It doesn't take very much but fairly straightforward approach, but you'll see that specific  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:31):**  amino acids can be very inhibitory.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:35):**  That's one of the things for the rust and the mildews.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:39):**  Most people that have been trying to develop media for those obligate organisms want to  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:46):**  make sure they don't leave something out.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:48):**  The problem is they throw everything in the mix except the kitchen sink.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:53):**  And one or two amino acids work every bit as effectively for some of those pathogens,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:01):**  obligate pathogens, and stopping their growth as any of our fungicides.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:08):**  It's a very sensitive relationship.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:11):**  So it's not a matter of making sure you have everything there.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:16):**  It's making sure that some of those natural products and metabolites aren't present to  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:25):**  support the virulence mechanism of the pathogen.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:29):**  We see that with Fusarium, with a lot of the other pathogens, that that nitrogen metabolism  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:37):**  is very critical for them.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:40):**  One of the reasons why you see shading controlling greening disease is because with shading you  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:50):**  brought photorespiration that provides those nitrogen intermediates then for the pathogen.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:00):**  I think this is a very powerful understanding, Don, that the next step in understanding and  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:07):**  managing nitrogen metabolism within the plant for disease resistance is understanding a  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:13):**  specific enzyme cofactors that are required to produce the amino acid, the antagonistic  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:19):**  amino acids that we need to develop.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah, we can look at those nitrogen compounds and go right back, trace your physiologic  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:30):**  pathways, and they'll go back to some minerals.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:34):**  And that's how we regulate the availability of those metabolites that are involved in  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:43):**  the disease reactions.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:47):**  Don, a lot of our conversation has been revolving around nitrogen, various nitrogen metabolites.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:52):**  And at the beginning of our conversation, you spoke about the importance of supplying  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:00):**  nitrogen in particular, as well as other nutrients, right from the germination period, right as  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:07):**  the seed germinates.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:09):**  And I think this has been a question that has come up on several occasions is it seems  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:15):**  that we're no longer managing nitrogen very effectively.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:18):**  We're not managing nitrogen very effectively at all in our commercial corn production systems.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:23):**  What's the most effective way to manage nitrogen in a corn management culture?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:28):**  Well, with nitrogen, you have to realize that we lump it all as one element.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:38):**  We call it just nitrogen.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:40):**  But from a plant standpoint, we should probably look at that as two different elements because  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:47):**  you have it in two different forms.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:50):**  Each of them equally available from a physiologic standpoint in the plant.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:55):**  But it can either be in the reduced ammonium form or it can be in the oxidized nitrate  
**[0:32:01-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:01):**  form.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:03):**  So that the pathways for utilizing that nitrogen are quite different depending on the form  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:12):**  of nitrogen that's available.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:14):**  Most plants can utilize either form equally well.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:19):**  There are some exceptions, blueberries and rice, where nitrate is not utilized efficiently  
**[0:32:28-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:28):**  at all.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:28):**  In fact, maybe even toxic.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:32):**  But for most plants, you have the mechanism of physiologic pathways to utilize either  
**[0:32:39-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:39):**  one.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:39):**  Nitrate can't be utilized by the plant unless it's reduced back to an amine or an amino  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:48):**  form.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:49):**  The reduced form is what the amino acids are made from.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:54):**  So that if you're deficient in molybdenum, molybdenum is a critical element for that  
**[0:33:02-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:02):**  nitrate and nitrite reductase enzyme system that puts the nitrate nitrogen in an available  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:11):**  form for the plant to use.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:13):**  And without molybdenum, that system just doesn't function.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:18):**  There's no cofactor, so you turn the key off of the engine, the enzyme, the systems that  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:26):**  make that work on it.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:30):**  So again, we're back to that mineral nutrition being the driving factor.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:38):**  It's the cofactor to get those enzymes going and sustain them.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:48):**  So if we have the nutrition, have the minerals available, then all of those pathways can  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:56):**  work and the plant pretty well utilizes nitrogen.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:59):**  But when we just talk about nitrogen per se, we often don't identify what that form of  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:07):**  nitrogen is that we're talking about.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:10):**  And it can have an all or nothing impact on disease severity for many of our pathogens.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:17):**  So we need to recognize those relationships and those factors that are involved, not just  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:27):**  from a nitrogen efficiency standpoint, but from a disease and overall health standpoint  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:34):**  of the plant from a stress relationship.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:39):**  What is the best way to manage, and I'm going to use the word nitrogen again, but we could  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:44):**  say ammonium or nitrate.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:46):**  What's the best way to manage these nutrients to produce the highest quality and the highest  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:54):**  protein content?  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:55):**  These are directly involved in producing high test weight, protein content, and overall  
**[0:35:01-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:01):**  quality.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:01):**  How should we think about managing these nutrients, particularly for a grain crop such as wheat  
**[0:35:07-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:07):**  and corn?  
**[0:35:09-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:09):**  For wheat and corn, your most efficient source of nitrogen is ammonium.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:19):**  And that's because it takes energy to reduce nitrate back to the amine farm or to reduce  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:27):**  it to the amine farm to combine with the carbohydrates to form the amino acids and the proteins.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:36):**  So that it's going to require energy.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:39):**  And as long as the plant is photosynthesizing, probably has adequate energy to reduce nitrate  
**[0:35:49-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:49):**  back.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:49):**  But when you get into the high potential and for many of these crops, there's a very significant  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:58):**  impact between the different sources of nitrogen.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:03):**  With the nitrate nitrogen requiring 12 to 16% of all of your sugars that are being produced  
**[0:36:11-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:11):**  through photosynthesis just to reduce nitrate to the amine farm for enzyme production.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:19):**  And physiological function.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:23):**  It doesn't have to do that with the ammonia.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:27):**  So that you already have it in the reduced form.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:32):**  Now the problem with the ammonia is that that can't be stored in the plant.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:40):**  So that it has to be metabolized as it's taken up.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:45):**  And then a very small plant that can stress it for energy that might be needed for overall  
**[0:36:53-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:53):**  growth or for other functions, just in combining with the ammonia to form the glutamine and  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:01):**  glutamate and asparagine amino acids that then are translocated throughout the rest  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:08):**  of the plant and utilized physiologically.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:12):**  So with excess ammonia or very high ammonia levels at any stage, you may induce the carbohydrate  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:24):**  stress and that's what ammonia toxicity is.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:27):**  There's really a depletion of your carbohydrates as you see that ammonia combined with the  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:36):**  carbohydrate to form those amino acids.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:39):**  And where with nitrate and nitrogen, the nitrate can be stored in the plant tissues without  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:48):**  becoming actively involved physiologically so that you don't have that deficiency of  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:57):**  your carbohydrates induced by excess ammonia.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:01):**  Now one of the things that is used to increase nitrogen efficiency are the nitrogen stabilizers,  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:13):**  your nitrification inhibitors.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:17):**  And that's in a soil relationship because nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia to  
**[0:38:24-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:24):**  nitrate nitrogen is a biological process in the soil with a couple of bacteria, nitrosomonas  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:33):**  and nitrobacter, that convert ammonia to nitrate nitrogen.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:39):**  And it's a nitrate nitrogen that is soluble and also is reducible to the elemental nitrogen  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:49):**  and nitrous oxides where it can be lost in the atmosphere where ammonia is a positively  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:57):**  charged ion, is attracted to the negatively charged soil particles and relatively stable  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:04):**  in the soil.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:06):**  So that you don't see that nitrogen loss with the ammonia like you see with nitrate  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:12):**  nitrogen in the soil.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:15):**  When you have either anaerobic conditions, as we see often with continuous no-till, you'll  
**[0:39:23-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:23):**  see much higher loss of nitrate nitrogen in no-till than you'll see in a tilled soil just  
**[0:39:33-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:33):**  because of that anaerobic reduction of nitrogen and then the volatile loss of nitrous oxide.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:42):**  So nitrification inhibitors are very effective in stopping that bacterial process of conversion  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:52):**  of ammonia to nitrate nitrogen in the soil.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:56):**  And we can improve nitrogen efficiency 25 to 30% with very effective nitrification inhibitor  
**[0:40:06-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:06):**  compounds, it's actually implementing a natural process that we see taking place ecologically  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:16):**  when we do that.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:18):**  Because all of our climax ecosystem crops, whether it's a hardwood forest or a conifer  
**[0:40:26-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:26):**  forest or grass prairie, all of those climax plants reduce root exudates that inhibit nitrification.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:36):**  So what they're doing is they're conserving that limited nitrogen availability that they  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:43):**  have under those circumstances so that they're not leached or denitrified but available for  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:50):**  the plant utilization.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:53):**  Sulfur, acidification of the soil, there are a number of ways to do that that inhibit nitrification.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:02):**  Those all become important when we have high nitrate leaching and looking at the form of  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:11):**  nitrogen and its metabolism in the soil as well as its metabolism in the plant.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:17):**  You must have read my mind.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:22):**  I was just about to ask you about nitrification inhibitors when you began speaking about them.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:27):**  One of the additional questions that comes up when we think about these two different  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:32):**  forms of nitrogen, how should farmers think about managing urea?  
**[0:41:37-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:37):**  Urea is kind of a different system. It can't be utilized until its ammonia is released.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:49):**  And that's usually very easily done. The urease enzyme is one that you can usually or quite  
**[0:41:57-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:57):**  often detect even in a sterile soil. So you don't necessarily have to have a lot of  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:05):**  urea. You don't necessarily have to have a living organism. You can have the enzymes  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:11):**  from a living organism that will hydrolyze urea. That urease enzyme is fairly stable  
**[0:42:20-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:20):**  in the soil and available then to hydrolyze the urea to release the ammonia.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:29):**  Very important with urea and my research, we found that if you just broadcast urea out  
**[0:42:38-0:42:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:38):**  on the soil surface and have a little bit of dew, that you can lose 80% of that nitrogen  
**[0:42:47-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:47):**  from the urea from when the urease enzyme releases the ammonia because there's nothing  
**[0:42:54-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:54):**  to keep it from volatility. If you have some residue and it can be incorporated a quarter  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:03):**  of an inch or half an inch, you can save all of that nitrogen. So it doesn't take very  
**[0:43:09-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:09):**  much to capture it, but it's important that it not just sit on the surface of the residue  
**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:16):**  or sit on the surface of the soil without having enough water to move it in or tilling  
**[0:43:23-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:23):**  it in, working it in a little bit to prevent its volatility loss. The ammonia is very volatile  
**[0:43:33-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:33):**  unless it can be combined or attracted to those negative soil particles. There are urease  
**[0:43:42-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:42):**  inhibitors and my experience, I never found them very effective because it wasn't just  
**[0:43:52-0:44:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:52):**  the urea that we were trying to manage that biological process, but then you also have  
**[0:44:00-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:00):**  your nitrification that takes that ammonia then the organisms, different organisms will  
**[0:44:09-0:44:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:09):**  convert it to the nitrous oxides then through to nitrate nitrogen and then either leaching  
**[0:44:20-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:20):**  or green oxidation losses can occur. So we needed both an oxidation inhibitor and a  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:30):**  urease inhibitor if we were just going to put it out on the soil surface and not get  
**[0:44:38-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:38):**  enough moisture to irrigate it in or rainfall to move that urea into the soil so the ammonia  
**[0:44:48-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:48):**  could be utilized. Now we use urea, a lot of urea, you get 46% nitrogen so it's a fairly  
**[0:44:58-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:58):**  good concentrated source of nitrogen, but we also need to recognize that there can be a high  
**[0:45:07-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:07):**  loss to it unless we have a way to capture that ammonia as the urea is hydrolyzed.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:17):**  Don, if we have a desire to produce a high protein content grain and a high test weight  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:21):**  grain, what's the optimal timing of nitrogen applications?  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:28):**  Well the optimum timing for nitrogen application is any time that the plant is not sufficiently  
**[0:45:36-0:45:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:36):**  supplied with that essential nutrient and there probably isn't any element that'll have a greater  
**[0:45:43-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:43):**  impact on yield or protein quality. If you look at the elements individually, protein is a nitrogen  
**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:53):**  compound so any time that it's deficient the primary deficient periods are going to be in  
**[0:46:01-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:01):**  that high yield grain fill period that you see during grain formation for corn or wheat as you  
**[0:46:12-0:46:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:12):**  fast. So that's going to be a critical factor for a high protein or high quality in your product  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:25):**  is to make sure you don't run out of nitrogen late in the season. Now for sugar beets they  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:33):**  force the grower to run out of nitrogen on sugar beets which means that you're shutting down some  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:39):**  of your photosynthetic potential in that but that's because nitrate nitrogen interferes with  
**[0:46:46-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:46):**  sugar extraction so looking at the sugar extraction rather than the overall weight or  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:57):**  yield potential of the plant. For corn and wheat that grain fill period is very critical to maintain  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:05):**  full nutrient nitrogen sufficiency. A lot of situations that's where your nitrification  
**[0:47:13-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:13):**  inhibitors come into play. Our side dressing, a later application of nitrogen to make sure that  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:24):**  you have nitrogen available for that grain fill period and to get you past the  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:31):**  soil high loss periods that we typically see in the temperate areas here for  
**[0:47:37-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:37):**  leaching and denitrification losses of nitrogen during our high soil moisture conditions.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:46):**  There's a direct relationship between the carbon nitrogen ratio in the kernel and yield.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:55):**  If you're into a situation where you have a high carbon nitrogen ratio available at  
**[0:48:09-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:09):**  optimum would be somewhere around nine to one from a physiologic standpoint that nine to one  
**[0:48:18-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:18):**  would indicate that you've got enough carbon to combine with the nitrogen or enough nitrogen to  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:26):**  combine with. If you're a larger ratio than that, less nitrogen available, then you're not meeting  
**[0:48:34-0:48:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:34):**  the biochemical potential of the plant so you're compromising yield or quality in that relationship.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:46):**  I remember a conversation that you and I had where you described some work that Charles Tsai  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:53):**  had done on calculating the biochemical potential and carbon to nitrogen ratios.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:57):**  Are there specific kernel development stages that we should be measuring carbon to nitrogen ratios?  
**[0:49:03-0:49:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:03):**  Yes, that'll be in the real critical and milk stage and early dose stage.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:13):**  Getting it there in those tissues at that particular stage of growth because of the lag  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:21):**  that's required physiologically to keep all of that functioning and full efficiency.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:30):**  Don, this has been a wonderful and very insightful conversation. I've enjoyed it tremendously and I'm  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:36):**  sure many growers will as well. Are there any additional thoughts or insights that you would  
**[0:49:41-0:49:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:41):**  like to share? Well, we always need to remember that mineral nutrition is an integrated system  
**[0:49:49-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:49):**  with the plus genetics and the environment. We talk about individual nutrients primarily  
**[0:49:58-0:50:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:58):**  under those situations where those nutrients may be limiting in the environment. But remember that  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:06):**  the plant is really a remarkable entity. If you want to look at it as a factory or as a  
**[0:50:14-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:14):**  biochemical process, it's truly remarkable how everything is integrated to such a  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:24):**  dynamic degree that it all relates together. Even though we look at individual nutrients  
**[0:50:33-0:50:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:33):**  and what their specific role is to understand how we can improve that efficiency, we can't  
**[0:50:42-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:42):**  usually just take one element and see all of the responses that we would potentially have without  
**[0:50:50-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:50):**  also making sure that the other support aspects, activities are also addressed.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:59):**  When we find that those are deficient. Great reminder. Just look at the whole picture in that  
**[0:51:06-0:51:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:06):**  and make sure that we're meeting the needs of the plant in those different areas and  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:14):**  different stages of growth. With our nutrition, the plant will actually do that on its own  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:21):**  physiologically. When it goes from vegetative to reproductive phase, you'll see a shift in  
**[0:51:28-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:28):**  the requirement or the need for different nutrients because of the different biochemical  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:36):**  processes that are being activated or suppressed at those particular stages.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:43):**  It's a very dynamic system, one that we can modify and change and to get the specific end product  
**[0:51:53-0:52:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:53):**  that we are really striving to produce to meet the needs of our society. We need to look for  
**[0:52:02-0:52:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:02):**  the specific elements that recognize that we can make a difference in the world.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:10):**  Specific elements that recognize that they're all part of an integrated system.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:18):**  Excellent reminder, Don. Thank you very much for joining us and for sharing your wisdom.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/season-2-kickoff-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:22):**  It's very much needed and very valuable. Thank you and we hope to have you back

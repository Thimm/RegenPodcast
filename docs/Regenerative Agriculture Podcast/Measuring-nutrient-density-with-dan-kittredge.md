### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 11:44:33)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:08):**  produce crops that are completely resistant to diseases and insects, and produce food  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:12):**  of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate conversation about growing  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:17):**  food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people with incredible knowledge and information about  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:22):**  soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:28):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to bring this knowledge together in a more  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:33):**  coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems that growers can easily  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:38):**  put into practice.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:40):**  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative agriculture systems become the mainstream  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:45):**  globally, the status quo against which all other growing systems are compared.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:49):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge that we have learned in the last  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:52):**  decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:55):**  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or topics that you would like for me to discuss,

**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:33):**  In 2013, my wife and I set out to make an inspirational film that spoke to the regenerative  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:39):**  agriculture movement.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:40):**  Early on, we met Marty Travis of Spence Farm, who would become our main character on a journey  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:46):**  through the seasons of producing food in a way that is not only good for people, but  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:51):**  good for the soil.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:53):**  Sustainable has since developed a cult following from those looking to reinvent the food system,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:58):**  and I invite you to check it out.

**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:54):**  Hi friends, welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:57):**  I'm here today with Dan Kittredge, who is the director of the Bio-Nutrient Food Association,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:02):**  the Real Food Campaign.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:03):**  Dan and I have known each other and been friends for probably a decade or more, right Dan?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:08):**  I would say at least, yeah.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:09):**  We've had lots of stories and shared adventures and we both share a passion for one of the  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:17):**  aspects of healthy food production, which is the capacity to produce food that is so  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:24):**  healthy that it can legitimately be considered food as medicine.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:29):**  So Dan, I'd love for the audience to hear more of your story.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:32):**  Tell us a little bit about your background and some of the memorable moments that led  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:36):**  you to the work that you're doing today.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:39):**  And thank you for having me on, Jon.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:42):**  It's been very impressive watching you over the past decade and everything you've done.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:46):**  My background is, I grew up on an organic farm in Massachusetts and my parents work  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:52):**  for and still do work for an organic farming organization called NOFA.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:56):**  And through my childhood teens and twenties, I would be managing the farm, sort of just  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:02):**  what I always had done.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:04):**  But when I got married and had found no other better way to raise a family, I thought than  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:09):**  a homestead, small farm, that lifestyle, I rapidly came to terms with the fact that I  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:15):**  didn't have the skills to make a living farming.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:19):**  Actually what caused farming to be so difficult economically in many cases was the fact that  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:25):**  the plants weren't healthy.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:26):**  And I got that insight from watching them be regularly attacked by insects and disease  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:34):**  year in, year out.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:35):**  And even though we thought we were doing a better job because we were using chemicals,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:38):**  our plants were obviously not healthy because they were suffering from things that plants  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:42):**  in nature don't regularly suffer from.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:44):**  And so that sort of set me on this track of learning how to do a better job, not is organic  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:50):**  better, but maybe what is better than organic.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:53):**  And that's where I met you at Acres in, I think it was 2006, maybe 2007.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:58):**  And yeah, from digging into it and learning some of the principles and practicing them  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:04):**  on the farm, it became clear very rapidly that it's not hard at all to modulate your  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:09):**  practices and dramatically increase plant health, which correlates with yield, which  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:14):**  correlates with soil health.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:16):**  And the thing that really struck me was the correlation to nutrient density.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:20):**  And that was a term that was really only just beginning to be contemplated.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:25):**  And I remember going around talking to all the elders, you know, Arden Anderson and Gary  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:30):**  Zimmer and Jerry Brunetti and Bruce Taneo, et cetera, et cetera, and saying, okay, you  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:34):**  guys are talking about bricks.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:35):**  You're talking about nutrient density.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:37):**  You know, this seems like it's a really big deal that nutrient levels vary in food.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:42):**  Where's the data?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:43):**  And there was no data.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:45):**  You know, it was sort of commonly held and assumed and you can test it with a refractometer,  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:50):**  but then there's no calibration for a refractometer to say what that means.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:53):**  So yeah, it seemed to me like this is a really powerful leverage point because people who  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:00):**  are buying food think they're buying food for health, for themselves to be, you know,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:05):**  doing well in their families.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:07):**  And if there's no way to know that the food you're buying is nutritious and in fact, many  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:12):**  times it's relatively empty, it seems like using nutrient density as a organizing point,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:19):**  as a high ground.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:20):**  You know, our thought is who is opposed to food being more nutritious?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:25):**  Is there anybody who has a problem with that?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:27):**  No, we don't need to be fighting food having low nutrient levels.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:31):**  We can be working together towards food having higher nutrient levels.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:35):**  And so, yeah, it's been a process over the past 10 years.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:38):**  We founded the organization, the BFA, to serve as a educational nonprofit that could work  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:44):**  with growers of all scales to help them understand what we call principles of biological systems.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:49):**  You know, I grew up in a community of organic farmers where we had an educational organization  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:54):**  and we shared and we came together and learned.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:57):**  And I didn't see anybody in the biological ag space running an organization doing that  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:02):**  educational work.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:03):**  It was primarily just consultants and, you know, there was no real open, deep dive into  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:09):**  these principles.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:10):**  And so we've been running the BFA now for 10 years and it's our mission is to increase  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:15):**  quality in the food supply and by quality, we mean flavor and aroma, nutrient levels,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:19):**  health giving attribute, local chapters in 15 different states across the US.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:24):**  We do an annual conference and we've had this vision of a spectrometer that we can give  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:29):**  to consumers so that they can actually at the point of purchase in the grocery store  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:34):**  or the farmers market assess this bag of carrots versus that bag of carrots or this milk versus  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:40):**  that milk and actually not just to consumers, but to farmers so they can see in the field  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:46):**  where your plants are at, how they're growing and for buyers and wholesalers and retailers  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:51):**  so they can make decisions for their supply chain based on nutritional value.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:54):**  Our thought is if we can organize an open framework of understanding that effectively  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:02):**  focuses on nutrient density, there's some amazing transformative effects that can occur.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:07):**  Dan, in that background, you mentioned a couple of pieces which I think are very important  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:11):**  for us to elaborate on.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:13):**  Certainly want to describe the work that you're doing with the conference and the instrument  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:19):**  that you're developing, but you made two connections that I think are perhaps not well  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:24):**  understood and the first is the connection between the presence of insects and diseases  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:30):**  and nutrient density.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:33):**  The second is the correlation between nutrient density, nutritional integrity and soil health  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:40):**  and also of course how that then ties to sequestering carbon and climate change.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:46):**  Those are two different aspects, but to the first point, I had a conversation with a fruit  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:51):**  grower in this last week who was of the persuasion that he is not spraying his fruit with any  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:59):**  pesticides and he has some coddling moth larvae in his apples.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:05):**  His point was that while the apples are good enough for the coddling moth, they're good  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:08):**  enough for people to eat as well.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:10):**  What would your response be to that?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:13):**  You and I have talked about this many, many times over the years, Jon.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:18):**  Your plant health pyramid is one of the easiest ways that people have access to for understanding  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:24):**  it.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:25):**  But I use the metaphor of a milk cow and a bale of hay.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:29):**  And I'm oftentimes in a workshop, I'm teaching a course and I'll say, if there was a bale  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:33):**  of hay sitting here in the room when you walked in, you might've considered sitting on it.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:38):**  And people say, yeah, sure.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:39):**  I said, but you probably would not have considered eating it.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:41):**  And they're like, yeah, yeah, that's true.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:43):**  And then I say, and if a milk cow had walked in and seen that bale of hay, she probably  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:47):**  would not have considered sitting on it, but she likely would have considered eating it.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:51):**  And we're like, yeah, that's true.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:52):**  So we have now here an example of a situation where something is food for one species, but  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:59):**  not food for another.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:00):**  Who's like, yeah, okay.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:01):**  That makes sense.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:02):**  And they say, we know that cows have four stomachs to digest complex cellulose and turn  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:06):**  it into functional nutrition because of their more evolved digestive tract.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:12):**  If you can understand that concept, which I don't think is very sophisticated, then  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:16):**  understand that the larvae of a Colorado potato beetle does not have a liver, does not have  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:21):**  the enzymes in its gut necessary to digest protein as an example.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:26):**  And so functionally when your plant is going through the process of building those higher  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:31):**  order compounds, the plant secondary metabolites out of the lipids, the fats and oils out of  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:36):**  the proteins, et cetera.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:38):**  If your plant is healthily building those higher order compounds, it is indigestible  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:43):**  to the fungi, to the larvae, to the beetles, to the bacterial and fungal spores.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:51):**  It's just physiologically those organisms can't digest a plant with the compounds that  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:57):**  we experience as flavor and aroma.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:00):**  If you have eaten a tomato that doesn't have much flavor, it doesn't have high levels of  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:05):**  those secondary metabolites.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:07):**  If you've eaten a tomato that does have a lot of flavor, it does have high levels of  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:09):**  those secondary metabolites.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:10):**  It's those compounds that correlate with flavor and aroma for us that actually make something  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:16):**  indigestible for an insect or a disease.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:21):**  So in brief, if something can be used as a food source by a Colorado potato beetle larvae  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:27):**  or by a cotyledon larvae or by a cabbage looper, then it's not fit for people to eat really  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:32):**  because it doesn't have those higher order metabolites that contribute health to us.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:37):**  That's what I say.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:38):**  I say it's in nature's report card and if it's insect food, it's insect food.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:44):**  If it's fungus food, it's fungus food.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:46):**  Only when you've got animal pests attacking your crops is nature telling you that you're  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:50):**  producing animal food.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:53):**  Then to the second point that you made, the connection between nutritional integrity and  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:59):**  soil health.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:01):**  How does nutrient density lead to improving soil health and vice versa?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:06):**  How does soil health lead to improving nutrient density?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:09):**  Well, nutrient density functionally is higher levels of more nutrients per unit volume.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:17):**  So more copper, more zinc, more potassium or calcium, there's levels in this ratio.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:23):**  So we want to have balanced ratios.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:26):**  But generally overall, it's higher levels of those elements.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:30):**  And then it's also higher levels of the polyphenols and antioxidants and things like that.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:35):**  And so the way nature works to build nutrients into a plant is through photosynthesis.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:42):**  The plant makes sugar in the leaves and injects it into the soil to stimulate the soil life,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:49):**  which then digest the soil and functionally are able to harvest nutrients from the soil  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:54):**  and bring them back up into the plant.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:56):**  The more sugar the plant is able to make, the more it's able to inject into the soil.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:02):**  The more carbon is taken from the atmosphere and put into the soil, the more sugars that's  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:06):**  put in the soil, the more microbes are fed, the greater the activity in the rhizosphere,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:12):**  the more nutrients that are able then to flow into the plant.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:15):**  And so it's this beautiful symbiotic relationship where as the plant flourishes, then the soil  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:20):**  life flourishes, and then the crop becomes more nutritious.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:24):**  And then whoever eats that becomes more nutritious.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:26):**  So it's a really simple and elegant and beautiful process, which I'm sure you've covered in  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:31):**  previous podcasts.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:32):**  Yeah, it is something that I've spoken about quite a bit.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:36):**  And I think the really important piece that has been missed historically is the contribution  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:44):**  of plants.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:45):**  And the way that I describe it is that if you did not have plants photosynthesizing  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:50):**  and contributing the carbon that they sequestered to the soil profile, the only thing that you  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:55):**  really have that would be considered soil is decomposed rock particles.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:00):**  It's really plants that contribute organic matter.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:03):**  So my contention is that it is healthy plants which create healthy soil and that they're  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:08):**  the engine that drives the system, not the other way around.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:11):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:12):**  I would concur.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:15):**  And plants can functionally wear out the soil, but it's really it's not the plants, it's  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:19):**  the management.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:20):**  That's a recurring theme.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:21):**  There's this theme in livestock grazing, regenerative grazing versus set stock grazing where they  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:29):**  talk about it's not the cow, it's the how.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:31):**  And what you're saying is essentially the same thing.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:33):**  It's not the crop, it's how the crop is managed.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:34):**  So you can manage crops which deplete organic matter and deplete biological activity, or  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:39):**  you can manage them in such a way that they enhance it.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:42):**  And depending on how those crops are managed, they are either good for you or not.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:46):**  So you know, take milk as an example, if it's a crop, depending on what the cow eats, that  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:53):**  milk either has healthy omega six, omega three ratios in it, or unhealthy omega six, omega  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:59):**  three ratios in it.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:00):**  Depending on how the cabbage was fertilized, it either has good levels of complete proteins  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:07):**  and brassicosins in it, or it's full of nitrates.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:11):**  And there's this concept that, oh, it's better to have the Mediterranean diet or the keto  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:17):**  diet or the I'm lactose intolerant or I'm this, I'm that.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:22):**  People seem to think that all carrots are basically the same.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:26):**  All milk is basically the same.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:27):**  All wheat is basically the same.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:29):**  And it's really, really not.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:31):**  And that's, I think the piece that we have been trying to bring forth with the BFA is  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:36):**  that the effect of that crop on your body has a lot to do with how it was produced.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:43):**  And so saying that, you know, I can't digest milk, or I can't digest wheat.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:48):**  Maybe you can't digest what's normally available in the supply chain, but if it was produced  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:53):**  well, you might be surprised at how your body responds.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:57):**  And can we help people select the better tomatoes, the better wheat, wherever it is that they  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:02):**  buy food?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:04):**  Because if we can help people do that, then we can apply an economic lever to the supply  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:09):**  chain, which incentivizes farmers to focus on quality and not on volume.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:13):**  Because right now, all of the economic incentives are on volume effectively.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:17):**  And you know, farmers need to make a living.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:20):**  And so they're going to follow the money.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:22):**  So this is the whole idea with the spectrometer is to effectively, you know, establish a new  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:27):**  framework for discernment.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:29):**  Dan, you've mentioned several points that tie together, I want to dig into a little  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:33):**  bit more deeply.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:34):**  Just now you made a very strong point that crops are not all produced the same.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:39):**  They have very different quality, very different levels of nutrient density.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:43):**  And earlier in our conversation, you made a point that the data doesn't really exist  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:49):**  and isn't really out there.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:50):**  So question I would have for you is, why do we desire to have higher or more balanced  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:56):**  nutritional density?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:58):**  And do we really know what that is?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:00):**  And what's the backstory?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:01):**  How can we how can we say those things without having the historical data?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:05):**  First question is, why does it matter?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:07):**  Why do we care?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:08):**  Well, because you are what you eat.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:11):**  And, you know, we have evolved these really sophisticated nutrient monitoring devices  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:16):**  inside of our own bodies called noses and tongues.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:19):**  And that's our animal instinct to tell us whether something is good for us or not.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:25):**  When people talk about their food not having much flavor and salt, sugar, fat, you know,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:30):**  all of the things that are added when food is processed to trick the nose and the tongue  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:34):**  into thinking that something is desirable when it's just the synthetic flavorings or  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:41):**  the corn oil or whatever it is in it, the salt, you know, our bodies require dozens  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:47):**  of different elements, billions of times a day, just for basic maintenance, copper, zinc,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:52):**  calcium, potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, chromium, molybdenum, you know, how many elements can  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:58):**  you name?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:59):**  And how many elements are actually in your food?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:03):**  When you don't have the basic nutrients that your body needs to function in your food,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:08):**  and you are building your body out of your food, then your body stops functioning.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:13):**  We are experiencing chronic illness at epidemic levels across the planet to a large degree  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:18):**  now in ways that didn't exist a couple generations ago.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:22):**  And there's a really nice connection there between the way the food is grown, what's  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:27):**  in the food, and what's in your body and how well your body functions.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:32):**  So you know, I've been saying for a while now, you know, it doesn't matter whether people  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:37):**  believe us or not, at some point, they're gonna stop functioning.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:40):**  And nature is in charge here.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:43):**  And there's biochemistry, there's enzyme systems, there's all kinds of really sophisticated  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:48):**  dynamics, which we probably don't have time to go into here in this conversation.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:52):**  But effectively, when you don't have in your food, what your body needs to function, your  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:57):**  body stops functioning.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:58):**  So that's why it's important is because you need it.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:01):**  It doesn't, I mean, I say to people, it doesn't really matter about the carbon thing.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:06):**  That's all nice in the atmosphere.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:08):**  What really matters is your health to most people and the health of your children.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:12):**  And so that's one piece there.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:15):**  And then the second question I think you asked was, if the data doesn't exist, how can we  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:21):**  be making these statements about variation?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:23):**  Let me just expand on that for a moment, Dan.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:25):**  I occasionally I see these posts that are something to the effect of oranges today contain  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:31):**  only 6% of the vitamin A, oranges made in our grandfather's generation or something  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:36):**  like that.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:37):**  And there have been different nutrients and different statistics quoted.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:40):**  So what I would love to hear more about is where did those statements come from?  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:47):**  And then how can that be contrasted with your point that the data doesn't really exist?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:51):**  Well, there's a couple actually really important points there.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:54):**  One of them is that all oranges today are not uniform.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:59):**  And all oranges in our grandparents' time were not uniform.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:02):**  So to say that oranges today have this in them and oranges 50 years ago had something  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:07):**  else in them is simplifying it to a degree that basically makes your statement ignorant.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:14):**  There's a really important point, which I think if we can get this one point conveyed  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:19):**  to people broadly, will dramatically change things.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:22):**  And that is that there is variation in food.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:26):**  We did this project last year having struggled with the fact that we couldn't find the data  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:31):**  sets that showed the variation in crops.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:34):**  We took 650 carrots from around the country, from grocery stores, from farmers markets,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:40):**  from farms.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:41):**  Some were organic, some were not.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:44):**  And different cultivars, different fertility programs, different management practices,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:48):**  different climate details.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:50):**  And we took all those carrots and we set up a lab and we ran them through the lab and  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:54):**  we tested for 25 different elements and then also for polyphenols and antioxidants.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:01):**  And the variation we found in the carrots depended on the element.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:06):**  In potassium, maybe it was 800%.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:10):**  And in copper, it was only 400%.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:12):**  Or in sulfur, it was 1500%.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:16):**  So what that means is there may be an eight to one variation within an element or a four  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:21):**  to one variation within an element depending on the best carrot or the worst carrot.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:25):**  But the issue really is not like all carrots now are equal.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:29):**  The issue is which is the best carrot I have to choose from?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:34):**  When we looked at things like antioxidants and polyphenols, it was 75 to one or 200 to  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:41):**  one, the variation levels in the end crops.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:43):**  And so-  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:44):**  So wow, we're not talking about 10 or 20 or even 50% variability.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:47):**  Those are some really significant numbers.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:50):**  400 to 1800% in the elements and 75 to 200,000, 75,000 to 200,000% variation in the secondary  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:59):**  metabolites.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:00):**  That's what we found.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:01):**  And that was just two crops.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:02):**  And we only looked at 27 different metrics.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:07):**  But the point is that you can't say all oranges today have this much vitamin C and all oranges  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:14):**  50 years ago had that much vitamin C.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:16):**  It's ignorant to make a statement that all oranges are the same.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:23):**  And that's the biggest issue we've got is people think that all carrots are the same,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:27):**  all milk is the same, and it's just not.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:29):**  How it was produced, what the genetics were, et cetera, is a massive import in the functional  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:35):**  nutrition in the crop.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:37):**  So I'm not sure if I answered your question specifically.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah, thanks for that review.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:43):**  And I think it would also be of interest to our listeners.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:45):**  I know you and I have had conversations about the historical data and the lack of thoroughness  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:51):**  and detail and integrity in the historical data from 40, 50, 60 years ago.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:55):**  Can you describe what the USDA data sets actually look like and how they've been developed?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:02):**  So if you get a bag of carrots now and you look on the back of it, it'll say this one  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:08):**  six inch carrot will give you 110% of your daily recommended vitamin A. For that statement  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:14):**  we made in the label.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:15):**  The point I just made is you can't make that statement because you didn't test the carrot  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:19):**  to see where it stands.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:20):**  You're just, you're basing it on an average.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:22):**  And that's what the USDA has done over time is they've developed averages.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:26):**  And so my understanding is that this is not on an annual basis, but every few years, depending  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:30):**  on what the crop is, they'll go around to grocery stores in 10 or 12 different parts  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:35):**  of the country.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:36):**  They'll buy carrots, say off the shelf, they'll send them to a lab.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:40):**  And then once they've taken those carrots off the shelf and assess them and they've  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:44):**  gotten their data back, they take the outliers, the 10% that were the best and the 10% that  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:50):**  were the worst.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:51):**  And they get rid of all that data.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:52):**  They throw it away.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:53):**  And then they find the average of the stuff in the middle.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:58):**  And then they say, okay, according to the USDA, this is what a carrot contains.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:03):**  So when people make statements about what was in oranges 50 years ago, what's in oranges  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:08):**  today, they're making statements based on that process that the USDA went through.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:13):**  So was the science done well in the 1940s, 1950s?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:17):**  I think it was done pretty well.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:18):**  I can't speak to that to a great degree.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:21):**  The whole point is it's assuming what's in the grocery stores, which is the stuff that's  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:25):**  produced generally in the larger farms, in many cases, not well.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:30):**  And so that average, that USDA average of what's in a carrot or what's in an orange,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:35):**  what we found when we looked at our full data was that was probably around the 15th or 20th  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:41):**  percentile of what was possible.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:43):**  What the USDA calls average is in the 20th percentile.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:47):**  There's some stuff that's worse than that, but there's a whole bunch of space that's  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:51):**  better than that, what this carrot could consist of.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:55):**  So I feel like we're getting a little bit heady with statistics and data and science.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:01):**  And this is the kind of thing that sometimes is better conveyed with some kind of a graphic.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:06):**  But the basic point is how you grow something has a massive effect on what's in it.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:12):**  We did this about eight years ago.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:14):**  We had a project with, we had the Biodynamic Association on one side and Cornell on the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:18):**  other.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:19):**  And we got some seeds from Johnny's, some carrot seeds of different types, red cord  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:24):**  chanthanas and boleros.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:25):**  And we sent those seeds, we bought one pound of bolero seed and split it up and sent an  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:32):**  ounce to 16 different farms around the country and said, you guys, please just grow these  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:37):**  seeds in your soil and then send the carrots back to us.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:41):**  And they did.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:42):**  And we found again, that massive variation in the carrots, they were the same seeds from  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:48):**  the same bag grown in different soil.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:50):**  And the nutrient variation was massive.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:52):**  I think you've made the point very clearly that there is significant nutrient variation  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:57):**  based on management, based on how a crop is grown.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:00):**  The next question that leads from this is of course, growers, particularly the audience  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:07):**  for this podcast, people who really care about producing healthy plants that are resistant  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:12):**  to diseases and insects desire to be able to monitor that in the field and to actually  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:16):**  know, what is the nutritional profile of the crops that they're producing?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:20):**  Do they have the capacity to resist diseases and insects and how can they produce healthy  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:26):**  food for people?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:28):**  How do we measure that?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:31):**  Well, this gets to the actual work we're doing.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:34):**  You know, we've been talking for a few minutes now about the theory and the principle, but  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:39):**  you know, most farmers like to actually get the job done.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:43):**  So you and I both grew up on farms and are, you know, have that farmer spirit, I think.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:48):**  For me, when I started to put all these pieces together 10 years ago, you know, and having  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:53):**  watched my parents write some of the first organic standards in the country in 1980s  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:59):**  and watched how certification systems worked and labeling systems worked.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:03):**  It seemed to me that that structure was flawed to begin with.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:08):**  The way organic works as an example is you're either are organic or you're not organic.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:12):**  It's a binary.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:13):**  It's a black and white.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:15):**  And what we just got done discussing was that crop nutrient levels, nutrient density in  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:19):**  crops is anything but binary.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:21):**  It is a continuum.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:23):**  You're either on the 10th percentile or the 30th percentile or the 50th percentile.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:27):**  And so you can't really have a certification label that provides that information.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:33):**  What we really want to do is we want to give people the ability to see for themselves in  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:37):**  real time.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:38):**  Like I want to see between these three bags of carrots on the shelf, the Bunny Love, the  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:42):**  Cal Organic and the Bolt House farms, which ones are better.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:45):**  I'm in a farmer's market.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:47):**  I want to choose which farm to buy from based on the nutritional value of the crops that  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:51):**  they've got on the stand.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:52):**  And the way that you would be able to do that is through a process called spectroscopy.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:58):**  When I'm explaining spectroscopy to people, I say, so we know that, you know, Alpha Centauri  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:02):**  is a star that's, you know, whatever, six light years away.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:07):**  And we humans have never sent any any probes, any, you know, starships or whatever past  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:13):**  the edge of the solar system, which is a light maybe 12 hours away.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:17):**  But the scientists, the astrophysicists are like really confident that Alpha Centauri  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:22):**  is made up of 51 percent hydrogen, 48 percent helium, one percent other gases in these levels  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:27):**  and ratios.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:28):**  Like, even though it's five light years away or six light years away, we know exactly what  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:32):**  it's made up of.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:33):**  And we did not figure that out by going there and sampling it.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:36):**  We figured that out by reading the light that came off of it.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:39):**  And this is what spectroscopy is basically is that every element in chemistry vibrates  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:45):**  at a certain frequency, basically makes a certain kind of light.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:48):**  Every compound in chemistry, you know, protein or lipids vibrates in physics and effectively  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:55):**  puts out a certain kind of light.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:57):**  And so our basic idea is to build a spectrometer that a consumer can hold in their hand, which  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:04):**  they can take to the grocery store or to the farmers market and flash a light at the crop.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:09):**  And by reading the light that bounces back, discern functionally how good that crop is.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:15):**  And that was an idea that we had, you know, six or eight years ago.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:19):**  But technically, it wasn't possible with the sort of rapid improvement in smartphones over  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:27):**  the last 10 years.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:29):**  It now is possible to really build that miniaturized consumer priced spectrometer in scale.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:36):**  It wasn't something that we could have done eight years ago, but it is something we can  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:40):**  do now.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:41):**  And so, you know, it's one thing to give the consumer the ability to test and use that  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:46):**  as our sort of our truth mechanism, because in my experience from looking at the data,  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:53):**  you know, there's a bunch of organic that's not very good.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:56):**  And there's a bunch of stuff at farmers markets that's also not very good.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:00):**  You can't say buy local and it's going to be more nutritious.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:03):**  You can't say buy organic and it's going to be more nutritious.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:05):**  It has everything to do with the farmer and how that farmer produced.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:08):**  And so it's one thing to have a tool for the consumer, but what we really want to accomplish  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:14):**  as part of this process is a tool for the grower as well.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:19):**  When you and I have talked about this a lot, if the grower had the ability with some basic  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:24):**  background information to, you know, like what your soil type, what your fertility program,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:29):**  which cultivar, what your climate data, if the grower had the ability to flash a light  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:35):**  at the leaf of the plant while it's growing the tomato, the oat, the corn, whatever it  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:40):**  is and get assessments of what's going on in that plant, then they could change their  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:45):**  fertility program in real time.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:47):**  And instead of the farmers basically being concerned about, oh, when I bring my crops  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:52):**  to market, what are they going to say?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:53):**  The farmer can basically in fields modulate fertility during the growing season so that  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:58):**  they can be ensured that when they bring their crops to market, they're going to be in the  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:02):**  10th percentile.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:03):**  So yeah, from a very practical standpoint, this is, you know, something that we can be  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:09):**  doing now.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:10):**  Dan, from the work that you are doing on this now, you said that it is now possible.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:15):**  It wasn't possible eight years ago.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:17):**  From your perspective, how far away are we from having a tool like that in the hands  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:22):**  of consumers and in the hands of growers?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:25):**  Well, our first prototype tool is available now.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:31):**  People can order them and get them shipped to them.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:32):**  There's a bit of a back order, a couple of months, but they're available.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:37):**  The data collection we're doing this year for the lab is such that by this winter, we  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:42):**  will have calibrations for six crops, cherry tomatoes, grapes, carrots, lettuce, spinach,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:48):**  and kale.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:49):**  Those are the six crops we're testing this year.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:52):**  And so as far as a, like a generation one proof of concept functioning tool that a consumer  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:58):**  can use in the grocery store, it looks like we're going to have it this winter.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:03):**  It's a generation one tool.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:06):**  It's not slick.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:08):**  It's not mass producible.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:09):**  It's nowhere near as sophisticated as we'd like it to be.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:12):**  And so I just want to be clear about that.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:15):**  We do have something that will be functional in the next couple of months, but what you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:19):**  and I have talked about is something that's much more systemic.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:22):**  When I first started making this pitch to people about this concept, one of the people  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:26):**  I talked to was a regional buyer for Whole Foods.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:28):**  For the North Atlantic region, everything from sort of Washington, DC up the East Coast  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:33):**  was in his purview and he was the buyer for fruits and vegetables and perishables basically.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:39):**  And I said, you know, you guys have a reputation for having superior quality Whole Foods.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:42):**  Why don't you work with us on this so your consumers can see that you do have a better  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:45):**  quality?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:46):**  And they said, no, no, we're not going to do that.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:50):**  Because they knew enough to know that they really weren't that much better than the competition.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:54):**  But what he did say to me, it always has stuck out to me was when you're two years out from  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:59):**  being able to do this, please come tell us because we will give our growers two years  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:04):**  to meet standard.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:05):**  And I would say where we stand right now, we can safely say two years from now, we're  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:11):**  going to have a mass produced consumer tool available in thousands or tens of thousands  
**[0:33:17-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:17):**  per month with more sophisticated tools in the hands of farmers to be doing this sort  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:25):**  of monitoring and management.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:26):**  I think two years is where we're at right now.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:29):**  So I'm really excited.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:30):**  This has been something I've been working on for more than a decade.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:33):**  And we're really close to this to a very significant, I think it's a paradigm shift, really, in  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:40):**  the way food is understood.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:43):**  It is really significant.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:44):**  And I think for those of you listening to the conversation that Dan and I have had,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:47):**  it's my understanding that the tool that will be available for professional use for growers  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:54):**  and agronomists, etc., will have obviously, it's a completely new tool, new libraries,  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:59):**  new calibrations have to be developed for it.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:02):**  But once those calibration libraries are developed, there are limits, of course, but from an agronomic  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:07):**  perspective, we will be able to measure everything we would have the desire to measure full mineral  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:12):**  profile, amino acid profile, proteins, peptides, carbohydrate profile, lipids, hormones, the  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:19):**  list kind of just goes on and on without end.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:21):**  This could be a really incredible management tool.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:24):**  And anybody who engages in the process of learning and sharing is going to obviously  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:28):**  have a leg up, because they're going to be able to modulate their practices, add different  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:33):**  foliar sprays, whatever it is that seems to be recommended.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:38):**  If you can assess in real time what is going on and make decisions, management decisions  
**[0:34:43-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:43):**  accordingly, the implications for the health of your plants, your cost of production, your  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:51):**  yields, your economic viability are extremely positive.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:55):**  This leads to the next step, which is that farmers would also be able to identify the  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:00):**  level of quality of the crops that they are producing, and possibly market them as such.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:06):**  I think it's something that we all need to be thinking about and be prepared for.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:11):**  So then, to the comment or the quote that you referenced for the Whole Foods buyer of  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:20):**  needing to give farmers two years to meet standard, you suggested just now that we're  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:24):**  about two years away.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:26):**  From your perspective, what is it that growers and farmers need to do to be prepared?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:30):**  Well, our plan is to really significantly engage this in-field data collection process  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:37):**  this year, this coming 2020.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:39):**  So with the BFA, as part of our broader collaboration, we're part of this group that's called Open  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:43):**  Team, which is a big open farm data management platform, basically, where you can input your  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:49):**  soil type and your fertility program and your management practices and your weather data  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:56):**  and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:58):**  The more we're able to share what's going on in our farms, the faster we're going to  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:05):**  be able to learn together what works and what doesn't work.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:09):**  There's a deeper conversation here about science and how it's been done and what can be understood  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:17):**  and what can't be understood.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:18):**  I've been struggling with this broader question for a long time, as I've said, and it was  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:23):**  sort of really flabbergasting to me that no one had actually built out the data sets to  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:28):**  show what the variation was in food quality.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:31):**  And it was probably three or four years ago now when I was down at the headquarters of  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:35):**  the ARS, Agriculture Research Service, which is a part of the USDA in Beltsville, Maryland.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:41):**  And I was talking to these national program leaders and I said, basically, we think there's  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:45):**  a connection between soil health and plant health and human health.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:48):**  And they said, stop right there.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:50):**  Before you go any further, we do too.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:52):**  A and B is too complicated and we're never going to figure it out.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:56):**  Now, what do you want to talk about?  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:58):**  And I was like, you're the USDA.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:03):**  You grant that there's a connection between soil health and plant health and human health  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:06):**  and you have given up on trying to figure out how it works.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, that's where they're at.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:12):**  And that's because effectively biological systems have so many different factors.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:18):**  How many different species of microbes are there in your soil?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:22):**  What are the epigenetics of the seed that you're planting?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:26):**  You can't control all the factors.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:29):**  And the way that agronomic research has been done for decades now has been a single factor  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:34):**  analysis.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:36):**  Randomized replicated trials will just change one thing in these 12 little plots and then  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:42):**  repeat and see what we can find.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:44):**  Is it calcium or is it potassium or whatever?  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:47):**  It's impossible to just change one thing in agricultural systems.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:52):**  Well, that's the whole point is that it's a constantly moving ecosystem of dynamics.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:58):**  And the only really real way to tease out what's going on is to have a framework where  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:04):**  every farm can functionally be a research farm.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:07):**  Where if we have hundreds or thousands of farms that are collecting common data about  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:13):**  their environmental conditions, about their management practices, and then they're sending  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:16):**  in their crops to a lab to be assessed, all of a sudden we've got this, what's called  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:21):**  a metadata set, where we've got hundreds or thousands of farms each submitting hundreds  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:26):**  or thousands of data points.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:28):**  And then you can look for patterns.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:30):**  And so what I would suggest is that farmers get engaged in this process.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:36):**  The sooner you're engaged, the sooner you have your data, you're beginning to collect  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:42):**  it as part of this broader collaborative, the sooner we're going to be able to feed  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:47):**  recommendations back to you and say, it looks like this is a limiting factor in your farm.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:52):**  Looks like this issue can be addressed in this fashion.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:56):**  So that's what we're doing.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:57):**  Dan, where can growers go to learn more about the work that you're doing at the BFA and  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:03):**  your various efforts?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:04):**  Well, our basic website is bio nutrient.org.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:08):**  We have tens of hours, hundreds of hours of recordings from our conferences on YouTube.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:15):**  If you just look under bio nutrient, we've got a channel there.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:20):**  The research work, the data collection and the collaboration and the lab and everything  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:25):**  else is under the URL realfoodcampaign.org.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:30):**  And our annual conference is soilandnutrition.org.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:35):**  That's coming up in November on the 14th to the 17th.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:40):**  I know you've had a really exceptional conference in the past.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:42):**  I'm sure you'll have a great lineup of speakers again.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:44):**  We do have a great lineup of speakers.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:48):**  Not many of them are famous, but they all have really deep insights.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:52):**  Yeah, it's a wonderful curation process every year.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:57):**  I'm bringing together and it's not just agronomy, we have one track that is agronomy all the  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:02):**  way through the conference.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:03):**  We've got one track that is nutrition.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:06):**  Another track, I think we're calling it biochemistry and consciousness.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:10):**  Sort of looking at how the vibration of the compounds in your body functionally affects  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:17):**  your ability to tune into your higher nature.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:22):**  Another track on systemic solutions.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:25):**  So whether it's economics or the environment or politics, what are ways that we can actually  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:32):**  systemically engage in building the solutions we're looking for?  
**[0:40:35-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:35):**  So yeah, it's a really nice community and just the average level of knowledge and insight  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:44):**  of attendees is, I find it remarkably high.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:47):**  So it's a great way to be energized and inspired if you want to be surrounded by some really  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:54):**  inspiring people, it's a good place to go.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:57):**  The impetus for this conversation between Dan and I here on the podcast came as a result  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:04):**  for all those of you regular podcast listeners, you know that a few episodes ago I interviewed  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:09):**  Vern Peterson alive at the Healthy Soil Summit in California.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:15):**  And Vern really encouraged me to begin developing standards for what defines quality in fruit.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:23):**  And I've been having this ongoing conversation with Dan for over a decade.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:27):**  And Vern's comment really reminded me of the need to prioritize and focus on defining quality  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:35):**  and quality standards, what they really mean for human health, what they could mean for  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:39):**  growers.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:41):**  And so in our work at Advancing Eco-Agriculture, we are beginning to work much more closely  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:46):**  with Dan and the Bio-Nutrient Food Association, the Real Food Campaign to both develop these  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:50):**  tools that Dan is working on and to define what quality really means and then also define  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:56):**  how they get there.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:57):**  So I'm very excited and very much looking forward to that Dan, it's going to be a lot  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:00):**  of fun.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:01):**  It feels like it's coming together now.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:04):**  And I also owe a big thank you to Vern Peterson for that encouragement and that push to get  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:11):**  the ball rolling.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:12):**  So thank you Vern.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/measuring-nutrient-density-with-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:13):**  Dan, thank you very much for being here and for having this conversation.

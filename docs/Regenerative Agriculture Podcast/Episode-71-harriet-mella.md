### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 15:24:39)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast where we talk  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:04):**  about the agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate soil health  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  and plant health, that regenerate ecosystems, that regenerate the economic health of farmers,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:14):**  and ultimately that also regenerate public health as well. My guest for today's episode is Harriet  
**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  Mella who I am absolutely delighted to have here and to introduce to all of you. Harriet is one of  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  those rare individuals who is very widely read and all the different fringe sciences that connect to  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  agronomy and to agriculture and was able to connect the dots in a really beautiful way.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  I've known Harriet for a number of years and I've really enjoyed the conversation  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  that we have had talking about all the different science areas. So today is going to be an awesome  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  conversation. Hang on to your hats. You're probably going to hear about 20 things that  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  you've never heard about before and you will enjoy every minute of it. So Harriet, thank you for being  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  here. Can you tell us a little bit about your story and the context of your growing experiences  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  and some of the things that you're fascinated by and that you're working on? Hi John, thanks for  
**[0:01:09-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  having me on the podcast. So I think if I try to find the one major line of all my agronomical  
**[0:01:19-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  experiences it's taste, simply taste. I have been with 18, I've spent a year in Australia woofing  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  and that's where I have been on the vegetable farm of Deadly Fredericks in the area of Brisbane  
**[0:01:36-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  and I have come in contact with fantastic vegetable taste. And so afterwards when I  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  got back home some years passed and I started to put together a self-sufficient garden,  
**[0:01:51-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:51):**  nothing tasted well at all. And the beans were stringy and everything, nothing worked basically.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  And I had grown up with a garden crazy mother on a sandy soil and here I was on a very silty  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:08):**  compacted soil and just nothing worked, nothing. And at first I thought it's a question of modern  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  varieties. So this is when I went on the quest for heirlooms and after having fiddled around  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  with them for some years I realized there is another part to the story. And this is how I  
**[0:02:27-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:27):**  got into culture methods and eventually I stumbled over the materials of Master Cho, this Korean  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  natural farming. And I had picked up at that time already a cooperation with Mark Christensen in New  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  Zealand about heirloom tomatoes which were screened for the highest values of this orange  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  lycopene, this tetrasys lycopene, which is absorbed easier in the intestinal tract and  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  apparently powerful metabolite against cancer. They were working with prostate cancer at that  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  time and we were looking at tremendous variations in the content of this metabolite in the tomatoes.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  This is how I got transferred to John Kemp by Mark. And so I began to connect the dots between  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:22):**  the things I knew from university, from biology,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  transferring them or connecting them to the field experiences I got and slowly and slowly improving  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  the product of my garden so my children would start to eat it as well. And not say, oh, mama,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  can't you go to the supermarket and buy some pumpkins there?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  So when you approach plant development from the perspective of taste and flavor,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  you described how you worked with heirloom tomatoes and some of these varieties. But  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  I know that you've also done some work with breeding or perhaps breeding is not the right  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  word, but you've made some observations about changes in epigenetic expression and how plants  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  begin expressing themselves differently when they have optimal nutrition and are supported with a  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  healthy microbiome. Can you tell us a little bit about what you have been doing with the  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  can you tell us a little bit about what you have observed there and what you've experienced?  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  Yeah, actually, I have, I have some breeding projects with heirlooms around. I've been working  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  with peas, you know, these very large snow peas, 16 centimeter long pods, these things,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  and pumpkins. That's my favorite ones. But the biggest change of perception I had in the last  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  years was how powerful epigenetic modifications are in heirlooms, especially. I mean, I have also  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  had some hybrids around, but the problem with the hybrids is that they're not allowed to learn.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  They cannot pass on the experience they make with the spot and the conditions they're growing at to  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  the next generations. So many things that you can observe in heirlooms, if you repeat or reproduce  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  them for several generations, you will never see in a hybrid. So I am extremely surprised because  
**[0:05:20-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  I do not find anything about that, about two things. One is the vividness, a plant deals with  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  the triggers that come from the outside. For example, solar tracking. If you have heirlooms  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  that are reasonably happy and they have microbes around their roots, you will see leaf movements  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  that you have never seen before. If you have, for example, leaves with single leaflets,  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  the patio between the leaflets will bend in itself towards the light to catch it.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  You see the whole leaf move up and down, you see petioles move. And this is in both directions.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  You have avoidance, for example, of light, depending on the inner metabolic status of plant,  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  or you have better catchment. And I was really surprised. The only thing that I found in  
**[0:06:22-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:22):**  literature about that is that a bad potassium status causes light to move up and down.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  Light avoidance reaction in the leaf. But all the other things and the speed and the extent of that,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  I have never found much about that. I found some hints in biodynamic literature where they call  
**[0:06:45-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  that plant gestures, but not in the scientific layer. And the other thing is that I'm really  
**[0:06:55-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  surprised about is the flexibility of plant architecture, depending on microbiome, nutrition,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  and also these zodiac rhythms that are described in biodynamics. Nutrition, you have probably heard  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  a lot about that from John's webinars, like the Hidden Hunger one. It is when you see,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  for example, the number of plant organs at one node. This is highly dependent on plant happiness  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:32):**  or nutritional status, and it changes with the generations. For example, I have seen this year,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  the first time, pumpkins that branch immediately from the node where the first leaf, the cotyledo,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  is at. They immediately branch at both sides and immediately they produce and that branch flowers.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:55):**  They have flower buds there. Wow. So they would be flowering within a few days after  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  germination at that rate. Yeah. If everything runs smoothly, yeah. I thought, this is impressive.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  Or several buds like double or even triple crown flowers and peppers. I have seen that  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  happening last year first. Yeah. Peppers are one of those plants that are only supposed to have  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  one plant or one flower per node. No, I've seen, it looks weird. It is there in one row.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  They're not beside each other, but they're underneath each other. And as always, if  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  something changed and the plant becomes unhappy, they just shed the flower, the additional one.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  So seeing it doesn't mean that you have a fruit or pumpkins with three female flowers in one node.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:45):**  I have never seen that before. It's just begun to appear in the last years.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  So this is really intriguing. You use the expression that it looks weird and it only  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  looks weird because it's not normal for us to see this type of expression. And I'll repeat a phrase  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  that I've used many, many times, which is that we don't actually know what really healthy plants  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  look like anymore because many of our crops are not supported with the nutrition in the microbiome.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  So what are some of the practices that you have been using to bring about these changes  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  in epigenetic expression and to bring about this multi-flowering and multi-branching expression?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  Wait a second. I would like to come back to that weird. There is developments that you look at  
**[0:09:34-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  and you perceive immediately as harmonious. If it is symmetric, if it is rounded, if it is balanced,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  immediately look at that and you accept it. For example, I have seen the first time last year  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:50):**  eggplants with two first genuine leaves instead of one in some heirloom lines. Or this year,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  this year first pumpkin with two first genuine leaves. And this is something you really,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  you accept it at once. But when you see, for example, an eggplant with four flowers and one  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  sits in the spot where you usually would expect it, and then you have two or three on a little stem  
**[0:10:19-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  beneath it and they just stick out in a weird angle. You think, this is not perfect yet, but  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  I will see where this is going to. So what you're describing, what you're explaining is that you  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  believe this is a step towards a greater state, a higher state of perfection, that this is an  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  intermediary step. I think I may have even shared on the blog some photos that we had of a grower  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  we were working with with eggplants that had four blossoms per node that were all on the same stem,  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  all on a single stem. Yeah, for example, when I saw peas very often are treated like closed  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:03):**  inflorsense, like the number of flowers in this inflorsense is fixed, full stop. And then  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  in some years they had a tiny little stem coming up on top and it was just pointing out empty,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  you know, just a stick. And then a third flower began to appear there afterwards. So you see that  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  this takes some generations to happen, but all of a sudden it's there. And then you see three  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  flowers appear like they had been always there. And then on the three flower inflorsense, you see  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  that little stick appearing on the top. So I don't have the idea anymore that this is a closed thing  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  and that's it. So I think this begs the question, if you are observing plants changing their  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  expression through epigenetics from one generation to the next, what do the possibilities look like?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  What really is the future potential? I think it's totally open. I mean, if you can  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  multiply a flower per inflorsense and if you can multiply the number of inflorsense per node,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  and if you can go down in the node with a time of initiation of reproduction,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  it's totally open. And also the delay of senescence. I have seen that in the beginning  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  or bolting, you know, in the beginning I was seeing premature bolting all the time. It was a nightmare.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:38):**  And then you see all of a sudden this year, for example, we had frost until nearly now.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  And I've had broccoli. I put it out in the end of February. We had a very brief but very warm period.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:50):**  And I thought it would be like all the years before. So I put these guys out there and  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  they were looking perfect. You know, I was really proud of them. This is also a breeding project  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  I had run. And then I thought, well, that's it. They're going to bolt. No, they don't. They have  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  been hit by frost for six weeks every night. They did not bolt. There they are perfect.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  They're growing. They're beautiful. They're waxy. And I think, wow, I've never seen that before.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  So also the other end, you know, the prolongation or the resistance, sometimes it works, you know.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  This reminds me of your story about the peas and forming multiple  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  inflorescence per node reminds me of an experience that we have with a soybean grower some number of  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  years ago where these were actually also open pollinated genetics on soybeans. And he ended up  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  harvesting well over 90 bushels per acre of soybeans. And the reason for the high yield  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:56):**  was because he had a range of between 20 and 24 pods per node with nodes spaced about two inches  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  apart. Where the normal is two, maybe three pods per node, what is considered to be normal.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:10):**  Well, also what I see is that volunteers of plants appear that in the beginning I never saw,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  you know, like bean volunteers and our climate or soybean volunteers. I was really surprised  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  when I got the first ones. Usually they rot away in the winter. So these plants are actually  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  germinating in your, you're saying that your soil expression has changed so much that these seeds  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  are germinating there without you planting them. Yes. Some, some beds, you know, I want to be  
**[0:14:39-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:39):**  honest. Some I'm still after all this observation and studying, I'm still far away to really fully  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  understand why a certain spot is developing in one direction and the other is falling back.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  I have my ideas, but I'm still not controlling that to the extent I would like to, honestly.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:03):**  So tell us about some of your ideas. Why do you think this might be happening?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  Okay. One that I've seen that it's extremely beneficial for soils is senescent perennials.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  So if the root of multi-year plants senesce in the spot and rot in this spot, it improves the  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  texture of the soil tremendously. Like parsnips or carrots or whatever, you know, when, when you're  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:36):**  a seed gardener, of course you replicate them in the second year. And the best improvement of a bed  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  I've ever seen was after a parsnip crop that I just left, you know, I took the, the tops off and  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  I left the parsnips in the soil to rot over winter. And in the spring, I was there with this  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  black earth teeming with worms, structure, perfect everything. I thought, wow, that was one experience  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  that made me really change. And for example, when I did the carbon course and I had to look at the  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:09):**  material of Christine Jones, she is propagating that idea to saying that perennials, even if you  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:15):**  cultivate them only as an annual, for example, in green manures, they will change a lot in the soil  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  because they have just, or I have read a lot about that now. They do different exudate patterns.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:30):**  They have different fruit set up and all this. So they are very, very important for soils.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:37):**  So I want to go back to the question that we missed when we were talking about weird or about  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  the changes in expression. What have you shifted and changed in your growing conditions to bring  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  about these changes in expression? I think the main overall change is that I got rid of the very  
**[0:16:58-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:58):**  bad compaction that I used to have in the beginning and that I intuitively have sequestered carbon.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:09):**  That's the second. The third is that I have begun to play with light to buy on microbes as  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:19):**  Annie-Français recommends it. I've just tried. The fourth is that I have changed the way I compost or  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  I got the hang of it a bit eventually. And I think one very important practice too was to begin with  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  folio feeding. And what I have done since the beginning is to work with the Zodiac rhythms as  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  I had picked up from Fettler-Fredricks. And of course I have now and then worked with  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  the biodynamic preparations. He always said, oh, keep doing it, keep doing it. It takes a couple  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  of years until you will see the effect, but keep going with it. So I have done it. And in the end,  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:03):**  it's the problem that you very often do not know exactly what has produced that shift.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  And if it's possible to produce the shift with a single method, or if you have to apply the whole  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  bundle. And you can tell that apart in the end. I'd like to touch a little bit on and learn a bit  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  more about the Zodiac rhythms. So I know that with our SAP analysis data collection, for example,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:31):**  we've observed very clear correlations between the plant's capacity to absorb nutrients and  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  lunar rhythms, where we see this very clear 28 day cycle where two weeks are average. One week is  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  exceptionally good where the plant absorbs nutrients very readily, very quickly. And one  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:49):**  week is very bad. Plants do not respond as strongly at all in that week to nutrient applications,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  nor does it appear that they are absorbing nutrients from the soil nearly as well during  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  that one week period. I'm aware of the work that was done by Maria Toon in biodynamics on  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:04):**  the Zodiac rhythms, but I've personally never experimented with it or evaluated what  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  differences are produced. Do you have any insights that you can share with us?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  Yes, many. The problem with these biodynamic methods is very often that they have a certain  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  vocabulary. And if you can't cope with that vocabulary, you think that this is junk. And  
**[0:19:32-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  I had seen in Australia that the plants were just behaved extraordinarily well. They just did what  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  they were supposed to. They did not bolt prematurely. They just developed that part of  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  the plant that was supposed to develop. And at that time, Detlef Friedrichs was working with  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  hybrids. It was only later that he switched also to heirlooms a bit, but I just was impressed.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  Wow. It was really interesting because when I went to university, I would have liked to work with  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  these lunar rhythms and I was turned down. I said, no, we are not touching that topic.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  You have only one reputation to lose. And I was really surprised that only recently in the Bocu  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  in Vienna, that's a soil university in Vienna, a young woman, she has investigated the Toon work  
**[0:20:30-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  in the university context and she could reproduce a lot of that. Some things not as beautiful as  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  in the Toon context, but basically it works. And I quite liked that, of course.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:50):**  The thing is, I think we can deduce some hints from the frame conditions that Maria Toon points  
**[0:20:57-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  out where she says, okay, no irrigation, low salt conditions. So that means no crude fertilizer,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  neither inorganic high salt conditions nor raw organic fertilizers. And then you need a basic  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:15):**  stable humic content. I think it was 2.5% or something, or at least 2%.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  And I'm not talking of just fresh free material chucked on, but really  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  stable bound humic substances. And this is when these rhythms begin to emerge.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:35):**  When I was thinking about that for the course, and I thought, how can we translate these things into  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  ordinary language? One thing that I hit was that high salt conditions in the soil, they just  
**[0:21:50-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  flocculate organic matter in solutions. So microorganisms cannot work as they should,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  or as they would like to with the organic material in soil solution, if you have high salt conditions.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  So that's one thing that's crucial. And the other thing is, Alec Podolinski, he reports in  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  one of his books that we're working with Schlieren optic. That's a very, very sensitive method  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:22):**  where you have a slide, a special slide from quartz glass, and you have your water that you  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  want to test or your liquid that you would like to test. And then you drop into this liquid  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  at the drops. And you have a look at the patterns that begin to resonate in this slide under the  
**[0:22:41-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  microscope. And there comes a point where the thing becomes chaotic. And the number of drops  
**[0:22:50-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  you can drop into that dish. And these patterns are not disturbed, tell you about this inner order  
**[0:22:59-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  in that liquid test. So Podolinski says you cannot do these measurements if you have a transition  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  from one zodiac sign, the moon in one zodiac sign to the other. If that happens while you do your  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  measurement, you can throw it out of the window, will not work. What I think is that somehow there  
**[0:23:21-0:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  is a connection between these lunar rhythms and water superstructure. So if you have a look,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:31):**  there is a nice little review of Mey-Wun Ho about water superstructures. And what I expect one day  
**[0:23:40-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  to be found is that zodiac rhythms will preferentially give rise to one of these  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  superstructures in relation to others. So what they have seen is that these superstructures  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  persist in a solution of bulk water. So you have them in there, they look like little rods or like  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  whatever clouds or and you have them in this bulk water and they have really interesting properties  
**[0:24:16-0:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  and these properties they differ from the bulk water. So what I expect to happen is that if you  
**[0:24:26-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:26):**  have or if you touch this plant soil water interaction and this is one thing that the  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  tune state, they state if you have to open the soil and have to work with the soil, you have to  
**[0:24:40-0:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  open up the structure otherwise you will not see this change. And also irrigation will level out  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:49):**  these rhythms. So I'm really sure that has to do something with water. And if you look there is a  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:55):**  bunch of research about water that has been treated either with magnetic fields or whatever  
**[0:25:03-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  electromagnetic fields you can imagine. And many of them promote plant growth but not all.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:14):**  And some of these treatments that you see that the water will stress the plant. Also the problem is  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  that in all these researches upping the plant growth is not necessarily a better quality.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  So the outcome of the study is very often is not comparable. But if you can read a bit in between  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  the lines and you are lucky and metabolites have been investigated as well. For example,  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  if you see that strawberries that have been treated with this or that magnetic water,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  all of a sudden begin to accumulate fructains, then you know, oh, this plant has been stressed  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:50):**  and has really been severely stressed by this water. I mean, this topic is endless. There is  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  sound for example has been shown to be beneficial for plant growth. No one has a clue how it works.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  I think it all comes back in the end to the interaction with water. You have sound frequencies  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  that resonate with water well. And you have windows of frequencies that do not.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  And what I think is that all these impulses, they will influence the water and the water  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  in the plant, which in turn will influence enzyme activity through the changed behavior of the water.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  Either that it differs in electron conductivity or whatever. You know, hydrophobic surfaces have  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  a coating of water vapor. And in this coating of water vapor, for example, electrons show  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  totally different behavior. They can be transferred in a zip. It's just a lot easier than in solution.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  I think what happens is that if we have these different water superstructures  
**[0:27:03-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:03):**  triggered by either different minerals around or sound resonating with this water or  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  a zodiac constellation that does whatever with the bacteria in the soil and whatever metabolites,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  they all begin to produce. We just don't know. This is something that we don't know. I'm just  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:24):**  talking of an idea how to connect these dots. We will have different enzyme activities and thus  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  different programs that a plant can run into its metabolism easier at these times. And so what I  
**[0:27:40-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  think is that we have a metabolic wave and this fits perfectly. This idea from the toons where  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  you have carbohydrates on leaf days, where you have protein synthesis on fruit days, where you  
**[0:27:56-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  have secondary metabolites on flower days, and we have salt uptake on earth days. I don't think  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  that we are looking at different phenomenon. I think we are really looking at the same phenomenon  
**[0:28:10-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  from a different perspective with a different wording. Fascinating. So when we consider water  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:18):**  superstructures and how they're influenced by all of these different, perhaps cosmic influences,  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:25):**  you know, I'm really intrigued in the last few minutes you've referenced the course that you have  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  put together. I want to talk a little bit about this. So for my listeners, you know that I have  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:37):**  been very intrigued by many of the unexplained phenomena in plant growth and plant development.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  How is it possible that we are growing a, let's say a zucchini crop that is supposed to go from  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  seed to harvest in 57 days, but we have growers that are taking it from seed to harvest in 30  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  days when it's direct seeded. How does that work and how are we able to get these rapid  
**[0:29:02-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  growth processes? I've been doing a lot of reading in different fringe areas that describe some of  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  the impacts and influences on plant growth, areas like paramagnetism and Jerry Pollack's work on  
**[0:29:17-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  exclusion zone water and Olivier Husson's work on redox and trying to understand how do all these  
**[0:29:26-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  pieces fit together and how do they influence plant growth. And Harriet has put together a  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  course that is the most comprehensive course I have ever participated in or ever observed  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  that ties all of these different pieces together and describes how they influence soil health and  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:48):**  specifically how we can do a much better job of sequestering carbon and building carbon in our  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  soils in a really beautiful way. This course is now available on Kind Harvest and I would highly  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  encourage you to check it out. Harriet can you tell us a little bit about how did the course  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:06):**  come to be and what was your thought process? What were you trying to accomplish when you put that  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:12):**  together? Obviously 12 hours is a tremendous amount of information and there's so many  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:19):**  different pieces that people have not heard of before. I'd like to ask you to give us a summary  
**[0:30:23-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  of the course but I'm sure that would take an hour in and of itself. I don't think so. I began  
**[0:30:32-0:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  to work on this carbon issue because once I made a big big mind map to sort through all these  
**[0:30:42-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:42):**  factors that we have been talking about and I thought where could one start? What is the most  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  important factor in this game influencing most of the other factors? However I turned it I always  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  came back to soil organic matter. This is the factor that has its finger in any soil processes  
**[0:31:05-0:31:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  it influences all. This was why I set out to put together how we could control better I don't want  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:14):**  to say carbon sequestration because it's not only putting it back into the soil but also breaking it  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:19):**  down on demand. It's carbon cycling rather than sequestration. I was a bit embarrassed. I put in  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  a quotation of Albrecht who said it's no point to hoard carbon in the soil like a miser.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  I thought oh man you know this has been a while since he said that and we're still  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:39):**  working around at that point. It's a bit embarrassing. It's not only a question of putting  
**[0:31:45-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  fringe findings together but to revisit the whole soil mechanic in a way that we can get a grip on  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  the factors to get the desired results at the time we need it and in the time scale we need it.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:04):**  It's no point to say oh yes if I do that for 300 more years I will have a bit of more  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  carbon in my soils and I don't think it's necessary to wait that long. These processes can  
**[0:32:16-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  kick in pretty fast. The big deal I tried to accomplish was to put a framework or to  
**[0:32:27-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  underlie a framework that is really comprehensible to science because the details of really brand  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  new publications are really hard to grasp if you do not have an idea about soil functioning.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  I had to go through all these issues of soil aggregation, of microbial growth in the soil,  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  and how to guide these factors. I tried to integrate new points of view that we have now.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  For example the EZ water. How is this going to influence aggregation? How is the different  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  groups of microbes if I want to have humus that breaks down fast or if I want to have one that  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  keeps longer? It's no point accumulating carbon that will break down in winter if I have a cool  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:19):**  climate. I have taken a great deal of time to try to find literature about that or for example  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:26):**  which species of plants produce lasting humus and at what time should I for example sacrifice  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  agreement with? All these very practical things also. It's not only forces and I don't know  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  heirlooms, but it's really very solid data how you can control these processes in your soils.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:48):**  Basically there are two main things that could be a revolution in your agriculture. The one is  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:58):**  that a fair proportion of additional humus comes from dead microbes, that's called necromass.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  It's wise to work your soils in a way that you get this necromass and that you preserve  
**[0:34:15-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  or stabilize this necromass in your soils. Because this is something that you can get for free  
**[0:34:22-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:22):**  and it makes a major impact on soils. The other thing is that I would like to talk about a bit  
**[0:34:31-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  is that many, many, many of the scientific studies we have are with a framework of  
**[0:34:42-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  Arabidopsis, which is a brassica, and with soluble fertilizers in laboratory conditions.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  And of course we are going to see effects there that maybe are not relevant for  
**[0:35:01-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  a plant that runs on rhizophagy outside in the field. For example this plant it will be  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  considerably influenced by the Birch effect, which is dying microbes from drought and then  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  the subsequent absorption of their remnants into the plant, which results in a little fertilization.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  And this for example is something we can use if we plan our irrigation schemes. Do we want just  
**[0:35:31-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  water or do we let the soil dry out a bit more? Can we afford that? So these are basically two  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  worlds and I have called them the wick theory. The plant is a wick that is stuck in the soil  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  and it sucks in the nutrients only with diffusion flow through the bulk water in the soil.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:51):**  And the delivery theory, where we have organisms that transport nutrients towards the plant or else,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  and this is a wild theory I have, that the plant root itself can influence or can attract  
**[0:36:10-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  certain forms of metal minerals to the roots. I have spent a bit of time elaborating on that  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:19):**  in the course. Maybe this is an attractive model for you to explain, or an attractive concept to  
**[0:36:26-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  explain some findings, but what we will see certainly is if the plant receives carbon dioxide  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  either as a gas from the soil or taken up through the root, through the xylem, coming up into the  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  leaf and refixed inside the plant, of course it will not have to open the stomata and evaporate  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  all its water. The quest for carbon dioxide. So what's going to happen is that very likely it  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  will push out this water down as exudate, you know, so you have this internal cycling of water  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  up the plant and then down as exudate. So you have this incredibly improved water use efficiency  
**[0:37:08-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  if you get away from this sucking in nitrate with the transpiration flow. So if you have climates  
**[0:37:18-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  that are a bit demanding, I think that shifting into this gear that can run the plant in,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  especially with soil fungi, it will make a big change. I understand some of the implications  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:34):**  of what you were talking about when you say not consuming nitrate, but there are about a dozen  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  dominoes in that chain of a chain reaction of how this changes plant mechanisms and what is happening  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  with rhizophagy and root charges and so forth. So can you just elaborate on that a little bit?  
**[0:37:51-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  What happens when the plant no longer is absorbing nitrate that allows it to be so much more water  
**[0:37:59-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  use efficient? Okay. So number one is I have in the course, I have kind of different gears. You  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  know, I have the plant in inorganic setting only. You have the plant with bacterial bodies and you  
**[0:38:11-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:11):**  have the setting with fungi and bacteria. And this is, you know, a plant has to have redundant  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  mechanism. It cannot fall dead as soon as a cow pee is beside it. So it will have to cope with  
**[0:38:26-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  urea or nitrate or whatsoever, but also without it. And the thing is that we have now in general,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  an agriculture that disfavors fungi. And what we do is we rub the soil with long distance trading  
**[0:38:47-0:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  possibilities. So in terms of nitrate, this does mean that the reduction of nitrate is shifted  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:55):**  towards the fungal partner. So the plant does not have to reduce the nitrate itself.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:03):**  That's one big part. So the nitrate does not accumulate. If the plant has to transpire,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  or if it has the stoma open for the quest for carbon dioxide, it will, if there's nitrate  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  and soil solution, it will have to take it up. It cannot avoid it. So you will end up  
**[0:39:20-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:20):**  with the nitrate in the leaf and the vacuoles with bitterness for the consumers. No grazers,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  they do not like it. Every child knows that if you just pick the grass beside the dog's poo,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  the rodents will refuse it. The cows do not like to eat nitrate loading grasses. And then you have  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:42):**  the problem that the plant needs to counterbalance this osmotic load inside the leaf, inside the  
**[0:39:48-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  vacuole. If it has, it can use potassium. If it hasn't, it will use other stuff like amino acids,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  proline also, or polyamines, which stink, attract flocks, for example, that's that problem.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:04):**  And it's energy consuming to synthesize that. So if you do not have this active osmotic load  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  in the vacuole, the plant can save on that. And it will not, if you have a leaf of a salad plant  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:20):**  in the hand and you crush it, you know, salad growers do that very often to test the quality.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  The plant's leaf will either crush if there is a lot of nitrate and the tissue has no good quality,  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  or it will just spring back. If you cut a plant, a lettuce, for example, that has microbial bodies  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:38):**  that feed it, you cut it, you put the dressing on and you leave it. And one day later, it just  
**[0:40:43-0:40:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  looks the same. It doesn't collapse. You know, the other thing is that if you look in a bacterial  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:53):**  setting, for example, or in a dry setting, and you have a rice sheath that is this layer around  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  the root that you cannot shake off when you pull up the plant gently off the soil, and you have  
**[0:41:04-0:41:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:04):**  a high salt setting, the plant has really trouble to maintain that. If it is a low salt setting,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:12):**  it's easy to put out some gel and to keep the water close to the root and to extract the nutrients  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  from the material adjacent to the root. There's so many dots to connect when we think about  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  water use efficiency and carbon cycling. I know that in the course, you also describe the influence  
**[0:41:35-0:41:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:35):**  that biophotonics has or can have, and you also describe dark endophytes, which was something  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:42):**  that was completely new for me. Can you tell us a little bit about those?  
**[0:41:46-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  Yeah, I love them. It is a group of fungi that do not make fruiting bodies, as we scientists say.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  So what you see around like a toadstool or whatever small version of it is the sexual  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  reproduction stage of the fungus. So these dark septite endophytes, they do not do that.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  They can make spore stages, but they're asexual. So it's pretty hard to know who these guys are.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  And usually they're Eskomias seeds, and they have pretty tough cell walls. So I have seen them  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:23):**  around in rototilled soils a bit where I could not detect any mycorrhizal fungi. The thing is that  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  these dark septite endophytes, they modulate the redox status of the plant metabolism. And I found  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  that really interesting. And this was the moment where I began to dig in that story a bit. And then  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  I remembered a podcast I had heard years, years, years before where Cryptococcus is growing in  
**[0:42:52-0:43:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  Chernobyl eating gamma rays. And when I heard that, I thought, maybe, maybe not. And so I had  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:06):**  a look into this melanin business, which is coloring the cell walls of these endophytes,  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:13):**  making them dark. And melanin is indeed an antenna for the whole spectrum of electromagnetic  
**[0:43:21-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  radiation from very long wavelength until or through the visible wavelength, right until  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  gamma rays, very high energy load of the electrons. And the interesting thing is that  
**[0:43:36-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  melanin can use that energy and generate reduction power from that. And I think this is fascinating  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  because it allows you to have soils that are not so dependent on green plants. If you have,  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  for example, empty follow-up periods, and you have these dark septite endophytes around that can feed  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:59):**  on either light or metabolic warmth, or even if you happen to have radioactive elements around  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  on that, not on the element, but on the radiation, you can maintain an input of reduction power into  
**[0:44:14-0:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:14):**  the soil and recycle carbon into organic forms. It can be refixed in the soil. Totally fascinating.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  So let's make this really simple. What I think you're describing is that when you have  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  these dark septate endophytes that have melanin in them, they can intercept a broad array of  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  wavelengths and they can continue to get energy from these different wavelengths,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  rather than getting energy from plants and continue to be metabolically active and continue  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  to fix carbon, even in the absence of growing plants on the soil. Is that right? Yeah, that's  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:54):**  right. Because you have in soils, you have, I think it was four fifth of the carbon and the  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  turnover in the soil is recycled. So the plant injects it and then it gets recycled and recycled  
**[0:45:08-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  and recycled between the microbes. So it needs to be refixed, regenerated into organic forms,  
**[0:45:16-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  like sugar or whatsoever. Yeah. And then again, breathed out as carbon dioxide and refixed again.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  So these dark septate endophytes, they seem to be not recognized part of this puzzle.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  And for example, I was very often pondering about that, that biodynamic farmers here in Germany,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  they have had best yields with their fellows over winter. And this does not fit at all with  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:48):**  the view that's currently propagated that you have to have living roots all the time, every moment.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  How is that possible? I think that these fungi are a part of this explanation.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:02):**  Something else that you and I have spoken about is the observation or the capacity to  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  build stable humic substances during the winter months. How do these endophytes and how do these  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:16):**  specific fungi tie in with that, if at all? What's happening there? They do. I mean,  
**[0:46:21-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  melanized necromas, you remember that is dead microbes in the soil, cycles.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  It's eaten again by other microbes that fuel their metabolism from that or recycle it right  
**[0:46:38-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:38):**  into producing their cell walls. And melanized cell walls cycles lower. So that's one part.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  There is many things we do not know yet. Melanin seems to transfer also electric currents. And  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  this is a big issue in soils. We have charges, currents, loads everywhere. Humus is really a  
**[0:47:02-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  battery. It can charge up literally. And melanin, they have used it as an electron donor. And it's  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  and it's like a synthetic material of the best quality, just right as it is in nature.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah. It's stable, free, radical, and it is amazing stuff. And it is applied in technical  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  environments. And this is what I'm always... Throughout this whole preparation of the carbon  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  cause, very often I found data in technical settings that I had to reintroduce into the  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:41):**  soil setting. And biologists, they do not like to work a lot with forces. They love chemicals,  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  but not forces. So you find the data if you want to work about forces in engineered papers.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  You've just mentioned that there are all kinds of forces and fields and currents. And when you look  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  at these different forces on different levels, like the charge on the clicolloids and the charge  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  held within humus, and now the charges held on melanin, there are so many different levels. And  
**[0:48:12-0:48:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  I think what is not appreciated is that the forces are much greater and much bigger than we might  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:19):**  anticipate. I think the piece that we've missed is that plants don't grow from nutrients. They don't  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:25):**  grow from calcium and magnesium potassium ions. Instead, they grow from the charge that is carried  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:31):**  by those elements. I dislike using the word energy because it's so ambiguous and can mean so many  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  different things, but plants don't grow from nutrients. They grow from charge. They grow  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  from energy. And what you're describing fits into that or is, is a part of that. Of course.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  I think it's both, you know, you have always the structural aspect, you know, where you see  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  a certain element taking place as a part in a molecule, you know, for example. Right.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  And then you have the other bit, you know, where it resonates, where it is shifting electrons  
**[0:49:10-0:49:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  around in redox reaction, where it is attracted here or pushed away there. But I was really  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:19):**  surprised about the order of magnitude of all these electric or charge phenomena in soil.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  A while ago, I have had a look into water electro precipitation because I was interested if the  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  plant achieves high enough charges or electrostatic charges that water precipitates inside it again.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  Then you see the technical papers and you think, never, never going to reach the order of magnitude  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  of that that needs to be applied to precipitate water vapor. And then you look in soil and you  
**[0:49:56-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  see clay has these charges. Everything is there, you know, and we're just, I think we have really  
**[0:50:04-0:50:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  missed out thinking about the plant as an active organism influencing, for example, water  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:12):**  condensation around those. I think it probably does, but no literature about it. And also  
**[0:50:19-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:19):**  that's again, this topic with Arabidopsis in the lab with this type of nutrition, it will not  
**[0:50:27-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  accumulate that charges. We need a plant with perfect mineral nutrition that has a wax coating,  
**[0:50:35-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  and then you will see other phenomena happening. One of the topics that Carrie Reems used to talk  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  about, I also haven't seen this in the literature to support this, although we've had some  
**[0:50:47-0:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  interesting observations, but he said that when plants are really healthy and they achieve  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:54):**  high Brix levels and high state of health, they can absorb 80% of their nutrition from the air  
**[0:51:00-0:51:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:00):**  rather than from the soil. And this at first glance seems rather far-fetched, but when you  
**[0:51:09-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:09):**  recognize what it means for a plant to have a waxy coating and what that means for plant charge  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  and how plants will attract any charged particles in the air to their leaf surface,  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  it seems perhaps less implausible than it did at first. This is something where I know too little  
**[0:51:29-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  about, but what I can say, what I found data about is that pathogens spores, for example,  
**[0:51:37-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  they will fly away from a plant that has this electrostatic charge up when it's really healthy.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:48):**  They have created nettings because of course, again, we're there, we find a technical solution  
**[0:51:54-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:54):**  with nettings and they charge the nettings and then the spores fly away. But the plant,  
**[0:52:01-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  a healthy plant with this waxy coating, it can achieve the same charges that are necessary.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  The other thing is the pollination. You have once mentioned strawberries possibly self-pollinating  
**[0:52:15-0:52:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  and what I think now is pollen has been shown to be attracted electrostatically to the pollinators,  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  to the bumblebees. They fly and they have this fur and we know from Callahan that these  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:30):**  this fur charges up and the pollen just jumps over to the insect.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:37):**  Wow.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  So what I think or what I have observed in my haemal reproduction is that exceptionally healthy  
**[0:52:47-0:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:47):**  individuals tend to self-pollinate and if they are miserable and unhealthy, they cannot do that.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:57):**  So what I expect to be true is that the tip, you know, the female reproductive organ is the very  
**[0:53:06-0:53:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  tip where most of the charge accumulates and I expect and under certain conditions the pollen  
**[0:53:13-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:13):**  will jump right over. But as I said, I have seen this phenomenon only in exceptionally healthy  
**[0:53:22-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  individuals.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  Another phenomena that I'd love to get your perspective on is the phenomena of soils being  
**[0:53:28-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  warm in the winter. So we have any number of photos of farmers who have used our soil primer  
**[0:53:36-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  applications late in the fall and their fields have all the snow melted off when the rest of the  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  landscape is covered in six inches or a foot of snow. How does that happen?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:50):**  Well, I do not know exactly because you would really need to to investigate that. But what I think is  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  number one is just if you have a very active microbial life in that, of course, they have a  
**[0:54:04-0:54:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  metabolic warmth. They just radiate warmth just as we do. And the second is if you have different  
**[0:54:12-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:12):**  groups in there, especially in the winter, archaea are favorite, they are the most common  
**[0:54:18-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  archaea favorite over eubacteria. So these guys, they seem to have their time of their life in  
**[0:54:27-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  winter. No concurrence. And then these bacteria are not bacteria, these archaea, they're not bacteria,  
**[0:54:36-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  they will lose a higher portion of warmth to the environment when they live, when they have their  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  ordinary processes. They're not as effective. So they generate more heat. They generate more heat.  
**[0:54:51-0:55:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:51):**  And one thing that I have also seen myself is if you have more carbon in the soil, stable carbon,  
**[0:55:02-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  the structure changes and the carbon charges up in there, you have more vapor and the soil breathes.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  So heat conduction in the soil happens through water vapor. I have done a whole segment in the  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  course because this is so under appreciated that the soil really breathes. Air pressure  
**[0:55:29-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:29):**  helps the soil breathe out in the morning and presses air back into the soil and also wind  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  exchanges the air in the soil. There is really dramatic air flows to great depth in the soil  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:44):**  if the soil has a structure. And so I can imagine that the whole package, you have more carbon in  
**[0:55:50-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:50):**  the soil, less compaction, just less bulk water or water saturation, more air exchange in the soil,  
**[0:56:01-0:56:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  more heat generated. And I can imagine that this is enough to melt the snow on top.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:08):**  Yeah. Harriet, you have included so much information in the course. We could continue  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:13):**  this conversation for some time to talk about all of the different facets and all the different  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:19):**  pieces. Are there any other highlights, pieces of the course that you would like to touch on briefly?  
**[0:56:23-0:56:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:23):**  Yes, one. And this is a very general guideline. You need two things in balance to make your soil  
**[0:56:34-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:34):**  work out. And this is the presence of stable carbon so that it can charge up with mineral  
**[0:56:41-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  nutrition. If you have either of one, it will not work. You need soil organic matter with  
**[0:56:54-0:57:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  minerals. And this enables the plant to feed on demand. Whatever it needs, at what time it needs  
**[0:57:02-0:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:02):**  it, and then the thing flies. But usually you have either the promotion of carbon in the soil,  
**[0:57:14-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:14):**  and this will not help you if it's an empty pantry or the mineral nutrition, which is fantastic.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  But it's a lot of work. You have to do the monitoring, you have to run and fold your feed  
**[0:57:27-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:27):**  or put it in the soil all the time. So if you have these two things together and the minerals can  
**[0:57:33-0:57:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  bind to the soil and they are delivered or bio-weathered by the microbiology, stored in  
**[0:57:40-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:40):**  the human substances and then discharged to the plant on demand, and the plant can do that, then  
**[0:57:48-0:57:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  you get performance and health. And you can sleep in the hammock meanwhile, and soil doesn't work.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  Thank you very much Harriet. I want for all of our listeners who've listened to this point,  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  I just want to say simply that there is no way we can do justice in a podcast interview  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  to the scope of research and work that Harriet has done. And I think that's a really important  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  thing that Harriet has put into her course. It's 12 hours long. For those of you who've listened  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:23):**  to Olivier Husson's six-hour course that is available for free on the Academy on redox,  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  the common, we've received well over a thousand testimonials from people who've taken that course,  
**[0:58:36-0:58:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  who have said that it was completely, completely changed their perspective on how they grow plants.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:42):**  And the way that Harriet has put together supersedes even that in two very interesting,  
**[0:58:49-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  oh yes Harriet, yes it does, in that it is very broad and compassing information from many  
**[0:58:55-0:59:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  different fields. And Harriet connects all those dots and explaining them in a very simple,  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Harriet_Mella_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:02):**  understandable way. Harriet, I'm very honored that you have been able and willing to share this

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:49:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kampf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:01:33):**  resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:03):**  agriculture podcast. Today in this episode, I am super excited to have Greg Pennyroyal here on the  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:10):**  show with us. I'm not even quite sure how to introduce Greg. He has done some fascinating work,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:17):**  currently working in video culture, vineyard production in California, but he also has a very  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:23):**  interesting background doing quite a bit of work and a fascinating life story. Perhaps, Greg, I'm  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:28):**  just going to turn it over to you. Can you tell us a little bit about the pathway and the journey  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:32):**  that has brought you to where you are today and some of the things that you've worked on along  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:35):**  the way? Absolutely. Hi John, always a pleasure to talk to you. Yeah, I've had kind of a journey from  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:42):**  starting with a small family farm in upstate New York to where I am now, which is the vineyard  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:49):**  manager at Wilson Creek and professor of viticulture at the local college, but let's  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:54):**  start at the beginning. Actually, the real start was I grew up in New Jersey in Asbury Park with  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:02:59):**  a rock and roll band and living the whole Asbury Park rock and roll lifestyle, which I recommend.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:06):**  If you can survive it, I highly recommend it. It was a ton of fun, but then we went from literally  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:12):**  the bosom of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and high culture in New Jersey to Appalachia in New York,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:18):**  where we bought a family farm and we didn't know what we were doing. My mom was actually  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:24):**  a classically trained herbalist from Norway and she had always wanted to move back to the farm.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:30):**  So when we got a chance, we moved out of New Jersey. I was still in high school. We moved  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:34):**  up to the farm. We took the band van and moved everyone. It said in big letters on the side,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:39):**  Lady's Choice, which was the name of the disco band at the time. And we showed up at this farm  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:44):**  not knowing what to do. So I promptly went to the auction house, bought what I thought was a plow,  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:50):**  but it was actually a horse-drawn cultivator. We couldn't afford a tractor or a horse, so we hooked  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:03:54):**  it onto the bumper of the Lady's Choice band van and started trying to plow an abandoned field with  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:01):**  a cultivator, which I could do. You could imagine it just didn't work. One of my neighbors, an old  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:08):**  silly gentleman, would pull up every day, pop open the tailgate of his, I believe it was a 46 Ford,  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:15):**  in immaculate condition, crack open a beer, smoke a cigar, shake his head, get in his truck. And  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:20):**  then finally after four or five days of this, he calls me and he goes, hey boy, get up here.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:25):**  And I walked up and he said, you don't have a damn clue what you're doing, do you?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:30):**  And I said, no, sir. I have so little of a clue that I don't even know how clueless I am. I have  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:35):**  such a little clue. And he laughed and he introduced himself. He was the local dairy farmer.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:40):**  He had 250 acres, 90 heads. He had just retired about a year before and was bored. And the stars  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:47):**  aligned for me on that day. His name was Hiram Wilbur. Still to this day, I count him as one of  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:51):**  my best friends. He passed away years ago, but he was my first mentor and he was a great mentor.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:04:56):**  He had that classic knowledge of what goes on. He was also just funnier than hell and fun to work  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:03):**  with. But he said he'd come over a couple of days a week and give me a pointer for a couple of hours.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:07):**  He wound up coming down five, sometimes six days a week, working with me three, four hours.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:12):**  Loaned me his Ford Ferguson tractor, which I have to admit with a nice three bottom plow on it,  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:18):**  was a huge improvement over a band of cultivators spinning in the mud. And that first lesson I kind  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:24):**  of learned on that was the value of having a mentor. So sort of a shout out to some of the  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:29):**  young farmers or people, actually not to be young, just people who are getting into agriculture,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:34):**  try and find a mentor. And especially if you can find an old school mentor, you will be really  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:39):**  well served. I learned things from Hiram that have served me literally all my life. Still to this day,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:45):**  I'll sometimes be in a pickle and I'll think, well, what would Hiram do here? And it's just  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:49):**  that kind of down home logic that he had. But he also had a, his ability to observe was phenomenal.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:05:55):**  And that's one of those things, if I'm confused about something, I'll sometimes just stop and look  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:00):**  and observe like Hiram would do. So that was my first major lesson in agriculture. I learned a  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:04):**  lot of very specific things like how to run a tractor and how to cultivate and how to do things  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:08):**  like that. But it was mostly an approach I took. And having that perspective when I went to college  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:15):**  and I started taking agronomy classes and all that, it heightened my bullshit detectors.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:19):**  And I would read kind of the standard university dogma of what they thought should happen. And  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:25):**  I just had that heightened sense of this doesn't really make sense. And this is one of those  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:29):**  things that's really common in the, whatever you call the sort of community that we all live in,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:35):**  John, this alternative ag or biological ag or eco ag. People have that sense. They can just look at  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:41):**  something and go, you know, it just doesn't quite make sense. And I think the difference is we've  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:46):**  learned how to observe. We've learned how to go out there and observe. So we were pretty successful  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:50):**  on the farm, ran that farm for about a decade. Then I got an opportunity to a friend of mine,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:06:56):**  Lon Johnson owned Trout Lake Farms. At the time, Lon was, he's an organic farmer. At the time,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:02):**  it was about 380 acres of certified organic herbs, Echinacea, Valerian, St. John's Wort, you know,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:07):**  a lot of mostly medicinal herbs. Went to visit Lon, realized that we had a chemistry together  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:14):**  and that Lon was just brilliant in agriculture. And I could bridge that world between agriculture  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:20):**  and business, because I was also running a construction company, putting myself through  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:23):**  school at the time. And I wound up working with Lon for over a decade. And Lon and a bunch of us  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:29):**  together built that company from just under 400 acres to 3,000 acres of all organic medicinal  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:36):**  herbs. And it was a real admit, this was the Pacific Northwest, the soil was volcanic soil,  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:41):**  was unusually rich. We had a program of only going into valleys that are, you know, growing areas  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:48):**  that had a dairy, because our main nutrient source was composted lagoon, dairy manure, and dairy  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:07:54):**  waste that we composted. And what I learned there is that how you can scale up and the profitability  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:00):**  of organic agriculture. I hear this from some organic growers. For example, one of the odder  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:06):**  claims to fame is we had is we literally cornered the market, the world market in catnip. And if you  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:11):**  go out to the store and you buy catnip for your cat, you'll notice it almost always says organic.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:16):**  Well, the reason being is it's actually cheaper to grow organic, a lot cheaper to grow organic.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:20):**  And the oil content is quite a bit higher, and you get a slight premium for it. So sort of a win,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:24):**  win, win all the way across the board. And what I learned with working with Lon is how you can  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:29):**  integrate business ideas and figure out where your strengths are, where the biological agriculture  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:35):**  gives you benefit and use that to your advantage. But don't become greedy with it. We could have  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:42):**  probably charged more for our catnip and we didn't. We charged a slight premium, which helps support  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:46):**  other things, but it also solidified our place in the market. People came back to us and even when  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:52):**  other people tried to compete, they would say, you know, you've always been fair to us. You've always  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:08:56):**  sold us a great product at a reasonable price and sort of that business side of how to scale up.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:01):**  Then after that, I got an incredible opportunity to work with a company called liner health product,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:06):**  which made a lot of OTC drugs for the consumer market and primarily a drug company, but they had  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:12):**  a dietary supplement division that was taking off. And the head of their science center, Dr. Bob Kay,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:18):**  recruited me because he wanted to get more into botanicals. And the great part about liner is  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:23):**  we're in trout lake. I had a few thousand dollars per year for research, but with liner,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:28):**  I had hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to do research. So I promptly called up every crazy  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:34):**  wacko, PhD, you know, natural products, biochemist, and everything. And we pulled together this  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:41):**  science team. And if you're involved in the dietary supplement industry, you'll notice there  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:46):**  was sort of a boom of scientifically supported dietary supplements starting in about 1998.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:52):**  And a lot of that came out of liner health. And the value I learned about that is the value of  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:09:57):**  science is just because we are looking for alternatives, standard agriculture, that doesn't  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:04):**  mean we need to be looking for alternatives for science. You know, the great limitations of science  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:09):**  where you pull away a lot of the variables and you look at single things, you get incredibly deep  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:14):**  insights, but you tend not to see how things are connected together. And the value of that  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:19):**  experience was learning how powerful science can be if you have a perspective that sort of connects  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:26):**  the dots, if you know how that fits in. We are also able with that to develop something called  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:33):**  genomic assay testing for natural products. And the challenge in the past was they said that  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:39):**  natural products could never have standards like medicines because you couldn't standardize the  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:45):**  raw material. They said the basic raw material was too complex. You know, they tried to go after  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:50):**  the single active compound, and that's just bogus because that's not how plants work. And that's  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:55):**  not actually not how our bodies work either. And it's surely not how the two work together.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:10:59):**  Then they tried to do polypharmy and it was a pharmaceutical and there's a bunch of ways of  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:04):**  approaching it. But the breakthrough that we made, and it was connected to my experience in  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:08):**  agriculture, is we would get samples of say Echinacea purpura. We were getting samples from  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:13):**  across the country and even across the world. And we were seeing a huge variation in hemotypical  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:19):**  expression of the plants, you know, the chemical components. And the one thing that we noticed is  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:25):**  those that tended to be grown in an ecosystem that was closer to where the plant was native to  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:30):**  and used biological principles had much, much less variation from season to season, from  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:37):**  farm to farm. And we drilled down to figure out that the plants that are built, that are  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:43):**  grown in a biological system, tend to have much more biochemical homeostasis. That homeostatic  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:50):**  variable layer becomes incredibly narrow. And so the variable that people were dealing with wasn't  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:11:56):**  actually natural plant hemotypical expression variation. It was expression from plants being  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:02):**  grown in inappropriate ecosystems with inappropriate inputs and techniques. And once we stuck to pretty  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:08):**  much biologically formed and organic materials, that variability narrowed way down. And so now we  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:16):**  had that variability issue dealt with, and we needed a way of having an understanding of how  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:22):**  that works in the body. And so we developed a system where you can take herbal extracts,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:28):**  you put them in a clone selection of white blood cells, and we're not talking like GMO clones,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:33):**  it's just me to take a single cell, you keep growing it out till you get consistency in the  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:37):**  cell. And the way cells naturally communicate with the body by doing something called up and  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:42):**  down regulation. All genes send out this constant little chemical bleep, bleep, bleep, I'm here,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:48):**  I'm here, I'm here. And then when a material is introduced to it, either bleep bleep bleeps  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:53):**  faster and sends out faster signal or slows down. It's called up and down regulation. And when you  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:12:57):**  look at that across the 40 something plus thousand genes, you can compare that to databases. And that  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:04):**  says, oh, this is anti-inflammatory, this is, you know, whatever the physiological relationship is.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:11):**  What was so exciting about that is that made a connection between biological integrity and the  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:19):**  human genome, which means us. And this is one of these things that those of us in the alternative  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:25):**  agricultural community sort of know intuitively, but it's nice to have hard science behind it. And  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:31):**  it's nice to be able to get quantitative data out of that. One of the other interesting things that  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:36):**  came up with that is we not only tested herbal extracts, but we tested a homeopathic preparation  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:42):**  of Arnica, Montana. Those folks who aren't familiar with homeopathy, which I don't think is  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:48):**  a whole lot, but the basic theory is you start out with a 1X, which is a 10%. It's an herbal extract,  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:13:53):**  basically. And then you dilute it by 90%, you know, one 10th, the 2X. You dilute it again,  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:00):**  it's a 1%, the 3X, et cetera. And you saw the drop off of the gene expression that you would  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:04):**  extract. But then when you got near 24X, which is Avogadro's number, it means theoretically,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:08):**  there's no molecules of the original substance left in that water. It started to go back up.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:14):**  And when we got to 30X, it was actually stronger than the original herbal extract.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:21):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah, that blew our minds. You know, those of us, I've always taken Arnica. It works. You know,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:27):**  I also take rust poxodendron. If you're out in the woods collecting stuff and you're susceptible  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:32):**  to poison ivy, a couple of rust poxodendron in your water bottle will sort of keep you from  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:36):**  getting it. But that was sort of a glimpse into this whole thing of quantum chemistry and that  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:42):**  there are whole other worlds that we have just kind of barely scratched. You know,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:49):**  I think of guys like Phil Callahan, who just, you know, made the connection between radio frequency  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:14:54):**  and plant communication. And that led me to doing some work with the Global Institute of  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:00):**  Tibetan Medicine. And what we're looking for them is this work that we did with the USP eventually  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:06):**  led to a dietary supplement compendium and a traditional medicine compendium, which is pretty  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:11):**  cool because now there is a legal compendium for dietary supplements and traditional medicines.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:17):**  And people can't make the claim anymore that these are unregulated non-drugs. They have the  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:22):**  same standard as non-prescription drugs because of this. But the Global Institute of Tibetan  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:28):**  Medicine approached me to do something similar for Tibetan medicine. And I'm actually still  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:32):**  working with them on that. But the real value of that one, with my interaction with the Global  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:38):**  Institute of Tibetan Medicine, was this huge paradigm shift. The Tibetans have such a different  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:43):**  view of the world, it's shocking. And the insight that they get from it is even more shocking. So,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:49):**  for example, we were working on a multiple sclerosis medicine based on a Tibetan herb  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:15:56):**  that's extremely rare and hard to find. And Dr. Lovesong, the head physician,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:01):**  identified the California white sage as being energetically similar. And when we actually ran  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:08):**  the genetics on it and did it, lo and behold, it really was. But the part that was the most  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:13):**  fascinating about that is we're working with a researcher, Dr. Cynthia Husted, at the time she  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:19):**  was at UC Santa Barbara. And she had come up with a new theory for multiple sclerosis, which is that  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:25):**  what happens is the myelin sheath, it's like an insulating layer of lipids around the nerve,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:30):**  starts to demyelinate. And she had invented this technology called an atomic force microscope,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:36):**  or I should say, invented the application to how to do this, and came up with a new theory,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:41):**  which by the way, is now the theory of demyelination and multiple sclerosis.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:45):**  And this Tibetan doctor, Dr. Lovesong, pulls out these hooks from these scrolls that were almost  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:50):**  400 years old and had the exact same thing on it. And Dr. Husted and I are looking at her and  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:16:56):**  at him saying, how did you figure this out without the technology? And they said, well, we have a  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:01):**  theory and we post a hypothesis, and then we meditate and do mental models and meditate our  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:08):**  way through this and come out with a new theory. And then they literally run facsimile experiments  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:15):**  in their mind, which is pretty cool in itself. It works. And so that just blew my paradigms out of  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:22):**  the water to realize there's so much more out there than we know. And to be open to it, you  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:28):**  know, you have to, you know, you have to have your bullshit detectors on both sides. You know, there's  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:32):**  the woo-woo kind of new age thing, and then there's the kind of equally woo-woo, you know,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:36):**  commercial scientific Monsanto side. And they're both trying to tell you stories. And I'm not sure  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:41):**  how to advise people to figure out what's true, except to learn how to listen to your heart and  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:47):**  to just get a sense. You know, you see the dots kind of connecting and things generally tend to  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:52):**  fit into that, or they generally tend to not. And that eventually led me here to Wilson Creek Winery.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:17:57):**  And that would seem like an odd turn, but not really. I mean, one, I have to admit making wine  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:03):**  is so much fun and hanging out with people at a really great time is just so much fun.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:08):**  But after the kind of intense life I led with the USP and the NIH grants and all that stuff,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:14):**  it's a welcome relief. But the really interesting part about viticulture is it's one of the very  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:19):**  few agricultural crops where you actually get paid for quality. If I can produce great grapes  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:24):**  and I can produce an amazing bottle of Malbec, I can get 60 to 80, actually $100 a bottle of it's  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:30):**  really good, which equates to $6,000 a ton. That's $6 a pound for grapes. That's six times  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:37):**  the commercial market for it. And not that money drives everything, but when you're doing research,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:42):**  it helps. And so the unique position I find myself in here is I have the ability to gamble,  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:49):**  do experiments, figure out what works. And if it doesn't work, we're not going to go broke.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:18:54):**  We're doing okay. The wine business is a good business. And we have a wine club with 7,000  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:01):**  people in it. We get on weekends up to 2,000 people coming to visit the winery. People like  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:07):**  to come to classes. They like to hear lectures. People don't come to wineries for the wine. They  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:12):**  come to wineries for the experience. And the unique position I find myself here is instead  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:17):**  of giving them a rote experience about just talking about Bordeaux and blah, blah, blah,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:22):**  and some of that, which is interesting and fun. When I start talking about the kind of things  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:26):**  that you and I are exploring and experimenting with, John, that whole thing about the connection  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:31):**  to the microbiome and the connection to who we are and that drinking a glass of wine that comes  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:37):**  from a highly balanced, highly connected microbiome very likely is going to positively  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:42):**  affect your microbiome. People intuitively know that this is true and they light up,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:47):**  but they don't hear this very often. I think we often get discouraged because we have to  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:52):**  do our work over the loudspeaker of Monsanto and Bayer Pharmaceuticals and all these guys who have  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:19:59):**  quite a paid megaphone. But the truth of the matter is when you sit down with people and you  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:04):**  feed them real food and you feed them a really good glass of wine that comes from a biological  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:08):**  vineyard, the intelligence of that just transfers directly and they get it. You and I were talking  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:14):**  last week about a research article that I just sent called the Microbiodeography of Wine Grapes  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:20):**  as a Condition of Cultivar Vintage and Climate. And basically what it's saying is there's a  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:24):**  concept in winemaking called terroir. And terroir is that unique characteristic that grapes get and  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:30):**  that is transferred into the wine based on a unique region. So for example, to cite the  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:37):**  examples in the study, there's the Sonoma, Napa, and then Central Coast. And they're all considered  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:43):**  regions of unique terroir. So what they did with this is because we can now do polymer chain  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:49):**  reaction, polymerized chain reaction to get the DNA from large sections, you can literally collect  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:20:56):**  the air, the soil, everything from a region and look at all the DNA that's expressing in that  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:02):**  region, which is something new that we haven't been able to do. So what they did is they went  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:07):**  to three different cultivars in three different regions, they collected all the data, and then they  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:12):**  had the computer scramble it and then say, okay, these naturally fall together based on varietal.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:18):**  And they did to a pretty good extent. The Cabernet tended to have one bio-genomic expression, the  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:27):**  other two were. But here's the mind blower. They then said, okay, is there a connection  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:32):**  between those regions that are uniquely identified as having a unique terroir? In other words,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:38):**  same genus species varietal, but grown in different regions. And each one of these regions  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:44):**  is known to have a unique taste influence, tactile, olfactory, all those aspects. And  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:52):**  the answer was not only yes, it was even stronger than the species association.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:57):**  Wow, that's incredible.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah, we've been struggling with this whole thing about what makes terroir. And the geologists all  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:05):**  think it's geology, right? The biologists all think it's biology. The geneticists all think  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:09):**  it's genetics. The old Maslowian thing, if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:14):**  Well, they're all pounding their nails until these guys came along and said, no, it's probably the  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:17):**  microbiome. I was thinking of the guys who were trying to identify the elephant.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:21):**  Yeah, yeah. So it's the microbiome. And they make that, what I really love about this article too,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:27):**  is, as you know, you probably read a lot of scientific articles also. When they actually  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:31):**  come to the conclusion to the significance, there's sometimes a little chicken about  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:36):**  actually, you know, making assumptions and saying, this is the potential of this. These guys aren't,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:40):**  they say, this has huge implications, not only for winemaking, but for food production. It means  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:47):**  the taste and hence the quality and the nutritional density has a lot to do with what they call  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:53):**  microbial patterns, which enhance biological control in these systems. They're making that  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:22:58):**  connection. And, you know, I wouldn't exactly call these guys alternative, but they looked at  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:03):**  the signs and it led them to biological ecoag. That is really fascinating. It also leads us back  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:09):**  to what you were mentioning earlier when you were describing phenotypical expression. And I'd like  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:15):**  to understand a bit more deeply, you described that when plants were grown in their native  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:20):**  environment with biological practices, the phenotypical expression, which another way  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:27):**  of saying that, if I'm understanding it correctly, is the profile of the medicinal compounds or the  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:33):**  plant compound, various compounds that plants are producing were optimized is the word that I'll use.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:38):**  Right. And that's actually, we were looking at not only phenotypical, but more chemotypical is the,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:44):**  you know, the chemical matrix. And what we found is that when you have plants that are grown in  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:50):**  using commercial agriculture, or if you're growing things like echinacea, which tend to be a prairie  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:55):**  plant, and you're growing them too far south or too far north or in soils that they don't like,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:23:59):**  they tend to like fairly rich soil. We saw a lot of difference between the different compounds.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:05):**  And at a certain point, the ratio of compounds stabilizes. And then from there, they all tend  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:11):**  to go up quantitatively. And this fits in, you know, really closely with plant sap bricks analysis,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:19):**  and the plant sap analysis that you guys are doing that says, the first thing you got to do is get  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:24):**  that plant, you know, tier one, by the way, I love that sort of Maslovian pyramid that you've made  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:30):**  of plant sort of tropic efficiencies, photosynthetic efficiencies, that graphic makes  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:35):**  more sense than a lot of stuff I've seen. And when you show it to people, people instantly get it.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:40):**  One of those, so hats off to you, that was just brilliant way of putting that. But what we've seen  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:46):**  with the medicinal, yeah, it's brilliant. What we saw in the medicinal plants is that tier one,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:52):**  the plant's struggling for survival. So of course it's all over the place. It's substituting ions  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:24:56):**  for different, you know, materials. It's doing a lot of substitution. And that's what I think they  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:00):**  were talking about with the lower brick. What's his name? We did all the bricks work up in Spokane,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:04):**  Washington. Bruce Taneo? Bruce Taneo. Yeah. That was kind of the work that Bruce, you know,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:10):**  figured out. That next level is it brings everything into balance first. And this is what  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:16):**  you're working on with the plant sap analysis is nevermind pushing the production of it, just get  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:23):**  everything to balance first. Once it's in balance, it will go up those next two tiers together in  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:29):**  balance, but you have to get to the balance. So trophic level one, struggling to survive. Number  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:34):**  two is balance. And that's what we found. Number three is enhanced production of lipids and advanced  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:41):**  proteins and things that are really difficult for the plants to produce until it's in balance.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:45):**  And then of course, the highest level is a disease, insect resistant plant that's producing,  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:25:53):**  you know, really healthy offspring. And back to the original thing about winemaking, I think also  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:00):**  transfers immune response and immune robustness to us is that we are connected to the ecosystem.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:08):**  We're literally an extension of it. Greg, when you talk about bringing plants into balance,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:13):**  are you referring to bringing them into balance from a mineral nutritional perspective or from  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:18):**  a microbiome perspective? Well, both. And I'm glad you put it that way because over the years,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:25):**  I've struggled with a lot of different, you know, I did some work with Phil Wheeler, a brilliant guy,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:31):**  you know, very practical, read Arden's books. I kind of went through the whole acres library  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:36):**  and struggled with sort of different systems, spent a couple of years studying with Elaine Ingham,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:42):**  whose soil food web stuff is just brilliant. And she's also just a lovely, lovely person. But the  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:47):**  challenge I had with them is that you would have these kinds of theories and it was either like  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:53):**  totally practical or totally theoretical. So, you know, Elaine is famous for saying,  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:26:57):**  you don't need to add anything to your soil. It's already there. You just need to step up the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:01):**  biology. And eventually the plant biological relationship will kick in. And that's probably  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:06):**  true. But the question is, how do you get there? If you just jump off the cliff and go after that,  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:12):**  you may or may not succeed. And I can't afford not to succeed. We have 240 employees here  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:18):**  and they all rely on me getting the grapes in so we can make wine. If I screw up, a lot of people  
**[0:27:23-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:23):**  lose their job. What I appreciate about your approach is it's very flexible in how you can  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:31):**  enter it. So we currently, I have 20 of my 100 acres in an experimental program using the  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:39):**  Advancing Echo Agriculture program. And we have a couple of control blocks, one that I'm doing my  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:44):**  normal process with and one that I'm kind of not really doing much. I'm just letting it do its  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:47):**  thing. And the advantage of this program is it's very methodical. So we took a look at the soil  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:54):**  profile. I took a look at some initial petiole tests I saw. And then we sent some samples out  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:27:59):**  and we developed a program and we're taking sap samples or actually leaf samples, two sap samples  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:05):**  every two weeks. And we're adjusting and we're trying to get the photosynthetic level up to that  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:09):**  point. I think the way this is going to work is step one, get the plant into mineral balance.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:16):**  Once it's in mineral balance, it'll jump up to that next tropic level. It'll start producing  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:21):**  more sugars and secondary metabolites that it's going to feed back into the soil and then start  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:26):**  feeding the soil biome, which is then going to feed more nutrients to the plant. And you start  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:31):**  to go on that positive cycle instead of the negative cycle that we've been on, which is  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:36):**  spraying glyphosate, disking. And when I first came here, they used to spray glyphosate two to  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:42):**  three times a year and disc three times a year. And that was their weed control program. We had  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:47):**  a block of old vine Chardonnay here, about 35 years old, and it was expressing red block symptoms  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:53):**  severely. And the first thing they asked me to do was to rip it out. And I said, give me a year.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:28:58):**  And we just did compost, compost teas, and mainly stopped using glyphosate. Put in a cover crop.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:04):**  In one year, you can't see the symptoms of red blotch. Red blotch doesn't go away. I think it's  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:08):**  in there. It's just not expressed. It's amazing to me how resilient many of these plants and crops  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:15):**  are. And the situation you just described is something that we've observed similar situations  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:19):**  on many different farms where trees are incredibly stressed and growers are ready to eliminate blocks  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:26):**  and sections. And they respond incredibly rapidly when given the right opportunity. It's just  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:32):**  amazing to me how quickly things can recover. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean, one year. And,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:36):**  you know, these are perennial crops. And the program that I'm doing with you right now,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:41):**  I am actually planning on this. I'm not really going to claim any absolute conclusions until  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:47):**  the second year, only because I think we're going to get much, much better results in the second  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:51):**  year. Because the way that grape physiology is, is that right after it's done setting its fruit,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:29:57):**  the apical cells for next year's fruits form on the secondary buds. And so the genetic potential  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:03):**  for next year is actually being set right now. And so I suspect that that following year where  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:09):**  the genetics of the plant have been under the supervision of this plant sap analysis.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:16):**  By the way, another comment about the plant sap analysis, I really am super pleased with the  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:21):**  results that we're getting out of this. I've been doing petiole analysis for years, and it just  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:27):**  didn't quite seem to fit. One of the things that petiole analysis keeps telling me is I'm severely  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:32):**  lacking nitrogen, but I have no symptoms whatsoever of nitrogen deficiency. And when we make wine,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:38):**  I have a pretty decent balance of nitrates, ammonia, and some complex amino acids that the  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:43):**  yeast responds to. You can't fool the yeast, it knows what it wants to eat. So it just didn't  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:48):**  look like I had a nitrogen deficiency. When we started doing the NOVA prop analysis that you  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:30:54):**  guys do, it said, no, your nitrogen is really, really good. You mostly have trace mineral  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:00):**  issues, you know, millennium, a little bit copper, there's some issues that we have with that. That  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:04):**  made a ton of sense to me. So it's nice to see analytical work line up with what I'm seeing in  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:10):**  the field. The other thing is, quite frankly, I am losing faith in petiole analysis, and I'm having  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:17):**  a hard time recommending it to other growers. I think what you just described is that's the  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:23):**  pattern that emerges with almost all agronomists. You have between six and ten years of experience,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:29):**  they look at things, and those that pay attention, all of a sudden you begin to realize that,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:34):**  you know what, the laboratory results and the field results are not corresponding. And as  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:39):**  William Albrecht said many years ago, he said, read books from steady nature, and when the two  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:44):**  of them don't agree, you throw out the books. Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:50):**  Yeah, and I think that's equally true for laboratory analysis, which is actually what led us  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:31:54):**  to bringing the South analysis here to North America and to begin working with it. I'd like to,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:00):**  there's an important topic that we were talking about though, and I'm not sure we've fully  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:03):**  unwrapped it yet, and that is the understanding of plants expressing different chemical profiles,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:10):**  different secondary metabolite profiles based on the nutritional environment and the microbial  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:15):**  environment. I think this is something that's very important for growers to understand because you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:19):**  are correct in that wine production and grape production is one of the few crops that actually  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:25):**  is compensated for that directly. But there are also, there are many other crops, particularly  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:30):**  fruit crops, where there is an indirect compensation. And the reality is there are so  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:36):**  many people today who, and they have a desire to develop a quality standard for nutrition and  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:43):**  to demonstrate nutritional integrity and nutritional density of fruit. But you know,  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:48):**  there's something that consumers really care about. Every consumer cares about this for  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:52):**  every fruit. They care about flavor and aroma. Everyone cares about flavor and aroma. And one  
**[0:32:58-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:32:58):**  of the things that I've observed in the medicinal herb production world that I think transfers to  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:06):**  fruit and vegetable production is how or what types of environments these compounds can be  
**[0:33:13-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:13):**  optimized. So there's one school of thought, which indicates that if you want to produce high levels  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:21):**  of these aromatic compounds, then you need to stress the plants. You need to deprive them of  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:26):**  moisture or nitrogen, phosphorus, or some combination of all three in order to produce  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:31):**  a lot of flavor. And on the other hand, the other opposite end of the spectrum is growing plants in  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:38):**  an optimal environment, a perfectly balanced nutrition, optimal microbiome to produce the  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:43):**  highest concentrations and quantities and quality of metabolites possible. I guarantee you that if  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:49):**  you told any cannabis grower anywhere that they should stress their plants, they would  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:33:53):**  beat you out the door. So I'd love to hear your perspective on that. How does that fit in with  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:00):**  what you've been describing? This is a debate that's sort of raging in the wine world right now.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:06):**  Specifically, it's around deficit irrigation. And the generally, there's a lot of different theories,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:11):**  but the standard theory is you give the plant virtually no stress until it's fruit set. And then  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:18):**  you start to stress it a little bit until verazion. And then from verazion on to harvest,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:22):**  you stress it quite a bit. And the theory being is that the plant isn't going to make these  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:26):**  secondary metabolites because it doesn't have to. It's too fat and happy. It's just fat and happy.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:32):**  The other thing is it's said that you get smaller berry size, which changes the ratio between skin  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:38):**  and pulp. And most of the qualities, especially a red wine, come from the pulp. I mean from the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:43):**  skin, I'm sorry. They want that higher ratio. There's some guys up in the University of  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:48):**  Washington, I'm sorry I can't pull their name off the top of my head, but I'll send you a link if  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:52):**  you're interested, that they took some blocks and they basically didn't stress them at all.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:34:58):**  And they wound up getting larger yields, better ampicinidine content, better phenolic content,  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:03):**  better amino acid balance, better acid to Brix ratio. I mean, just all the parameters across the  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:09):**  board were better, which goes against the dogma. But I think part of the reason it worked there,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:15):**  and it hasn't worked in other places, is they lucked out and they did their research on the  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:20):**  Columbia Gorge in Washington state, which is pyroclastic volcanic soils. So they're probably  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:26):**  starting with really good soils and pretty healthy plants. So they were just looking at water stress  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:31):**  and the water stress, it's kind of debunking all those original theories about why you stress  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:38):**  your vine. This is starting to come up. I intuitively think that the reason we have to  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:43):**  stress our plants is the plants don't have enough of the micronutrients of what they need to produce  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:49):**  what they want to produce. And then if you stress it to the point where you think it's going to die,  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:35:54):**  the plant goes, okay, this is it. I'm cashing in all my chips and I'm going to produce one crop of  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:00):**  seed that's going to get my progeny out there. And then of course, right after harvest, you give  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:04):**  it more nutrition and you pump it back up. You keep kind of tricking it year after year, but you  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:09):**  keep pulling from it's banks, you know, it's savings accounts. What I am anticipating is going  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:14):**  to happen out of the work that you and I are doing together now is that I will be able to produce  
**[0:36:19-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:19):**  any words from 40 to 60% higher crops at a much higher quality consistently year after year after  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:27):**  year. And if I can do that, I can change the economics of how grapes are grown in Southern  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:32):**  California, which means that biological not only becomes less expensive, but it has all the benefits  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:39):**  of, you know, water purification and, you know, all the things that we, reasons we support biological  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:44):**  ag. So I don't think there's enough research on this now. There's a little bit happening.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:49):**  You know, the challenge with standard research is you're really only supposed to test one variable  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:53):**  at a time, but I don't know how you test the variable of water stress if the plant is also  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:36:59):**  nutritionally stressed. So if I was to design an experiment, what I would do is take out the  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:05):**  nutritional stress variable, get the plants growing for a couple of years where they're,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:10):**  you know, mineral and macro and micro nutrient balance, then experiment with the water a little  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:16):**  bit. That would give you good data, but I suspect that stress is stressed. Look, the plants want to  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:21):**  produce great grapes. They want to make birds happy. So they spread the seed and I'm not even  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:27):**  totally not convinced that they might not want to make us happy. So we keep tending them in our  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:32):**  field and fussing with them. And, you know, we are doing the plant bidding for them. They give us a  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:37):**  little bit of anthocyanins and alcohol and we're happy. Yeah, I tend to agree with that perspective.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:45):**  But just on this point that we've been talking about, I've observed this phenomenon in sage  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:51):**  production and in mint production and other crops where I guess I would describe it kind of as a  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:37:55):**  reverse bell curve. So what happens initially when plants are being grown and they're being deprived  
**[0:38:02-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:02):**  of nutrients or water, then the result is that you get a relatively small amount of plant biomass  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:10):**  with a high concentration of these compounds that you're looking for, these medicinal compounds or  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:14):**  aromatic compounds. That's like being a mint in sage grower too, yeah. Yeah. And then the thought  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:20):**  is that while you don't want to provide water or phosphorus and nitrogen, if you do, and I've  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:26):**  seen, I've observed this to happen where we remove the nutrient in the water deprivation, now you get  
**[0:38:31-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:31):**  a tremendous amount of biomass. Your biomass might be four or five times more, but your quantities of  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:39):**  metabolites being produced are proportionally smaller. Right, 8% oil. Exactly. But that isn't,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:46):**  and historically the thought process has been, well, that's the end of the conversation. That's  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:50):**  where the discussion stops. But I think the point that you were making is there's one piece that  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:38:55):**  hasn't been considered yet, which is what's the nutritional integrity and the nutritional profile  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:00):**  of the plant that has a larger biomass? What if you were to grow that plant in an optimal  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:04):**  environment? And here's what I can say that we've observed so far. There's more homework that needs  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:09):**  to be done on this, but what we've observed so far is when you grow a plant in an optimal  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:14):**  environment, an optimal from a water perspective and also from a nutrient perspective, not just  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:19):**  nitrogen and phosphorus, but you're also addressing all the trace and ultra-trace minerals,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:23):**  now you're producing a plant that has a large amount of plant biomass and also has high  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:30):**  concentrations, in many cases even higher concentrations than the stress plant of these  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:35):**  secondary metabolites. And the perfect example of this is cannabis production, where  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:41):**  cannabis growers are keeping their plants in an optimal environment from a lighting perspective,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:46):**  moisture, humidity, temperature, and also nutritionally. And when they balance the  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:52):**  nutrition in correspondence with the environment, they can produce levels of  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:39:57):**  cannabinoids that are one, two, three, as much as four times higher in terms of grams per plant  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:03):**  production than any stressed plant ever could begin to produce. Right. Yeah, I mean that just  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:09):**  makes sense. I mean, I agree the first step is to balance the macro-micro nutrients. And I think in  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:14):**  the standard agronomy world, the part that's totally ignored is the micronutrients. People  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:20):**  don't even talk about them. And what I'm learning, especially this year, now that I have really good  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:24):**  data from you guys, is how important those are. Is my macros are pretty good. My micros are off.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:30):**  And it's just keeping the whole process from maximizing. There might, once you get a plant  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:36):**  to that level, there might be a few things. So for example, I prune and do my canopy management  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:41):**  in a way that I try and get a little bit of direct sunlight actually on the berries. Plus there's  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:46):**  actually a physiological reaction of the plant producing berries that has to have some sunlight  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:51):**  hitting it. It's the natural mechanism when a vine is growing in the forest and it gets to the top of  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:40:56):**  the canopy. That's what triggers its fruit. But also it triggers a little bit of the anthocyanin  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:01):**  in production. I suspect in oil crops, mid-stage, if you had a really healthy plant and you gave it  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:07):**  just a little bit of drought stress, that it would respond by producing higher levels of oils to  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:13):**  protect it from drought. But it has the reserves at that point. I think this is the part that we've missed.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:18):**  Exactly. Have the reserves to respond. It doesn't respond because you're stressing it. You know,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:24):**  athletes spend most of their time training mildly, exercising, developing their capacity, resting,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:30):**  eating well, and then they run a marathon. Well, the reason they can run a marathon is they did all  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:34):**  that stuff before that. If you just pull somebody off the street and go, here run a marathon and I  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:38):**  know you're going to do good because I stressed you, you're not going to be happy with the results.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:46):**  Yeah, neither is the athlete.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:48):**  Right, you're going to be really unhappy with the results. And you know, and so the modern  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:52):**  agriculture approach to that would be, oh, well give them a chemical that can perform. So you  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:41:57):**  have them smurf some cocaine and off he goes and then he dies and you go, well, what happened?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:03):**  Greg, you have a way with the knowledge. You hit that one pretty good. So Greg, in the  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:08):**  journey that you've been on, all the different things that you've worked on,  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:11):**  what has been something that really surprised you that was very unexpected?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:15):**  I think sort of as a general surprise is I'm sort of shocked at how much the land  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:21):**  grant university system, which was supposed to be set up to create an unbiased, scientifically  
**[0:42:26-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:26):**  driven system to support US agriculture, food supply, and all that, how much it's been co-op  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:34):**  by specific interests. The example I think about specifically is sort of the corporate line on  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:41):**  genetically modified organisms. I was at a local meeting and there was a really sweet,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:45):**  you know, young student who is, she's looking at different bridles for heat stress and just out of  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:52):**  the blue, she starts sort of doing the corporate line about how genetically genetic modification  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:42:57):**  is no different than breeding. And we've been breeding for years and years and years. And I  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:00):**  didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to embarrass her, but I see this all the time and  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:05):**  you don't have to dig very deep into the science to find out it's, you know, it's malarkey. And  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:11):**  having been in the pharmaceutical world, you know, we came up with really inexpensive cures for  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:17):**  things like acid reflux, for diabetes, but they're all based on natural products that you couldn't  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:22):**  patent. And so we were told, you know, don't touch this or you'll wind up dead in the ditch somewhere.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:28):**  So what surprised me is that of how I believe it was Thomas Jefferson originally set the system up,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:35):**  how much that's become kind of co-op. You know, Don Huber talks about this all the time. He gets  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:39):**  away with this because he's got a great reputation. He's ready to retire. If he was a young researcher,  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:45):**  he couldn't be this vocal. Elaine Ingham was booted out of the University of Oregon because  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:51):**  she spoke out against the microbiological effects of glyphosate and genetically modified organisms.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:43:57):**  And so it surprised me how integrated that's gotten in and how pervasive it is, even to the  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:03):**  point of getting people whom I respect, like Neil Degrasse Tyson, doubting how great GMOs are. And  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:09):**  it's like, Neil, come on, you're a smart guy, man. Read the research. You can't be tricked this  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:14):**  easily. So I've been really surprised by that. I think it's the co-opting has happened largely by  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:21):**  funding and funding resources. Universities today give a lot of their funding from agribusiness and  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:27):**  from industry rather than from the government. Right. Right. Yeah, I agree. We've mentioned a  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:33):**  couple of different pieces, but I'm curious what more you have that we haven't spoken about. What  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:38):**  is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other people don't  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:44):**  believe to be true? That's very different from the mainstream view. I believe that the whole idea  
**[0:44:50-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:50):**  that we are kind of, quote unquote, stewards or managers of the ecosystem isn't really true. I  
**[0:44:58-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:44:58):**  think we are the ecosystem. The ecosystem is us, microbiome, next to all of us. I think we can stop  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:05):**  looking at ourselves as somehow being separate, but being an expression of everything that's out  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:11):**  there. The responsibility of having to manage an unbelievably complex ecosystem, quite frankly,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:18):**  scares me. But being able to just go out in the vineyard with a glass of wine and get a sense of  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:23):**  what's going on and feel like the more I shut down my, not shut it down, but if I can quiet my  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:29):**  rational mind and just learn to listen and be a servant and then apply the insights I get from  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:34):**  that with my rational mind, the more benefits you'll get, including just being happy. One of  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:39):**  the things I love about what you often talk about is you ask people, are you having fun?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:44):**  If they're not, why not? Go do something else. Go make wine. I'd highly recommend it.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:45:53):**  No, I think that's a fascinating thought though, Greg, in that we are not stewards of the ecosystem.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:00):**  We are the ecosystem. I think if you really stop and think about that, that can strike pretty  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:05):**  deeply. Yeah. Then suddenly doing things like spraying Roundup is defensive. Why does that  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:12):**  make sense? You would never do that yourself, but you are when you're doing that. When we use the  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:19):**  word, we are the ecosystem in the collective sense, particularly on the human side, and then  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:26):**  we look at the human population and we look at the decline in human health, the rapid rise in  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:33):**  degenerative illnesses, et cetera, et cetera. You say, oh, we are the ecosystem. We are an  
**[0:46:38-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:38):**  expression of this ecosystem. That gives you another perspective on thinking about agricultural  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:45):**  soil health and the management systems that we've adopted. Yeah. I guess a quick funny story. I was  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:50):**  giving a presentation to some of our staff members and our wine club members about this new work that  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:46:55):**  we're doing with Advancing EcoAg. I showed them all the results and how we're adjusting all these  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:00):**  things and the plant sap analysis. One of the women up front kind of said, and I go, what's  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:07):**  wrong? Is this bothering you? She goes, no, it's just dawned on me. Your plants eat way better than  
**[0:47:11-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:11):**  I do. That's incredible. It's probably true. Maybe she'll start eating better. Yeah. One of my mentors  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:23):**  many years ago, Gary Zimmer with Midwestern BioAg, where they did a lot of dairy ration work. He used  
**[0:47:29-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:29):**  to make the comment that the cows that we feed eat better than 95% of the American population.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:36):**  Yeah, that's probably true. Yeah, even that's a pretty low bar, unfortunately.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:41):**  But that's part of it to talk about is food is medicine. This is real. It's not only real,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:46):**  it's incredibly important. I think the work that you and you're really helping this community come  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:52):**  together and pull these dispersion pieces of information together, if not makes the most  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:47:57):**  important work to be done, it's right up there. The future of civilization rides on it. Absolutely.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:03):**  Agriculture has the capacity to have the biggest detrimental impact on the planet and on people,  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:08):**  or the biggest positive impact. It's up to us and how we participate in that ecosystem. Yeah,  
**[0:48:13-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:13):**  I agree. Greg, what is a book or resource that you recommend most often? Well, I have a lot because  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:20):**  I teach a fair amount. I have sort of different levels of books. One that I'm actually handing out  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:25):**  to my students a lot as an intro, I used to hand out the Acres USA Primer. It's a little preachy,  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:31):**  some people took it well, some of us didn't. I now hand out The Farm as an Ecosystem by Jerry  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:35):**  Granetti. It's a great overview. It's a great introduction to things, very accessible. People  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:41):**  tend to really like it. If people find meaning in that, I'll usually move them on to Science  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:45):**  and Agriculture with Arden Anderson, another brilliant book. Arden, of course, I just think  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:49):**  the world of Arden. He's just one of those great human beings. Speaking of great human beings,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:52):**  Don Huber, Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease is another great one. If I want to blow their minds,  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:48:57):**  I'll give them a copy of Tuning into Nature by Phil Callahan. That will do it. Yeah, that will do  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:04):**  it. Actually, this is a book I've been able to give to a lot of conventional farmers that for  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:09):**  some reason really resonates with them. It's Nutrition Rules by Graham Tate. I think that's  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:14):**  how you pronounce his last name. Yes, Graham Tate. Full introduction to all the characters  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:19):**  for the series of this. Certain ones will connect with people and they'll get interested in it.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:25):**  For anyone who's actually interested in where winemaking is going, I'd recommend a book called  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:29):**  Postmodern Winemaking by Clark Smith. What else is interesting? To some of my students who want  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:36):**  to get into Ag, I realized a lot of these students have zero background in chemistry. Not that you  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:42):**  have to be a chemist, but you really need a functional knowledge. There's a great book  
**[0:49:46-0:49:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:46):**  called Chemistry Made Simple by John Moore, I think. It's simple. I'll often supplement that  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:53):**  with Khan Academy, KAHN. He has a chemistry series that's online. It's accurate. It's good chemistry.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:49:59):**  It's fun to watch. Of course, Acres USA is a good subscription. Acres is a lot of divergent points  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:07):**  there, but it's a great way of getting exposed to stuff. There's some great resources. Thanks for  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:12):**  sharing those, Greg. Acres is where the seeds were planted that started me down the pathway that  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:17):**  I am on today, for sure. Same here. If it wasn't for Acres, it would have been hard for me to navigate all this.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:23):**  Some of the stuff in there is pretty good. Some of it isn't stuff that I would do,  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:29):**  but it's all in the right vein and it'll all lead you towards something quite a bit better.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:34):**  Greg, we've discussed a number of different topics and I know there's so much more that we could talk  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:39):**  about. What is the question that you wish I would have asked? Two things. We didn't get a chance.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:44):**  I'm doing some interesting student work. Last year, we had a mealybug outbreak and we had no  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:50):**  funding for monitoring through the state. I just organized students and we organized a small  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:50:56):**  growers co-op. I got the small growers together. I meet with them once a month and we've gone from  
**[0:51:01-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:01):**  six members to 220 members in one year. Wow. These guys are really interested in kind of this  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:09):**  cutting-edge stuff. Specifically with the mealybug monitoring, I suddenly had 100 volunteers  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:14):**  and I taught them all how to set mealybug traps. I cheated a little bit. I said if you  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:19):**  bring your trap back every two weeks on time, you can exchange your trap for a free glass of wine.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:24):**  That really helps. That's an awesome incentive. We got really good compliance.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:32):**  What the state had spent five years ago on doing glassy-winged shark shooter, it cost them over  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:38):**  $200,000 to do it in one year by hiring entomologists to go out. We did the whole  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:43):**  program for $5,000 and got better data. It shows the power of kind of citizen science,  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:50):**  which I'm a real fan of now. The other thing that spun out of that is I do a program where we  
**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:51:55):**  teach autistic kids kind of vineyard skills. When I took them out and we started doing field  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:01):**  scouting, these guys are incredible. It turned me around on how I look at kids on the autistic  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:06):**  spectrum in that it's not that they have less capacity. They actually have more capacity.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:12):**  It's just highly focused. If you can help them focus on that, they're incredibly productive,  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:18):**  incredibly happy. They're really nice people. I've been teaching them some of the concepts of  
**[0:52:23-0:52:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:23):**  biological agriculture. One of them asked for the book, What's Making Our Children, I think it's the  
**[0:52:31-0:52:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:31):**  name of it. He came back and said, it's interesting that we're going to be working to help correct the  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:39):**  problem that probably caused my autistic. That just blew me away to say that this kid understood  
**[0:52:43-0:52:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:43):**  that and no malice about it at all. I got dealt kind of a crappy hand. Let's turn it around so  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:50):**  this doesn't happen to anyone else. That's incredible. The other one you didn't ask about  
**[0:52:55-0:53:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:52:55):**  the books, right? You never asked about what music would I recommend. Here's my two expectations.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:03):**  If you want to get a sense musically of that sense of elation when you kind of connect all the dots,  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:09):**  it's Beethoven's 9th Symphony, otherwise known as the Ode to Joy. When I connect the dots,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:15):**  I literally hear that in the back of my head. If I feel like I'm overwhelmed and this isn't going  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:20):**  to work, I'll just crank up the stereo and listen to the Ode to Joy and I'm back on course. The  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:25):**  other one is if you got to clean out your barn, Led Zeppelin, Whole Lotta Love really helps.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:32):**  Greg, sometime soon I'm going to come visit the vineyard and I'm going to expect to hear the Ode  
**[0:53:38-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:38):**  to Joy in the background. Yes, we will make that happen. I hope you can come out too. It's an  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:47):**  interesting area. Actually, if you ever get a chance, I'd love to have you address the Small  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:50):**  Growers Group because quite frankly, they're the innovators in the area and they would be blown  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:53:55):**  away by the work that you're doing. Always happy to share. Greg, thank you so much for being on.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:00):**  I really enjoyed this conversation and wish you success in the work that you're doing in your  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:05):**  vineyard and I'm sure we'll talk again soon. Yeah, thanks John. Same here. I always enjoy talking to  
**[0:54:10-0:54:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:10):**  you and I appreciate how you are really helping to sort of pull us all together at this critical  
**[0:54:17-0:54:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:17):**  inflection point. I think we're at that point and you have identified that and you're playing  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:21):**  a key role and really appreciate having you out there. Thank you. You're welcome. This podcast was  
**[0:54:27-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:27):**  brought to you by a great company that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture, the leader  
**[0:54:34-0:54:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:34):**  in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo to find  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:41):**  more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops. We also believe that healthy plants are  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:47):**  resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants, we must first think differently  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:52):**  about agriculture, about empowering life instead of suppressing life, about regeneration instead  
**[0:54:59-0:55:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:54:59):**  of degeneration. To achieve this, we formulate and sell products that help growers produce higher  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:55:06):**  quality yield with less risk of crop failure. In short, we help growers make more money  
**[0:55:12-0:55:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/microbial-influences-on-crop-quality-with-greg-pennyroyal/#t=0:55:12):**  with less risk. Thank you for listening.

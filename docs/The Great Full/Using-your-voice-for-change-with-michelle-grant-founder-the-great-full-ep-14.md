### The Great Full  (2021-11-28)  
### Author(s): Michelle Grant  

**0:00:00-0:00:08:**  Hi everyone, I'm Michelle Grant and this is The Grateful Podcast, a place where we explore  some of the big challenges we're facing in our food systems and on our planet and try  and understand the role that each of us can play in creating change.  In the second season of the podcast, along with interviews with inspiring women who are  out there creating change, I also wanted to offer you some solo episodes where we dive  
**0:00:28-0:00:33:**  a little bit deeper and highlight some of the challenges that each of us can face on  our own personal or leadership development journey when we're interested to make a contribution  to some of these big global challenges.  And what I want to do in these solo episodes is basically pick a topic that I see coming  up a lot in the coaching programs or the leadership trainings that I run, topics that maybe hold  
**0:00:53-0:00:58:**  us back in some way or another from sharing our gifts with the world and making a contribution  in the way that we would like to.  So the intention behind these solo episodes is to give you some new insights and perhaps  inspiration on these really important topics at the interface of leadership and creating  change in the world, to hopefully help you feel less alone with many of them, the topics  
**0:01:16-0:01:22:**  that in my experience I've carried thinking they were my own challenge to deal with and  the women that I work with in the coaching programs often share that as well, and then  to offers and practical tools and methods that you can use to help move forward with  the particular topic that we're exploring in that episode.  In today's episode, the theme is finding your voice.  
**0:01:43-0:01:49:**  And I decided to start with this theme because if I'm completely honest, it was what was  holding me back from making this first solo episode for about the three or four months  that I procrastinated on it.  And so I thought, why not just tackle the elephant in the room directly and share with  you my process when I feel a little bit challenged in terms of speaking up, using my voice, taking  
**0:02:11-0:02:17:**  up space, and to hopefully give you some ways that you can move forward if this is showing  up for you and your work and your life as well.  So this episode is really for you if you're perhaps called to create something, put something  out into the world that you think can be of service or impact others, but you feel held  back by a lot of doubts about your own value or the value of the idea that you had.  
**0:02:41-0:02:46:**  It's an episode for you if you're perhaps stepping into a new leadership role or considering  stepping into a new role and you feel held back by a lot of questions about how to do  that and how to really take up your space there.  It's also for you if you're perhaps feeling like you're hovering in the background, like  you have a lot of potential, a lot of things that you would like to share, but you feel  
**0:03:11-0:03:16:**  a lot of fear, a lot of restriction, perhaps a lot of procrastination holding you back  from actually doing what you're called to do.  Now I am not at all unfamiliar with these topics and actually that's why I really wanted  to pick them up in the first episode because there's been several times when this challenge  of really finding and using my own voice, taking up space, creating and putting something  
**0:03:40-0:03:46:**  out in the world has felt really challenging for me and it continues to be so, which I  think is the case for all of us.  It's not that these challenges go away, but we find new ways to work with them and to  dance with them and that's what I really want to share with you today.  So I can give you a couple of concrete examples where I've had this challenge showing up for  
**0:04:02-0:04:10:**  me and it's always in a situation where I'm either asked to or somehow called to put something  out into the world and by extension put myself out into the world, perhaps more than is naturally  comfortable for me.  So I felt this this morning when I was procrastinating on getting this episode done and out to you.  I've experienced it when sitting down to write a book a couple of years ago and I've also  
**0:04:30-0:04:36:**  experienced it when being hired into a new role or stepping into a leadership role, which  maybe at the time felt like a little bit of a stretch for me and then all of a sudden  having to hold space for a team facilitate processes, give big presentations or speak  on behalf of groups of people.  And in all of those situations, what I recognize showing up is just a hesitation, a kind of  
**0:04:58-0:05:04:**  resistance to do the thing I need to do in a way that it leaves me kind of spinning around  it procrastinating on it, but in a very frustrating way, you know, I really want to do this thing,  but I have feel held back by something and I can't quite put my finger on what it is.  So on the surface, I might just be telling myself that I'm too busy and I don't have  time but when I take the space and have the courage to really look at it, there's a lot  
**0:05:24-0:05:27:**  of other things going on under the surface.  There are topics that I'm spinning around in my mind.  There are sensations in the body.  There are emotions that are coming up and when I've had the tools and the support to  look at these that's when I'm actually able to move forward and learn an awful lot in  
**0:05:45-0:05:47:**  the process.  So as I'm describing these challenges associated with stepping into your potential, finding  your voice, sharing something you're called to with the world and wondering what's coming  up for you, is there anywhere in your work or life where you're experiencing this at  the moment?  
**0:06:07-0:06:12:**  Is it creating any suffering or struggle for you?  And how is that showing up?  Are you discussing it with anyone or are you trying to work it out on your own?  So I know for myself when I first recognized these challenges showing up for me, I absolutely  just tried to work it all out on my own and that only led me so far.  
**0:06:39-0:06:44:**  It was when I started sharing with other people, getting the support of coaches, looking at  resources and tools and hearing other people's stories that I was really able to see that  my experience was not actually a personal and lonely one as I thought but rather it  was something shared with anyone when they feel called to speak up about things that  they really care about, to create new things and put them out into the world or to take  
**0:07:09-0:07:16:**  on new roles and responsibilities and to really step into our potential in making a contribution.  And the first thing that I think is important for all of us when we start to explore these  topics is that we come to them with both curiosity and compassion.  And I kind of created this word for this, composity, because I think these are the two  most important mindsets and approaches for any sort of personal development or leadership  
**0:07:38-0:07:41:**  development work that we do.  And when we have that compassion and that curiosity, we can start to peel underneath  the surface of what's going on.  Peel underneath the stories of, oh, well, I would be doing it, but I'm just too busy  or, oh, no, it's much better if that other person does it or I'm not quite ready yet.  
**0:07:57-0:08:03:**  All of these excuses that we use when we're hitting this discomfort of really taking up  our space in the world.  And if we're willing to look underneath these surface topics and come to the deeper issues,  what we find there is not always easy to face.  Often we find fears of not being good enough, a fear of being vulnerable or unsafe if we  
**0:08:25-0:08:31:**  put ourselves out into the world, a fear of perhaps being wrong.  Even if we are very convinced about something, there might be a doubt in the back of our  mind.  Well, is this really right?  Perhaps there's a fear of being misunderstood, sharing something and having it misinterpreted  
**0:08:46-0:08:53:**  of upsetting people or speaking out and not being likable anymore.  Maybe there's a worry about the burden of the responsibility that comes with that thing  that you're thinking of doing.  And maybe associated with that, a worry that if you do it, you're actually going to pay  a big cost yourself, that you're maybe not going to be able to take care of yourself  
**0:09:09-0:09:17:**  how you need to, or that you're going to constantly have to overstep your own boundaries.  And all of these fears are completely normal, completely a part of the human experience.  And it's not to say that any of them are going to go away.  But what we can do is learn to manage ourselves differently and lead ourselves through a process  where these fears don't hold us back anymore, where they don't stop us from sharing things  
**0:09:37-0:09:41:**  that the world actually needs, to instead be able to acknowledge that they're there  and instead choose another way forward, led by something other than fear.  Now when it comes to putting ourselves out there, the underlying fears and the underlying  struggles are really, really personal.  They show up differently for each of us.  
**0:10:00-0:10:07:**  Of course, what's coming up depends a lot on our own individual lived experiences, the  intersection of our different identities, our own way of seeing and interpreting the  world, and how we've internalized different things that we've been socialized to do.  As a lot of my work is focused with women in this space, that often means addressing  what we've internalized around how we show up in the world.  
**0:10:36-0:10:42:**  Many of us in many cultures have been socialized to be friendly and quiet and not rock the  boat and help everybody else.  These are all in themselves not terrible things, but they can sometimes rub up against speaking  out or making a stand or going against what is the status quo.  When it comes to creating change in the world, we're always going to have to go against the  
**0:11:04-0:11:11:**  status quo, and so that means we are often called to face head on these different things  that we've internalized.  We also have to understand that putting ourselves out there in the world, being more visible,  does feel vulnerable, and that can immediately wake up the safety instinct that each of us  have, these protective mechanisms that we've built up in our personality to make ourselves  
**0:11:35-0:11:38:**  feel and perhaps appear to be safer.  That's just all to say that tackling all of these topics are not exactly comfortable,  and maybe it's nice, as I said before, if we can come at them with both compassion and  curiosity for ourselves and for what's going on.  But here's why I think it's super important for us to face what's holding us back in being  
**0:12:01-0:12:05:**  more visible or using our voice.  Because there's a cost to it.  There's a cost to each of us as individuals, perhaps that unpleasant feeling of being held  back, of not really sharing our gifts with the world as we would like to.  There's the potential that we have regrets in the future for not having done that.  
**0:12:27-0:12:34:**  And I think that when we are restricted or held back in this way, it also impacts our  happiness.  One of my favorite definitions of happiness is from the author Shawn Aker, who describes  happiness as the joy you feel moving towards your potential.  Though I do think it's nice to add to that happiness is the joy you feel moving towards  
**0:12:54-0:12:58:**  your potential in line with your values.  I think it's really important to add that in line with your values part.  But if that is how we understand happiness, then that moving towards our potential does  often require us to step out of our comfort zone and to be maybe more visible and take  up more space than we are right now.  
**0:13:16-0:13:21:**  The other cost to us not doing this is of course for other people.  Because if you're not sharing your gifts and your experience and your perspective with  the world, then it means that other people don't get to benefit from your ideas, from  your insights, from your experience, from your learnings.  And that's a great loss to many people.  
**0:13:38-0:13:42:**  There's also a cost to our planet as well.  We are in a pretty dire situation right now.  We have intersecting climate biodiversity and sustainability challenges.  And the world really needs each of us to show up with our gifts and make our contribution  in a way that's also sustainable for us.  
**0:14:00-0:14:07:**  And I know from many years working in these spaces that there is not enough diversity  at the table in terms of who is framing the challenges, who is shaping the dialogue, and  who is co-creating the solutions.  And so we need people who are perhaps not currently taking up space to do so.  And I am not at all ignoring the huge systemic and societal changes that need to happen for  
**0:14:28-0:14:30:**  that to take place.  But I also acknowledge that we have aspects of that internalized inside of ourselves.  And so we need to overcome those so that we can step up and take our space at the table  to shape these dialogues and shape these solutions that we want to see.  When it comes to creating change in ourselves, it's important that we acknowledge that the  
**0:14:52-0:14:56:**  first step is becoming aware of what's actually going on.  The second step is to understand it better.  And then the third step is to take action or change our practices, change the ways that  we're doing things, and continually practice those until we have the change that we're  looking for.  
**0:15:13-0:15:18:**  And so with any of this work, the first invitation is always to get more curious about what's  going on.  Perhaps asking yourself, is there a place in my work or my life where I would really  like to be taking up more space, speaking up more loudly, creating and sharing something  different?  
**0:15:34-0:15:39:**  And I'm not doing it at the moment because I feel held back in some way.  I feel fear and resistance and doubt, and it's keeping me staying smaller and safe rather  than stepping out in the way that I would like to.  And as we start to become aware of that, just simply noticing how it's showing up for us  in the moments when we do feel that resistance or that stuckness.  
**0:15:58-0:16:01:**  What's happening in the body?  What's happening in your mind?  What's happening emotionally for you?  And as we start to observe ourselves at these three different levels, we also start to connect  with the different centres of intelligence that each of us have.  
**0:16:15-0:16:21:**  In our society and in our education system, we're so conditioned to only rely on the mind  as a source of intelligence, but our body is a source of wisdom, our emotions are sources  of intelligence, and becoming more aware of what's happening with them can also give  us really interesting and important information to help us get unstuck as well.  Once we've become a little bit more aware of what's going on, and we've understood it  
**0:16:44-0:16:50:**  more deeply and the particular flavour of it that's showing up for us, we can start  to play with some tools and practices to see if it can support us to move to a different  place.  So I'd love to share with you four practices that I have found really helpful in my journey  to use my voice and create and share things with more fluidity and more flow than I have  
**0:17:09-0:17:16:**  in the past.  So tip number one, make it an exploration, not a destination.  I know for me one of the challenges I have when I'm trying to create something and share  it in the world is I feel really stalled around sharing anything until I feel I have all of  the answers.  
**0:17:39-0:17:43:**  And the challenge with that is I'm often interested in really complex challenges, and I dare say  there is never a single answer.  And so waiting until I try and find that means that I'm never ever going to share anything.  I experienced this really intensely in writing a book a couple of years ago.  I wanted to integrate information and inspiration around the challenges we're facing in our  
**0:18:03-0:18:09:**  food system and what we can do to tackle them into a very practical format of a cookbook  so that people were engaging with this topic in a really hands-on way.  And one of the biggest challenges I had there was that I felt I had to answer all of the  questions and all of the issues and provide solutions to everything before I could even  think about putting this book out in the world.  
**0:18:28-0:18:31:**  And that, of course, meant that I just never felt that it was finished and it never felt  like it included everything that I wanted it to.  And thank God, because then it would have been like a 17-volume, I don't know, 15,000-page  book instead of a brightly designed 200-page digestible book that people actually want  to interact with.  
**0:18:51-0:18:57:**  So what helped me really move ahead here was basically to step back from seeing my role  and seeing what I was trying to do as providing answers to everybody and instead frame this  entire book writing experience as a journey that I was going on for my own personal development.  Now, that might sound very selfish.  However, what it helped me to do is just reframe the whole experience as a learning journey,  
**0:19:21-0:19:25:**  as an exploration process around things that I was interested in.  And it took away this burden of feeling like I was having to provide all the answers to  all of the people.  So what I did is sat down, I got myself a journal and wrote at the start of the journal,  why am I doing this project?  
**0:19:43-0:19:46:**  And the why is just for me.  What do I want to explore and learn through this process?  And then I just got everything out in bullet points that I wanted to focus on while I went  through this journey.  I then asked myself, okay, well, if that's what I'm interested to learn and that's how  
**0:20:03-0:20:07:**  I want to develop through this process, then what are some small steps that I can get started  with that feel like I'm leaving my comfort zone, but just going into the stretch zone,  not into the extreme discomfort zone?  And how can I just take one of those steps and then take the next step and so on and  so forth.  
**0:20:20-0:20:24:**  And by reframing this as a learning journey, what it really helped me to acknowledge is  that in all of these processes, the gold is actually in the struggle.  What we learn and how we grow is exactly because of the struggles and the challenges that we  face in the process.  That's where we are able to develop new capacities, where we're able to expand our understanding,  
**0:20:45-0:20:47:**  expand our capabilities.  And that's never a very comfortable thing.  So it really helped me to just reframe those moments of struggle I felt with this book,  which honestly happened on a daily, if not hourly basis and to try and understand, okay,  well, what am I learning in this moment?  
**0:21:00-0:21:05:**  What am I learning to face or dance with or deal with in a different way?  And I also kept a journal of this process.  So just like I wrote down what I wanted to experience and explore in the beginning, I  also journaled the whole way through how that experience was going.  So I could constantly check in with myself and remind myself that that was an important  
**0:21:19-0:21:27:**  part of this process as much as the object or output of the entire process.  I also realised after about six months of procrastinating of writing this book, that  I was trying to face this struggle all alone and that there was no way I was going to get  to the finish line of the project without building myself a support network.  And so I think as we're facing these challenges, really to ask ourselves, what would feeling  
**0:21:46-0:21:50:**  supported look like for me in this process?  And to then ask for that support.  That might be getting a coach.  It might be finding a group of people going through a similar experience, a community  that is exploring the similar questions that you're exploring.  
**0:22:03-0:22:08:**  And then you can all help each other to mine the gold in each of your personal struggles  and see that they're not really personal, but actually collective.  And I think being community gives us an amazing opportunity to immediately share our lessons  with others as we go through this process.  So often people only share lessons after they are, they have mastered something or appear  
**0:22:28-0:22:32:**  extremely successful in conventional terms.  And I think that's such a pity because if we would share more when we're in, you know,  when we're in the trenches and we're really struggling, then I think we would all see  that we're really not alone with what we're dealing with.  Second tip.  
**0:22:47-0:22:52:**  Do you want to lead with fear or love?  This is a little practice that developed out of the work of two amazing writers, Elizabeth  Gilbert, who you might know.  She wrote an amazing book called Big Magic, Creative Living Beyond Fear.  And there she talks extensively about how we can work with fear when it comes up in  
**0:23:10-0:23:12:**  our creative pursuits.  And she doesn't frame creativity just as painting or writing.  It's really whenever we're designing and bringing forth anything new in the world.  I also have really appreciated the work of Marianne Williamson on talking about fear  and love as being the two major motivators for everything we do as human beings.  
**0:23:33-0:23:37:**  And so from the work of these two women, I've come to do a practice which I find really  supportive.  If I'm worried about something, avoiding something, not being visible in the way I need to, I  like to sit down, again with a journal, draw a big line down the middle of the page.  On the one side write fear, on the other side write love or wisdom, if love feels like a  
**0:23:59-0:24:03:**  word that isn't resonating for you here.  Then I take a pen and I go over to the side that says fear and I say fear.  It's your turn to share everything that you're thinking about.  Off you go.  And as Elizabeth Gilbert says, effectively hand fear the microphone and then let it write  
**0:24:19-0:24:26:**  on the page everything that it's fearful about in relation to this thing that you are avoiding  doing.  Once you feel like you have vomited everything out onto the page, pause for a moment, thank  fear for what it's doing to try and take care of you and for sharing its insights, and then  acknowledge there is actually another perspective that I would like to give space for here.  
**0:24:48-0:24:53:**  So love or wisdom, here's the microphone for you, what do you want to tell me about this  situation?  And just as you did with fear, allow love or wisdom to write everything it wants you  to hear on the page.  At the end you can thank it for its insights and then take a look at these two sides of  
**0:25:10-0:25:16:**  the page and ask yourself which side do I want to lead from?  And once you've decided on which side, ask yourself what does that look like in terms  of the next step I want to take right now?  Because I think somatic awareness and working with the body is an incredible vehicle for  creating change.  
**0:25:31-0:25:36:**  To also check in with your body, how does it feel physically when I'm in this place  of fear around this topic or this thing that I need to do?  And how does it feel physically when I'm in a place of love or wisdom in relation to it?  And observe those changes in your body and just simply bringing your body into that state  can already help you when you show up to do that thing, to do it from a very different  
**0:25:59-0:26:02:**  foundation.  The third tip, get the inner critic out of the driver's seat.  So very much in relation to the idea of fear is this inner critic that all of us have that  often starts screaming extremely loudly as soon as we want to step out of our comfort  zone in any way, shape or form.  
**0:26:26-0:26:30:**  We all have these inner critic, it probably will be with us for life.  The question is, is it completely running the show or do we need to perhaps have a new  way of working with it where again, we can show up and lead from a different place?  And when it comes to the topic of the inner critic, the person whose work has influenced  me and supported me the most here is Tara Moore.  
**0:26:50-0:26:58:**  So she wrote a really important book called Playing Big, which is all about helping women  to play bigger on their own terms, whatever that means for them.  And I've also done the Playing Big Facilitators training with her, which is a wonderful training  program sharing how you can utilize these tools to support others.  And the one tool that I find really helpful is her work with the inner critic.  
**0:27:18-0:27:22:**  And if you're interested to explore this, you can find a lot on her website or you can  find it in the Playing Big book.  But the basic idea is to first of all, check in in these moments when you're feeling you're  holding yourself back from playing bigger in whatever way that means for you.  To observe again what's happening in the body and to observe that voice that's perhaps being  
**0:27:44-0:27:48:**  critical or judgmental of you at that time.  Maybe the voice that's saying, oh, you don't know enough to do that yet, or no wait, you're  not ready for that yet.  Or who do you think you are to do that?  Or there's enough noise in the world, don't add to it.  
**0:28:04-0:28:06:**  Or that's already been done.  What's original here?  What value does your idea or your contribution have here?  All of those voices that we all have.  This is the inner critic at play.  
**0:28:17-0:28:19:**  Most of the time we're completely identifying with this inner critic.  And so it's really hard for us to get any perspective from it or to have any perspective  other than the one it is offering to us.  So the first step that we can do to work with it is to simply start observing this voice  and to use a tool that psychologists call self distancing.  
**0:28:37-0:28:41:**  And this is becoming the observer of ourselves.  Imagining that there's basically another version of us sitting over our shoulder observing  everything that we do with a really non-judgmental and caring presence.  And when we start to self distance in that way and observe this inner critic, we can  start to hear a little bit better what it's telling us.  
**0:29:02-0:29:08:**  And to help us self distance even further, what we can do is create a character for this  inner critic.  So as we sense how it shows up in terms of how we feel in the body, emotionally, mentally,  as we hear the type of words that it uses, the tone of voice that it has, we can actually  start to attach a character to that.  
**0:29:25-0:29:29:**  It shouldn't be ourselves, it shouldn't be someone that we're close in relationship with,  and it might not even be an actual character, it might be something like a color or a texture.  Basically giving this voice a character distinct from ourselves, because it's not our full  self.  Then we're able to start to observe when's that character showing up.  
**0:29:48-0:29:55:**  We're also able to perhaps invite it out of the space kindly when it's taking up too much  space.  Imagining it leaving through the window or exiting our body or going to sleep or whatever  it needs to do.  And then asking ourselves, what core value would I actually want to lead with here?  
**0:30:09-0:30:13:**  And there's a lot more nuance to this tool that you can definitely dive into through  Tara Moore's work, so I just really recommend checking out her book.  But it's wonderful even just to start this process of observing and maybe even journaling  about this inner critic and how it's starting to scream whenever you're considering to step  out of the comfort zone.  
**0:30:30-0:30:35:**  The fourth and final tip for taking up more space, using our voice and being more visible  is, you can't control the outcome.  So I know for myself when it's been around making podcast episodes or writing a book  or even giving a huge presentation to a room full of people, sometimes what really stalls  me is this worry about how it's going to be perceived.  
**0:30:59-0:31:00:**  How is it going to land?  Will people understand it?  Will there be pushback, etc, etc.  And that can be really paralyzing unless it's dealt with in a different way.  And what's really helped me is just a realization that if I put something out into the world,  
**0:31:15-0:31:20:**  and by extension of it myself, I cannot control how people respond to that.  I cannot control what impact it has.  The only thing I can control is the intention with which I show up to do it, how I show  up through the process, and the mindset I have in engaging with people who respond to  it in some way.  
**0:31:36-0:31:41:**  I've realized that it's not actually my responsibility to make sure that it makes sense for everybody  or that everybody feels good about everything.  Indeed, it's even the case where people disagree strongly that I can have the most interesting  insights and learnings myself.  So this idea of releasing control of the outcome of knowing when my work is done, and letting  
**0:31:58-0:32:04:**  the rest be up to something bigger than me has just been really freeing in actually putting  things out into the world.  So there are four tips that I hope can help you in your journey.  Firstly, make it an exploration, not a destination.  Secondly, do you want to lead with fear or love?  
**0:32:18-0:32:22:**  Third, get the inner critic out of the driver's seat.  And finally, you can't control the outcome.  Working with all these tools doesn't mean that the fear and the doubt and the hesitation  won't show up.  It probably will for all of us always.  
**0:32:35-0:32:38:**  And it doesn't mean it won't feel uncomfortable along the way.  But it does mean we're going to learn an awful lot in the process.  And we're going to allow our gifts and our contribution to make it out into the world,  which is where they belong.  The world really needs you and your talents and your gifts and your voice right now.  
**0:32:54-0:32:59:**  We need diverse perspectives at the table to understand our problems and co-create solutions.  And I hope that some of these tools can help you tackle some of the challenges that we  inevitably face along that path.  The most important thing that I have had to learn is that you don't have to do it alone.  Look for support from friends and family and colleagues.  
**0:33:19-0:33:24:**  But perhaps also look out of your immediate vicinity and try and find communities or coaches  who are really trained to support in these processes.  Having experienced these things myself and the positive impact that it's had, that's  been a major kind of motivator and driver for me.  Setting up the coaching programs, the trainings and the communities that are grateful for  
**0:33:42-0:33:48:**  women who are looking to lead sustainable change from the inside out.  So there were quite a few different things to digest in this episode.  Perhaps you want to take a moment now to take a few deep breaths, reflect on what you've  heard and maybe journal about one of these tips or tricks that you might want to practice  or an insight that you want to work with over the coming days.

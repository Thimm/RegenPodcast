### The Great Full  (2020-09-14)  
### Author(s): Michelle Grant  

**0:00:00-0:00:07:**  Hi, I'm Michelle, and this is The Great Full Podcast.  For about as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by how creating a sustainable  world can start with each of us.  That might be through the food that's on our plate, the choices we make about how we  live our lives, or how we lead ourselves and others.  
**0:00:24-0:00:30:**  I also think that whatever we do to create change has to be sustainable on a personal  level.  So in this podcast, I'll share conversations with some thinkers and doers working in the  food and sustainability world and throw in some of my own insights from working in this  space.  
**0:00:44-0:00:54:**  All to give you new ideas on how to contribute through how you eat, live and lead.

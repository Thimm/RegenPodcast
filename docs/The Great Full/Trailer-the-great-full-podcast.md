### The Great Full  (2020-09-14)  
### Author(s): Michelle Grant  

**0:00:00-0:00:15:**  Hi, I'm Michelle, and this is The Great Full Podcast.  For about as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by how creating a sustainable  world can start with each of us.  
**0:00:15-0:00:30:**  That might be through the food that's on our plate, the choices we make about how we  live our lives, or how we lead ourselves and others.  I also think that whatever we do to create change has to be sustainable on a personal  
**0:00:30-0:00:43:**  level.  So in this podcast, I'll share conversations with some thinkers and doers working in the  food and sustainability world and throw in some of my own insights from working in this  
**0:00:43-0:00:54:**  space.  All to give you new ideas on how to contribute through how you eat, live and lead.

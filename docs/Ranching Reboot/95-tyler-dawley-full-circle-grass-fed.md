For the last two years I've been taking grass fed beef organ supplements.  A few months ago I reached out to several different brands and I'm pleased to announce  
**[0:02:52-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:02:52):**  that I found a brand that I can align with.  Introducing OneEarthHealth.com grass fed and finished beef organ supplements.  Look we all know that the liver is one of the most nutrient dense foods available.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:03:02):**  Packed with iron and B vitamins, it's a great source of choline and folate.  Sourced from grass fed and finished cattle with no fillers.  I take the beef liver blend and the organs blend which includes spleen, pancreas, kidney,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:03:14):**  heart and yeah, a little more liver.  I take them every day and I feel great except want to forget.  Then I notice I have less energy and less focus.

**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:03:47):**  I am so much better.  You even sound better.  You look a little bit better.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:03:53):**  So yeah, great to see you again, man.  Yeah, no, I was, I was hurting like the top of my mouth.  I don't know.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:01):**  It was just weird.  Like the top of my mouth was swollen.  Like I got a bee sting.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:06):**  It was a weird, painful sore throat.  Just so everybody knows what we're talking about.  We're doing this a week later than we planned or almost a week later than we planned because  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:15):**  Tyler wasn't feeling well.  We had the room on schedule, so we just went ahead and moved back a week.  So welcome to the show.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:22):**  It's great to have you.  Why don't you start off by telling us a little bit about Tyler and where you're at.  Sure.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:32):**  So I'm Tyler.  We're Big Bluff Ranch.  We are physically where we are at.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:38):**  We are in Northern California.  So we're about two hours north of Sacramento.  We're in the Sacramento Valley.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:46):**  We are just outside of the fertile grounds of where all the walnuts and prunes and almonds  are grown.  And we're not all the way up into the timber country where all the other fortunes are made.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:04:58):**  So we're right there in the middle of no man's land.  And we've been here since about 1960.  Grandpa bought the ranch then.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:05:07):**  And we've been kind of on organic, regenerative, holistic management journey since the early  80s.  My dad went to a conference with Alan Savory back in the early 80s.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:05:26):**  Back when he was...  I think is when he was 82, 83, 84.  I think he was when he was around the west and the southwest.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:05:33):**  Yep.  Yep.  And we were right there at the very beginning.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:05:38):**  So I would have been, I don't know, fourth, fifth grade, something like that when he saw  him.  And so essentially, that's all I've ever kind of known is how we've done that.  
**[0:05:49-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:05:49):**  And we've just been going farther and farther down that path.  So we built lots of fences and put in lots of water troughs and water points.  You know, we actually did do the mythical double your carrying capacity for the ranch,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:06:08):**  which was pretty fun.  So you know, bought another ranch for free or whatever kind of the fun saying is.  Then that led us in the 90s to messing around with genetics, our beef genetics.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:06:21):**  So we started buying bulls from the Hatfields, Dock and County Hatfield, who were the founding  members of Oregon, I think they're Oregon Country beef at the time, and now they're  Oregon Natural beef.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:06:38):**  It doesn't really matter.  But they were, they were, you know, short wide cows.  And we started messing around with that and got pretty decent genetics for grass fed beef,  
**[0:06:49-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:06:49):**  not really meaning to but we were trying to get, you know, low supplement on our cows  we were going for the least cost production.  So we didn't want to buy winter hay, we didn't want to buy supplements that we didn't have  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:02):**  to.  So we were trying to fit the genetics to our environment.  I hope that'll make sense.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:06):**  Right?  Yeah, it was just cows grass water, you know, if you're kind of adding all that much more  to that equation, you're probably making it harder than it needs to be.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:16):**  I would agree.  Yeah.  And then we tried to well then, then Michael Pollan wrote an article in 2000, or 1999 2000  
**[0:07:27-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:27):**  called power steer in the New Yorker, I believe it was.  And that really was the beginning of the grass fed beef movement.  People knew about it before then, but he really blew it up where he followed the life of one  
**[0:07:41-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:41):**  steer from weaning through backgrounding, I don't remember exactly what through the  feedlot and the processing plant and freaked out a lot of people about that process.  And this is when a lot of people are like, hey, and at the end of it, his alternative  
**[0:07:56-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:07:56):**  was a grass fed beef, he bought a steer from someone and put it in his freezer and was  like, Oh, this is amazing.  And so that, let's be honest, if the general public knew everything that happened to that  
**[0:08:09-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:09):**  steer after it left the pasture, between pasture and the plate, they that's probably that's  why veganism is winning.  Like, let's be real.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:19):**  That's why they're winning is because of the production practices, not just in feedlots,  but in hog and chicken barns, too.  Right.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:28):**  Right.  Yeah, you know, it's no, no one wants to know how the sausage is made.  All they want to do is eat it.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:35):**  Right.  So anyways, we started doing grass fed beef, I was at farmers markets with with our grass  fed beef in the 2000s.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:44):**  We tried grass fed lamb grass fed goat, you know, which was great from a production standpoint,  because we have lots of hills and we have lots of brush.  But not many people eat it.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:08:56):**  And they are a very full time management deal.  Like you don't kind of passively raise those guys, you're you're paying attention to them  a lot.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:09:04):**  And we didn't have the capacity to raise them the way we should.  So we got out of those guys, we tried a little bit of chicken.  And we did a good job by the chicken, but we ended up hand processing and scalding them  
**[0:09:19-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:09:19):**  over the kitchens sink, you know, so you had this the wet chicken feather smell, what chicken  manure smell in the house.  So my mom was like, No, no, no, no chickens until it's processing day.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:09:33):**  Exactly.  So we're like, Okay, new rule for legs only.  So we yeah, we got out of chickens and we're like, Well, the only thing left is pork, right.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:09:44):**  So we went into pasture pork.  And not knowing what we didn't know, we didn't know that.  Well, we did know we had a lot of wild pigs around but we didn't know that pigs, wild  
**[0:09:55-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:09:55):**  pigs, you know, you can train pigs to electric fence, I absolutely don't deny that.  But when you get a wild boar who backs up about 50 yards away goes at a full sprint  to like zip through that electric fence to get your to your domestic sow and heat, like,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:14):**  it doesn't really matter.  There's not a whole lot that's going to hold that back.  Now.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:19):**  Now.  So So our our domestic pig program was just basically half wild pig.  So the little only didn't turn out well.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:30):**  No, it didn't really didn't the genetics were weird.  They're their personalities were weird.  So anyways, got out of pigs.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:42):**  And we're like, well, let's get back.  What do we get back into everyone else was around with beef.  No, still is the case today.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:49):**  No one is valuing the beef correctly.  So you're just like, there's no way you're making money at this price.  You are losing money.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:10:57):**  But no, they don't even know that.  So anyways, the only thing that was left was chickens and we're like, well, no one's dumb  enough to do chickens.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:11:06):**  We're kind of dumb.  So let's do some chickens.  So we got into it.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:11:11):**  We got up to about 1800 head a year processing on farm reached a point where no one would  answer their phone anymore when it was time to process them.  Kind of like you just said processing chickens, everyone loves it until you start processing  
**[0:11:24-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:11:24):**  them.  So then we I went to a conference ran into a guy who could raise or who can sell more  than he could raise and I could raise more than I could sell.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:11:34):**  And that was pretty much when we flip the switch over towards a contract growing situation  where we were growing for someone else and they would put their label on it and distribute  it out round through the Bay Area, which is about four hours away from us.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:11:51):**  And that was what we've done for the past 12ish years, 13ish years until COVID kind  of blew that all kaboom.  And we've built a boom and a good or kaboom and a bad.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:12:04):**  Actually it was kind of both at the same time.  Okay, first it was a bad kaboom.  So our big 10 year old contract went away.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:12:14):**  But then it went kaboom in a good way because we picked up another contract without missing  a harvest, which was just unbelievable.  They wanted more chicken for more money and we're like, Whoa, all right.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:12:27):**  And but then they went kaboom.  So it was, it was kind of a topsy turvy turn.  So we've built back some of our wholesale business, but the wholesale world has changed  
**[0:12:41-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:12:41):**  since we kind of first got started.  So we're trying to get a direct to consumer program up and going.  So that's kind of kind of my big thing these days is we've got the wholesale stuff chunking  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:12:54):**  along in the background.  If it gets better, that'd be great.  But really, we're trying to go back to our roots of direct to consumer and, you know,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:13:02):**  capture that whole dollar and even above and beyond the dollar just to talk to the people  about what we're doing, right?  That it's, it is perfectly pleasant to just ship your animals off to the slaughterhouse  
**[0:13:14-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:13:14):**  and get a nice big check.  But there is something intangible about like having someone say, I haven't had a chicken  that good since my grandma made it for me when I was five years old, you know, that's  
**[0:13:26-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:13:26):**  pretty fun to get that sort of feedback.  So can't really put a dollar on it, but it's definitely worth going after.  Or when somebody says, man, this is what I remember steak tasting like, yeah, I'm doing  
**[0:13:39-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:13:39):**  something right.  So you said that your contract growing chickens and for some reason that makes the hair on  the back of my neck stand up because I've read Meat Racket, I've read Wastelands and  
**[0:13:51-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:13:51):**  it's Meat Racket is about how Tyson took over the chicken industry and Wastelands is about  how pork run off, how waste from hog, primarily hog, but also to some extent chicken farms  in big confinement barns affect their neighbors in North Carolina and Wastelands was talking  
**[0:14:12-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:14:12):**  about some lawsuits.  And you know, I don't think big cattle feedlots are any different.  Don't know how many y'all or Tyler, if you've ever driven through the Texas pan, Texas and  
**[0:14:23-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:14:23):**  Oklahoma panhandle, Southwest Kansas, it was, I've never been, I've never driven past a  feedlot and gone, Oh man, what a nice place that smells good.  You know, that looks like it's such a good environment to live in.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:14:40):**  I've never driven past one and thought that.  Nope.  So maybe, do you understand what I'm talking about when I like, when I have like some kind  
**[0:14:52-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:14:52):**  of red flags when I hear contract with chickens, can you maybe explain how that's not the situation  you're in, like with a Tyson or a Smithfield or something like that?  No.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:04):**  Yeah.  So when I say I get my business terms mixed up, right?  I'm a yo-yo reason chicken.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:10):**  So in my mind, a contract is where I'm growing a product.  Someone else is putting their label on it and selling it on.  So they could have also been buying from another past or poultry guy, toe mingling our production,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:24):**  putting the same label on it, moving it on down the value chain.  So in my mind, that's a contract.  The buyer and I would sit down yearly and be like, okay, you know, how many had delivered  
**[0:15:34-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:34):**  for what month for what dollar?  I suppose the difference would be like, you know, one of the big chicken houses that they  would provide you the birds.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:46):**  They would tell you what to feed them.  They would sell you the feed.  They would have their flock health consultant come out and inspect your facilities.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:15:56):**  Is it something like that?  Or are you more making the call of what birds you're going to buy, how you're going to feed  them and you just deliver?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:04):**  Yeah.  Well, I call it contract growing.  You're actually the only person who's ever called me out on it.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:11):**  So I'm not calling on you.  We are not a chicken contract.  I am not at all anything at all like what Purdue does.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:21):**  We're not or Tyson or whoever.  We're not a tournament system.  We're not doing anything.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:27):**  This is a contracted out growing arrangement, much more like if you were to bring on a set  of stockers where you're like, hey, you know, they're coming on at this weight, we're going  to pay this much gain, and they're going to come off at this date.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:41):**  And this is the contracted agreement to how we get paid.  So it's when I say contract, it's much more that the guy and I sat down, figured out the  parameters of what he wanted, volume, weight, deliverables.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:16:58):**  And then I said, Okay, well, this is the price I need to hit those deliverables.  And then we signed the contract and we went on from there.  So now the what the conventional guys do those farmers, I mean, it's pretty horrible.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:17:12):**  They're like, you know, in surfs, or, you know, it's, I don't even understand how people  are still doing that.  It's hard for me to call that contract growing.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:17:21):**  Like, okay, in my mind, you know, it's kind of what you said.  I take them in by the head by the day or on gain rate, or whatever, and get paid on pounds  or animals delivered and days that were here.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:17:33):**  And I guess that's kind of still the model in a hog or a chicken barn.  But when you know, the big when the big company, you know, I don't really want to get sued,  which I might someday but Tyson, so let's just say Tyson because they're, you know,  
**[0:17:52-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:17:52):**  there's already been a book written about it.  They sell you that they provide you the birds.  They provide the feed, they provide the veterinary technical assistance.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:18:03):**  You know, they got a guy that shows up once a week to tell you how to run your barn.  And you're every day.  And then they tell you when they're going to drop them off when they're going to pick  
**[0:18:11-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:18:11):**  them up.  Like, so what is in that case, like, what is the farmer's actual responsibility past  making sure those birds stay alive for three months, and there's as many of them as possible.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:18:24):**  It's not a good production model that gives any sort of thought to the wealth, the actual  welfare of the animals, what kind of you know, how they're living, or really the welfare  of the workers that have to work there.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:18:42):**  Yeah, no, it's not good.  I would say that the economic incentive is for a cheap protein source and that I'm actually  very far removed from that world.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:18:56):**  But I could see how if the economic incentive is changed to something else, like for instance,  the chicken industry has reduced their antibiotic use by some large percentage.  And that is all driven by consumers that somehow the consumers like I don't want superbugs,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:19:17):**  no more soap therapeutic or antibiotic use.  And the big chicken companies didn't really want to go down that route because it's easier  when you can crack open some, you know, antibiotics and you're good to go.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:19:32):**  But that the consumer demand was so strong, and it's still so strong that they are having  to figure out how to go antibiotic free, not because they want to, but because that's what  the market is compelling them to.  
**[0:19:48-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:19:48):**  So there are ways where I you can, I mean, I don't know the answer.  But I can see that if you had an economic incentive different than what there is out  there now, that this tournament system could, which is what they call it.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:20:04):**  So when they they harvest all the barns at the same time, and that everyone, each growers  graded against each other.  So some are above average, some are below average.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:20:14):**  And depending on where you rank, you actually will make a little bit more or make a little  bit less money, not 100% sure how it works, but you are being graded and compared and  competitive, you know, incentivized against your compatriots here.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:20:31):**  And that's, you know, that sort of, they need every penny they get.  So they're, they're extremely motivated to do these sort of things.  So if you make the goal different, and they get paid an extra penny a pound to do, I don't  
**[0:20:45-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:20:45):**  know, I don't know what the goal would be.  But that whole tournament system is good, could be used for good instead of evil.  You just but there's no there's no one driving that there's no incentive for that right now.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:21:00):**  You hit on on something about, you know, cheap protein and cheap food.  And I've been thinking, thinking a lot the last month about the economics of food production  and labor versus inflation and land acquisition costs and, you know, other input costs.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:21:20):**  It's really difficult to kind of square agricultural production in a large part of the country  because of the high land costs and input costs.  Oh, man, wow, where were the what the hell was I going with that?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:21:36):**  And they're, they're only getting worse.  And I said it on just ads podcast the other day.  I can raise the question, have we reached peak Earl butts?  
**[0:21:50-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:21:50):**  Like have we reached the peak of get bigger, get out where there's, there's very little  room to grow bigger anymore and take on more debt that it's time for some of these operations  to start maybe shedding off pieces to and give a younger operator an opportunity to  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:22:09):**  start up.  You know,  I would certainly like to think so.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:22:15):**  But that does not at all seem to be the trends for all the all the big operations I see around  here.  So down in the valley from us, that are part of Sacramento Valley, the actual fertile part  
**[0:22:29-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:22:29):**  of the Sacramento Valley is just going into tree crops left and right.  And that they're only getting bigger, there's not more mom and pop starting up, what's happening  is the mom and pop started up 20 years ago, and they're 10 to 20 acres of walnuts aren't  
**[0:22:45-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:22:45):**  big enough.  And so they sell out to someone else who has you know, 5000 acres.  And it's just happens all the time, you know, you drive down the road and come down the  
**[0:22:55-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:22:55):**  road again a year later, like, Oh, look, it's now owned by crane.  Or now it's owned by whoever.  And it's just, it all to me, it feels like the consolidation is still happening.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:23:05):**  And that it feels like that what's happening is that if you are an innovative, driven,  young agricultural person, that if you want to operate at any scale, you got to work for  these big guys, and they'll give you a production unit, or something like that.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:23:19):**  And within the umbrella, you can innovate.  I'm not saying that that's the good way.  But that's what that's the way it feels like it's happening right now.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:23:29):**  And I can see that.  What's more valuable, the walnut crop or the long term water rights that are guaranteed  by having a tree that takes 30 years to grow?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:23:43):**  The  well, in California, your water rights are probably more valuable, but you get those  whether or not you have something in the ground.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:23:54):**  So you're, and this is actually what my wife does somewhat professionally.  She is a water engineer.  She knows all the water rights stuff.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:24:02):**  It's way, we are well outside of all of that sort of California Central Valley project  stuff.  So I don't deal with any of the irrigation districts or anything like that.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:24:12):**  I watch it from a distance and go like, Oh, man, that's crazy.  We have different water rights for two hours a day, every week for a year, and nobody would  still understand it.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:24:23):**  That's probably true.  So so yeah, so the  it is silly to be putting in so many permanent crops in California with the way the water  
**[0:24:35-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:24:35):**  rights are structured and with the way the water's falling out of the sky, that when  you get down south of the delta down into the Central Valley, San Joaquin Valley that  I don't quite see how that's all going to play out in the long run.  
**[0:24:48-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:24:48):**  I mean, they're already having to lay off thousands and thousands of acres have gone  fallow and they're trying to just limp these poor trees along and it's then there.  Well, then there's all this, you know, California is just starting to regulate groundwater usage.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:25:05):**  So somewhere down south, they're talking about subsidence where the ground is literally collapsed  feet four or five, six feet.  And that's basically all of your air pockets when that were full of water that became air  
**[0:25:20-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:25:20):**  collapsed and you now can never restore water back into that aquifer again, because it's  gone.  It's solid now there's no so it's all a little.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:25:31):**  It's a little hairy, really.  Yeah.  And then we have the whole urban versus rural argument about, you know, who deserves the  
**[0:25:39-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:25:39):**  water so rural people are pissed at urban people and urban people are pissed at rural  people and it's like, well, we need to grow food people you got to admit that.  Hey, city people need to, you know, take showers.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:25:54):**  I don't know what the answer is there but it is, you can see the strain happening that  the California water system, from my very inexpert standpoint is starting to show the  strain, because this was all set up back when we actually had more water and if you look  
**[0:26:10-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:26:10):**  at these really long range climate stuff.  As long as Europeans have been in California, we've actually been here in a wet period,  and that we are coming out of this wet period into a more historically average dry period.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:26:25):**  And that's so all of these systems that we have in place are based on the assumption  of water at, you know, a higher level than we probably really should be expecting.  So yeah, over the next 3040 50 years, there can be some pretty cataclysmic stuff going  
**[0:26:40-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:26:40):**  on here in California, agriculture.  And you know, just for reference, you're in Northern California.  So it's kind of like a different, you know, water situation and irrigation scheme than  
**[0:26:54-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:26:54):**  the one that's like, kind of really fixed in the front of my mind right now, which is  what's happening in the lower Colorado with like me and like Powell.  And the 30,000 foot view of it is, of all the, I think it's, I think this number just  
**[0:27:11-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:27:11):**  applies to Colorado River Basin, but something like 80% of the water in the Colorado River  Basin goes for agriculture.  Okay, yeah, we got to eat, we got to eat, we got to grow food.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:27:25):**  But people are realizing that there's a large part of that, that goes to grow corn, goes  to grow alfalfa.  And like, there's a significant number of alfalfa acres that account for a lot of water  
**[0:27:40-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:27:40):**  usage, and that alfalfa and that land is owned by Saudi Arabian corporations.  And they load that alfalfa onto airplanes, and they fly it to Saudi Arabia to feed to  their racehorses.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:27:53):**  Like, you know, I'm complaining about $270 a ton alfalfa hay.  Like I can't imagine what the freight is on it to fly it from Arizona, New Mexico, Arizona  and Nevada to freaking Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:09):**  That's got to be absurd.  They never even look at the bill, man.  I know.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:15):**  It's like they just laugh when they're putting their own fuel into the tanks of the airplane,  I'm sure.  But I think about things like that.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:23):**  And I remember, I kind of remember, like, in 80s and 90s when I was a kid, and we grew  up about the same time.  They didn't allow foreign nationals, they didn't allow foreign companies to own farmland,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:38):**  like that wasn't a thing.  I don't think it was, maybe I'm wrong.  We touched on cheap food earlier.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:50):**  That's one of the functions of government.  That's one of the prime functions of government, like to ensure that the people can eat and  that food is plentiful and cheap to allow for growth.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:28:59):**  I mean, if we don't have cheap, plentiful food at the bottom, at the bedrock of the  economic pyramid, the whole thing's on a shaky house of cards.  So there's problems in agriculture.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:29:17):**  We talked about just a few minutes ago, feedlots and chicken barns and hog barns kind of representing  what I feel some of the worst of the industry and some of the worst animal husbandry practices  that we can even dream up.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:29:35):**  They don't want to know how the sausage is made.  They don't want to know how the bacon is made.  They just want it all to cost a dollar.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:29:43):**  I can remember not too many years ago, my wife went to the store and brought home like  a bag of chicken, like a two or three pound bag of chicken for $2, $3.  It was like a dollar a pound.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:29:59):**  And now we sit back and we think about that and we go, how many people are exploited for  that $1.99 a pound chicken?  How many people get exploited for that 99 cent cheeseburger?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:30:16):**  How much environmental destruction and how many externalized costs are behind that?  So a lot, all of them.  So let's wrap that back around to back to your chickens because that's where we were.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:30:29):**  We were talking about how you raise your chickens.  Right.  So, yeah, we're pasture raised.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:30:38):**  So that means we have no permanent buildings on the ranch except for the ones we live in,  humans.  So we do a, so I don't know, I don't quite know how to put it together, but that the  
**[0:30:58-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:30:58):**  conventional guys right now, their main directive is cheap, right?  Their whole thing is cheap production.  So we, as a pasture poultry person, we are not trying to get away from cheap production,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:31:11):**  right?  You know, we have to be as reasonably effective as possible.  But we just want to pair it with one other thing.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:31:18):**  And I think what I'm going to, I don't, this is a, I'm going to talk my way through this  theory.  So I don't know if I'm picking the right term to start off with, but something about like  
**[0:31:28-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:31:28):**  health, like animal health, land health, just health in general, you know, financial health  for the ranch.  And so as soon as you pair this additional concept to cheap, it changes your whole production  
**[0:31:43-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:31:43):**  system.  And so that, you know, this audience probably has a little better sense than some of the  other ones I talked to, you know, Joel Salatin wrote Pasture Poultry Prophets, Pasture Prophets,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:31:58):**  sometime in the 90s.  And he was, yeah, that's right.  You're gonna talk to him next week.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:05):**  So yeah, so anyways, he wrote the book.  I mean, and that really started the whole the whole movement, right?  And so that's where we started off with.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:12):**  We had our chicks and we moved them daily.  And just based on our environment, between our temperature and our geography of our pasture,  we ended up moving more toward a day range model, which means that we set up hoops for  
**[0:32:29-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:29):**  the life of the flock.  And the older they get, the farther they walk away from their hoops to get their fresh pasture  and they come back.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:37):**  You don't move the hoops like a chicken tractor?  Not daily.  Because we just we tried it, it's too hot, we couldn't build a hoop that would keep the  
**[0:32:48-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:48):**  birds from not baking.  And then we have creeks and hills and stuff like that.  So the day move just never worked for us.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:32:56):**  So we, we kind of developed off of the day range model, which kind of was talked about  by a guy named Andy Lee.  And this allows us to raise a lot more birds with a lot less, a lot less labor.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:33:12):**  So we're, we can do about 70,000 birds a year with two full time employees out there.  How many did you do that many this year?  No, we're gonna do about 50 this year.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:33:25):**  50?  Yeah.  Wow.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:33:28):**  Okay.  So that many birds, I gotta wonder where you get them from.  And what you do with them when they're ready to leave.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:33:40):**  So where do you want to start?  We'll start at the beginning.  So we actually buy our chicks.  
**[0:33:49-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:33:49):**  Well, just for discretion sake, I don't think it matters.  But we ended up buying them out of a, one of the bigger chicken industries here, companies  here in California.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:02):**  So we actually buy them kind of off the back dock.  So if they didn't come to us, they would have gone off to a conventional house.  Okay.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:09):**  And that's fair.  And I get why you don't want to like say, where are your sources?  That's totally cool.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:16):**  I'm just, and the angle that I would go with that is, if we have, like if these hatcheries  have big problems, it seems to me like there's just not very many commercial hatcheries around.  And if one or two of them has a problem, like that could really, really disrupt a large  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:39):**  part of the chicken industry.  Am I reading that right?  Is that you're feeling too?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:45):**  So you're not wrong.  It's hatcheries are reasonably plentiful, reasonably.  What really is limiting is egg supply.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:34:55):**  So there are only two or three or four large fertile egg suppliers that ship out eggs to  all of these hatches.  So, you know, if you're if you have a hatchery nearby, very likely that hatchery does not  
**[0:35:09-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:35:09):**  have its own breeding flock.  It just buys in fertile eggs, puts them in the incubator and hatches them out.  So I know that there's two or three in California that do that.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:35:18):**  They just buy in fertile eggs, hatch out and ship, which is totally fine.  But it's so you feel like you have a lot of hatchery options, which may or may not be  true in your area.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:35:29):**  But you probably don't have a lot of fertile egg options.  I can't remember the name of the company, but it's there's one company out of like Alabama  or Arkansas that ships, yeah, 60 70% of the fertile eggs in the US for all the Cornish  
**[0:35:46-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:35:46):**  Cross.  So you know, if you're if if you're really talking about trying to come up with a diversified,  solid, decentralized chicken genetic situation, anything that has to do with the Cornish Cross  
**[0:36:03-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:36:03):**  chicken, which is 99.8% of the country, you can't really do that in a backyard that the  amount of genetic line breeding and cross breeding and back reading that goes on.  It's insane.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:36:18):**  There's no way that a small scale person can do that.  You could what you could do is you could go to the one of the more heritage breed, which  would be a dual purpose like New Hampshire's or Rhode Island Reds or Delaware's or something  
**[0:36:30-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:36:30):**  like that.  But then all of a sudden you're leaving, you're leaving behind a ton of performance like weeks  and weeks and weeks on your grow out, which translates to dollars and dollars and dollars  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:36:41):**  per pound when you're going to retail.  So is it better?  Yeah, but no one's gonna pay for it.  
**[0:36:48-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:36:48):**  We've got a couple big white Cornish crosses in our little chicken flock.  We like 2720 29 yard chickens.  And they're all mixed up cross breed some have actually been raised from eggs, which  
**[0:37:03-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:37:03):**  I think is an important point because, you know, like if there's one hatchery in the  United States or one fertilized egg production place in the United States, that's like half  of the Cornish Cross chickens on the commercial market.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:37:18):**  Like the red flag people like that's, that's not great.  So we're just like I'm trying to do with my cattle trying to develop a breed that works  in this environment.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:37:31):**  I've really been encouraging her to try to, you know, keep back a rooster keep back the  good hens that are performing really well and that aren't always right up trying to  get food at the front of the line that you know, stay out and work.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:37:46):**  We've got some pretty decent chickens.  We've got we've got one that's red, red, orange, he's a cross breed, mutant weirdo, but he  makes really good.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:37:56):**  You know, he's a good rooster.  I think he's three and a half.  And the Cornish cross that we got as like, you know, as a chick in the spring is twice  
**[0:38:11-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:38:11):**  his size now.  Like but the Cornish cross, they're not as fast.  I mean, he'll go out.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:38:21):**  He'll go out farther than the other sometimes.  But he's big, fat, slow and dopey.  Like I'm just waiting to see a coyote come out of the brush and just snatch his ass and  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:38:29):**  take him away.  But hasn't happened yet.  Hopefully we'll get to put him in the freezer in a week or two.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:38:36):**  So that leads me to the other question.  If you got 50,000 birds, I hope you're not doing all those in the kitchen.  If you are, it probably takes more than a day.  
**[0:38:50-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:38:50):**  At that scale, so there is something under 20,000 birds.  The USDA kicks out an inspection down to the state level.  Each state has their own levels of inspection.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:39:02):**  So you can process depending on your state regulations up to 20,000 birds on farm.  But at over 20,000 birds, you have to be USDA no matter what.  So we've been going to a USDA plant for the past 12, 10 years, something like that.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:39:22):**  And yeah, we're we're knock on wood, we're kind of professional at it.  Now, that mostly what you see guys doing is they'll have plastic crates, you know, with  the top open, you put your birds inside of it.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:39:35):**  I don't know if you've seen those you see them pheasants, pheasant guys will use these  fairly often to carry pheasants around.  We've upgraded to what they call coupes or modules depending on your part of the country.  
**[0:39:48-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:39:48):**  And it's a four foot wide eight or four foot wide eight foot long by five foot tall metal cage that has 10 doors on it.  Each one of those doors holds 30 bird 25 to 30 birds depending on weight and age.  We've got a 6000 pounds four wheel drive forklift, and we load that thing up and then we stack  
**[0:40:12-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:40:12):**  it on a semi trailer and we load up about 3000 birds at a time.  And on our semi trailer and ship on all ship them on off down the road.  That's like 20, 20 some truckloads of chickens.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:40:26):**  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  That's a lot of chickens.  That's a lot of biomass.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:40:33):**  It is well, I mean, chicken.  So I can't I couldn't do the math quick enough.  But you know, your average our harvest weight is about six and a half pounds live weight  
**[0:40:43-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:40:43):**  when we harvest these birds.  So 20 50,000 so that's 300,000 pounds of chicken live weight.  So that's say a grass fed steers to make the math easy 1000 pounds.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:40:55):**  So that's like a 300 steer a year grass fed beef operation, which is not small, but it's  not huge either.  So when I say 50,000 chickens, people like Oh my god, and they fall out of their chair.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:41:08):**  But when you kind of convert it over into cow numbers, you're like, yeah, it's it's  decent, but it's not like a huge operation.  If people think 50,000 chicken 50,000 chickens is a lot.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:41:21):**  I mean, it's compared to 29 50,000 is a lot, but compared to what Tyson what Tyson's already  done this morning, and we're Monday, like it's noon on Monday.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:41:35):**  No, Tyson did 50,000 probably in the first half hour this morning.  Probably more more.  Yeah, 50,000.  
**[0:41:43-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:41:43):**  So a conventional barn depending on the size holds 20 20,000 30,000 birds, most conventional  guys run one to two barns at least so basically, and then they'll turn those barns over four  times a year, I think.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:01):**  So you know, basically, we are one half of one guy's barn in one turn.  I mean, it's really we're nothing.  We're nothing.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:11):**  So it sounds like a lot and it is a lot.  There are a lot of benefits from having this much, you know, because you import lots of  fertility in the form of chicken feed that you turn into chicken manure, like there's  
**[0:42:21-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:21):**  all sorts of fun fertility stuff that's going on.  There are so we're doing lots of cool stuff with this chicken.  But so on, it's just kind of it's what scale you rank it on, like on the impact for having  
**[0:42:38-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:38):**  it on our land, yeah, it's pretty awesome, pretty big.  Are you ranking us on the production of like other pasture producers?  Yeah, we're on the bigger side.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:47):**  Are you ranking us on any sort of scale of conventional operations?  We're nothing.  So our processor that we go to, they process 50,000 birds a week, and they are a pretty  
**[0:42:59-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:42:59):**  small scale operation where they do most things by hand.  So that means that for a processing plant, kind of the minimum viable size of a processing  plant, we are less than one week's worth of work for them.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:43:13):**  So another another fun way of spinning that, which is where someone always goes to if you're  in the direct marketing world is like, well, processing, right, processing is a bottleneck,  how do you get them all killed?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:43:25):**  How do you get them turned into saleable product?  Well, in California, we have two processing facilities, there's the one we go to, and  there's one other one, there's a third, but it doesn't really work out.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:43:39):**  And so that there is a capacity there.  Like we, when I when I was doing 70,000 birds a year, I basically maxed out our current  processor that they didn't have room for little people, because I was bringing in a whole  
**[0:43:51-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:43:51):**  bunch of stuff for a whole bunch of birds for our client.  You're bringing in truckload every other week.  Truckload every other week.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:00):**  At that point, it was gonna be a truckload a week that was gonna be well, yeah, 3000  birds a week, something like that.  We so anyways, you want to get into owning your own processing plant.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:12):**  Everyone always says this, you know, on farm kills a way to go.  And I'm not going to debate the whole like logistics of it or the economic realities  of it.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:21):**  But just to know that to keep the doors open, you need to basically process people are gonna  argue with this three to 5000 birds a day.  So you need to be able to produce and sell 15,000 birds a week kind of minimum to open  
**[0:44:38-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:38):**  your own processing facility.  So well, let's call it 20,000 times 50 weeks.  So you're looking at what a million birds a year to open your own processing plant.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:48):**  Yeah, just to keep the lights on.  Right.  And we're doing 50,000 birds.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:44:52):**  So there's another skill to drop this all on to that, you know, if you're you're really  nothing unless you're doing a million birds a year.  Kind of like you're not a whole lot in the cattle business until you're doing 1000, 15,  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:07):**  2000 head.  Right.  I mean, well, even at that scale.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:14):**  So I think weekly cattle harvest is something like 640 to 660,000 head.  So yeah, I guess until you're, until you have your own feedlot of about 100,000, you're  kind of a small player in the beef industry.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:31):**  And, you know, puts it in perspective guy with, you know, 120 cows or go 50 cows.  You know, we're kind of a speck of dust and it puts things in perspective.  Right.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:41):**  I mean, we're super important dust.  I mean, not to like denigrate where we're at.  I mean, we were very critical to the whole system, but it does kind of and this also  
**[0:45:51-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:51):**  circles back a little bit to the economic incentives of cheap.  You only get cheap by getting big.  Right.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:45:58):**  So that's kind of why everything's gotten big.  So that's, you know, to some degree, that's how, yeah, that's just how it's worked out.  So we don't, we don't really want to get to necessarily be a million birds a year.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:46:12):**  That sounds like way too much work.  But you know, 50, 70,000 birds a year direct to consumer, making people happy, sharing  the good word about all the fun stuff we do.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:46:23):**  That's okay.  That'll make a pretty solid living for me and my family.  So 50,000 a year, that's, you know, that's your contract growing situation.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:46:32):**  Let's, let's circle back to your direct marketing channel and direct to consumers.  I get the impression you're trying to spin that back up and build that back up.  Give me an idea of how many birds a year you think you can move through that pipeline and  
**[0:46:46-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:46:46):**  what your customer base is like.  I think, well, our last contract grower was, our contract grower, we were growing on contract  was selling about a thousand birds a week through their online site.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:47:08):**  So that's, that's my entire market research there.  I was raising the birds.  I knew that they were selling about a thousand of them a week through online.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:47:18):**  So boom, that's kind of to some degree why I picked the number I want to do 50,000 birds  a year direct marketing because I know someone who was doing it with my birds from right  here in California sold to mostly California consumers.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:47:32):**  So that's, and the market's only grown.  I mean, the more you talk to people, I mean, the only sticking point to pasture poultry  is that it's so expensive because people don't expect chicken to be expensive.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:47:46):**  Chicken is cheap, whether or not that's true.  It's not.  That's what people expect.  
**[0:47:51-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:47:51):**  So when you come to them with a chicken that is multiple times more expensive than what  they are expecting, they're like, this is amazing, but I'm going to go get my Costco  rotisserie for $3 and call it good.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:48:03):**  Because they don't, they don't realize the externalized cost of cheap food.  You know, like we talked about the environmental cost, the social cost, the, you know, the  cost to the neighbors and all done in corporate profit, which, you know, circles back to the  
**[0:48:24-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:48:24):**  cheap food argument.  And what's a, well, we'll run away from that can of worms, but I just, I lately have  been thinking that there's just no system of economics that adequately addresses the  
**[0:48:44-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:48:44):**  labor and energy requirements of food production over the long term.  Well, you might be right.  There's probably a reason why there has not been a long term sustainable civilization  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:48:57):**  yet.  All right.  You got cows?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:02):**  We do.  Yep.  You said you do grass fed cows.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:06):**  Yep.  So what's that like?  They're basically a hobby at this point.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:13):**  I mean, we grew up as I grew up doing cow calf.  You know, that's kind of my spirit animal.  You know, people are always like, well, you must eat a lot of chicken.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:24):**  I'm like, I do.  But if you give me a choice, I'm going with a steak.  It's like, or, wow, that many chickens, you must really love them.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:33):**  I'm like, well, cows are more interesting.  They got personality.  Luckily, the guys who take care of the chickens think I'm complete nuts and they love our  
**[0:49:41-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:41):**  chickens and they're always telling me the goofy stories that the chickens do because  you need to have that sort of relationship with your animals.  So they're better chicken people than I am apparently.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:49:55):**  So yeah, no, the cows are good.  I mean, so the ranches were about 4,000 acres, which in this neck of the woods is about how  half size we should, you know, to be a true cow calf operation, we probably need about  
**[0:50:08-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:50:08):**  10,000 acres of this sort of country.  So we're always part of the reason why we're doing all these weird things is because we've  always been looking at how can we value add to the production here that for whatever philosophical  
**[0:50:23-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:50:23):**  ethical reason, we never went to rent more land.  We never because around here, a lot of people were in the valley.  This is what they would call winter grazing ground and then they shipped their cattle  
**[0:50:33-0:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:50:33):**  up into the mountains up into the Klamath Basin or up into the Sierras for summer grazing.  We just never pursued that for whatever reason.  It just wasn't something we chose to do.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:50:44):**  So it's always been what can we produce here on these 4,000 acres and what and when I especially  when I came back from college like, Oh, well, now how do we make a ranch that can barely  support one family support two.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:50:58):**  And that's where all this value added direct marketing stuff has been coming along.  And that's one of the nice things about chickens is that you're not actually limited to your  land base that you can actually buy in your outside input, right, you're buying in the  
**[0:51:12-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:51:12):**  grain, you can grow the chicken, so you're not really limited to your fertility.  So that's one of the things that has been really great about chickens for us is that  we've been able to grow more more chickens here than probably you would do then we can  
**[0:51:26-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:51:26):**  ever grow beef anyways.  Right.  So you've been able to I'm not saying that very coherently, but we can grow more chickens  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:51:34):**  and maybe we can ever grow beef.  Yeah, something like that.  I think that makes sense.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:51:40):**  I think, well, chickens are a more efficient converter to begin with.  Like, chickens are kind of right up at the top of the efficiency scale for conversion  of protein to pounds of meat.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:51:53):**  Not far below them is going to be, you know, hogs and then sheep and goats and then kind  of towards the other end is going to be cattle.  And you know, since they are such efficient converters, I start to the place that I that  
**[0:52:09-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:52:09):**  I kind of always end up in my mind is, is inputs, always got inputs.  And man, last guy talked to that was kind of in your neck of the woods.  I think he's on the opposite side, like two hours the opposite way of Sacramento from  
**[0:52:27-0:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:52:27):**  you.  He told me that 70 something percent of the corn that they need in California for animal  production has to come over the mountains.  
**[0:52:42-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:52:42):**  And 50,000 chickens needs a lot of feed.  But compared to I don't know, Harris Ranch, or just one feedlot, you use almost nothing.  Are you concerned about the price and availability of grain for your chickens in the near future?  
**[0:53:02-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:53:02):**  Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it is our hugest input cost.  I mean, for instance, so we are certified organic.  We are also a no corn, no soy operation.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:53:17):**  So our feed cost has gone, we were at Oh, plus or minus $600 a ton about, probably 16  months ago now.  And right now we're at about $1,000 a ton.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:53:31):**  So that that's that shows up.  That's that's a real number that shows up on the price I have to charge customers part  of the reason why our wholesale hasn't been growing as fast as it could is because we're  
**[0:53:42-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:53:42):**  probably Oh, a buck buck 50 more expensive because of our feed price.  So yeah, it's certainly something I am worried about.  And it is really the true, the true Achilles heel to any sort of poultry operation post  
**[0:53:59-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:53:59):**  pastured or not is that those are outside commodity prices.  They're influenced by world events, you know, the whole triomea thing Ukraine.  So you know, if you look at if you and I don't have the numbers to prove it, but logically  
**[0:54:20-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:54:20):**  follow me down this rabbit trail here.  If we internalize all those externalized chicken feed costs.  So if we actually pay corn what it costs to grow it in the Midwest, if the soy cost is  
**[0:54:33-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:54:33):**  actually what it costs, if somehow we we pay the chicken grower, the contract guy for Tyson  or Purdue or whoever a real living wage, we somehow account for the dead zone in Mexico.  I don't know how you do all this stuff, but you count for all that.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:54:50):**  You're soil erosion, total and soil erosion, right?  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:54:56):**  And all the other ones I'm not even thinking of.  Now you put all that into the feed into the chicken cost, you really think chickens and  it costs $3 a pound or $2 a pound, there's no way.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:55:07):**  I don't know what it's gonna be, but it's gonna be way up there.  Now you take that same sort of idea and you apply it to grass fed beef where you've got  grass, you got sun and you got cow the other some more but I mean, that's pretty much it  
**[0:55:22-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:55:22):**  more or less.  So chicken actually is not a cheap protein.  It's not a chicken should not be cheap.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:55:31):**  The only reason it's cheap is because of the way the Farm Bill is set up the way the economic  system has been set up.  And that really, chicken, I don't know why I can't remember why I went down this rabbit  
**[0:55:45-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:55:45):**  hole chicken should not be cheap.  So one of the really should figure out which president said this his one of his presidential  slogans was a chicken in every pot.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:55:57):**  As in like, hey, prosperity, if you have a chicken in your pot, everyone is happy, healthy  and wealthy.  Well, us modern people are like, well, chicken in a pot, big whoop.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:56:06):**  Well, the thing was back when that slogan came to into being that not everyone had access  to chicken, chicken was a special thing.  That chicken Sunday roast dinner was a big deal.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:56:18):**  That's why you had chicken on Sunday because that was the crown jewel of the week of your  dinners or your suppers depending on your part of the country, right.  And so when he was problem when the president was promising a chicken in every pot, that  
**[0:56:32-0:56:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:56:32):**  was to some degree, the beginning of this whole cheap chicken idea that they took a  very expensive, loved and unexpected and expensive and loved protein and made it accessible to  the masses.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:56:45):**  And everyone's like, Oh, I can now eat like, you know, this is like getting caviar for  free or whatever, you know, it's that it was a cheap way.  Or not a cheap way.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:56:54):**  It was a way of making people love the politicians and getting them reelected.  So that's a little bit of a political conspiracy theory there.  But to some degree, that is why chicken is cheap is because 50 years ago, some president  
**[0:57:08-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:57:08):**  wanted to be elected again, and congressman and blada, blada, blada, blada.  So I'm not really a political conspiracist.  But there's definitely some machinations going on behind the curtains to keep chicken at  
**[0:57:21-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:57:21):**  the price it is now because it's, it shouldn't be this cheap.  I would definitely agree that it shouldn't be anywhere near as cheap as it is in a grocery  store.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:57:31):**  And I think our beef price has to come up too.  And that was something I think you mentioned earlier was, where did I make that note?  valuing the beef correctly, I believe is what you said.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:57:44):**  And you know, we're kind of talking about it with chicken about, you know, these externalized  costs that if we, you know, all this accounting was done properly, what would the food really  cost?  
**[0:57:55-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:57:55):**  No one knows.  But I do think that it's kind of clear that we're not valuing our beef correctly.  And the same is true for you in Northern California is this for me here in the plains.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:58:11):**  It's kind of difficult to sell grass fed beef at the premium we think that we should be  charging when the consumer's mind still has $1.99 ground beef in it from two years ago.  And they don't understand that that same ground beef they paid 99 cents a pound for two years  
**[0:58:28-0:58:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:58:28):**  ago is now $4.99 a pound in the exact same meat case in the exact same package.  And they're not getting that.  So what do you think there's going to be? Do you think that's going to change in the  
**[0:58:45-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:58:45):**  near future that we're going to start maybe chipping away at some of that customer perception  that our premium isn't worth the price?  Oh, I don't know about that.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:59:03):**  I mean, I guess I'm going to do a politician and not answer your question at all. I would  say I acknowledge your question. I have no idea what the answer is. Let me tell you what  I want to tell you. Okay, so what I'm going to say is that that's one of the reasons why  
**[0:59:21-0:59:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:59:21):**  I am aware, you know, pushing into this direct to consumer is that to just be able to say,  Hey, people, this is it. This is who we are. This is what we do. These are the costs. This  is that this is how much it costs for us to grow this meat for you. And that certainly  
**[0:59:40-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=0:59:40):**  not to take it or leave it. But believe it or not that this this is the thing. And that's  the whole industry standard of mass customer perception versus reality and, and how to  change that. And then you have all the various third party things that wash through there  
**[1:00:03-1:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:00:03):**  of like, Oh, we're country of origin labeling, although I think only us producers care about  that versus like, you know, natural versus like free range, you know, versus, you know,  it's so big and crazy and convoluted that I try and bring it back down to a one on one  
**[1:00:22-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:00:22):**  level, like how do I tell you, my consumer what I am doing and why it matters and that  if you agree with me and you buy my meat, this is awesome. We have a great relationship  going. If you think I'm great, but can't afford it, that's still good. I at least have opened  
**[1:00:39-1:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:00:39):**  your mind to the reality that production is way prices and costs of production are so  out of sync, that at some point, something's going to crumble. I mean, I'm surprised it  didn't crumble any harder than it did over COVID. But eventually these chickens are going  
**[1:00:57-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:00:57):**  to have to come home to roost. So not only did I do a politician answer, I don't even  think I answered my own question.  It's okay. I probably do that a lot and I never get called out for it. Chickens coming  
**[1:01:11-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:01:11):**  home to roost, I'd like that turn of phrase. So how concerned about greenwashing are you  of labels? Because you did say that you raise organic, non-GMO, no hormones, no antibiotics.  I'm asking that from the perspective because the other side, the production side, the animal  
**[1:01:43-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:01:43):**  science side that's relying on science and needles, they'll say, well, if it's 30 days  post injection, there's no antibiotics in it because it all processes out of the body.  Well, does antibiotic free mean there shouldn't be any in the meat or does it mean there's  
**[1:01:59-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:01:59):**  never been any in the meat? What do these things mean?  Yeah, greenwashing. That's a quagmire, man. You're throwing me into the deep end here.  So my personal answer is that this is why I try and talk to consumers and be like, I'm  
**[1:02:18-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:02:18):**  not greenwashing. I'm telling you like, this is how it is. This is how we do it. For us,  antibiotic free means I don't have any on the ranch. I couldn't give it to them if I  wanted to. When you start going into grocery stores where you kind of are a hands off situation  
**[1:02:36-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:02:36):**  that greenwashing is obviously a problem. I mean, the whole term natural, I mean, what's  the actual definition of natural? Minimally processed or something, minimally something,  minimal ingredients, whatever. I mean, clearly that is absolutely meaningless, but they actually  
**[1:02:52-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:02:52):**  get it, they still get a premium for it. But on the other hand, that means they took a  step better, right? So to some degree, I am a big fan of making many small steps in the  right direction being directionally correct. So, you know, hey, this is my favorite example.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:03:13):**  You know, organics, we're getting a lot of organic stuff from China. Is that really organic?  Probably not. But is that pseudo organic China or organic stuff from China? Is that better  than the conventional stuff from China? Probably, right.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:03:31):**  It doesn't come out of the same form and they just paid off an inspector to look the other  way while they stamped organic on. Well, don't don't ruin my metaphor here, man. Okay, the  idea is that the idea is that just if we can move in the right direction, that things get  
**[1:03:47-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:03:47):**  better. And that, like I said, that the chicken industry has reduced their antibiotic use  by some large percentage. That's all consumer driven. And that's because some consumer was  willing to pay five cents a pound more on a package that said antibiotic free or whatever  
**[1:04:02-1:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:04:02):**  the price was. And they have they are shifting a multi billion trillion dollar industry because  the consumers don't want or worried about superbugs. And so the greenwashing is definitely  there. You can see it happening. Even now pasture raised is starting to like it, you  
**[1:04:24-1:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:04:24):**  know, nibbled at by some of these bigger companies are trying to show up in the grocery store.  It's like, I just don't see how a nationwide brand can be truly pasture raised. But so  greenwashing is obviously an issue. But I think really, if you're seeing greenwashing,  
**[1:04:43-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:04:43):**  what that means is the industry is trying to get ahead of a consumer trend. And that  they, you know, they want to kill it, they want to make money by it, but they see that  the trend is happening. And so I you know, that's both kill it. And then I also see them  
**[1:04:58-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:04:58):**  by joining it, you know, they like General Mills bought epic bars a few years back, right?  General Mills sees the trend of I don't know what that trend is, you know, meat bars, organic  meat bars, high end regenerative meats, and they couldn't figure it out their own self.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:05:14):**  So they had to go buy someone bring it into their system.  They screwed it up.  Well I don't know that they did. Yeah, I mean,  
**[1:05:24-1:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:05:24):**  I opinion they screwed it up. I feel like the quality went down. I quit eating epic  bars and I went to went to different products.  Well, I never ate them in the first place. But just I guess my point being is that greenwashing  
**[1:05:40-1:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:05:40):**  is happening, but that these big companies are only greenwashing because they thrill  feel threatened. And that even if they have to greenwash the truth, they've at least had  to take a small step in the right way. So if as consumers, this is another thing I like  
**[1:05:56-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:05:56):**  to say a fair amount is that we choose our future every time we buy our food, right?  This is how people get connected to the ground. You live in the city, you don't think you're  connected to farming and agriculture, but you eat every single day. Right? So if you  
**[1:06:11-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:06:11):**  buy something, you are sending a very clear market signal that I value this. And that's  if you say, Hey, I bought a pasture raised chicken, you're saying I value this. Well,  Purdue is going to pay attention to that and try and get ahead of that curve and whether  
**[1:06:28-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:06:28):**  or not it's going to be 100% a true blue pasture raised bird. Time will tell but that it's  more of a pasture raised bird than if they didn't see that market signal. So I'm not  saying it's perfect. I just like the trending in the general direction drive consumer knowledge.  
**[1:06:49-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:06:49):**  Hey, pay attention to this vote with your dollars and these big guys will eventually  turn their covers and follow us where we need to be.  The thing that's going to worry me is when we come is when like USDA comes out with a  
**[1:07:03-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:07:03):**  definition of what a pastured bird is. Because you know, like, they'll eventually if they  do, they'll have to come out and say something like, well, a pasture bird means that it's  never in confinement for more than this many hours a day. It's not, you know, not on a  
**[1:07:18-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:07:18):**  roof for this more than this many hours a day, that it's got a minimum of the whole  pasture area is x square feet times y birds. And you know, agriculture is very vast and  varied. And out here in the Great Plains, my context, my soil, my forage production  
**[1:07:43-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:07:43):**  is on a totally different cycle than you are. You can even go 40 miles in any direction  from this ranch and that production system would change like the carrying capacity to  land would change how many cows, how many chickens, how many sheep, how many goats,  
**[1:07:59-1:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:07:59):**  you know, that balance, that ratio would change. And the danger that we have when we when organizations  start making these top down rules that are supposed to apply to everybody from Maine  to Southern California, from Washington to Florida. It doesn't take into account, you  
**[1:08:16-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:08:16):**  know, the extreme variation there is in productivity and potential of the land. And even if we  break that down to, you know, oh, well, that's why we have EPA regions. That's why we have  resource concern areas. And it gets down to I just feel like that the infinite complexity  
**[1:08:36-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:08:36):**  of trying to manage on the land for the health of land can't be managed with top down decisions  without making significant sacrifices for the health. Does that make any sense?  Oh, yeah. No, I agree. I you're right. One one size does not fit all. And I don't have  
**[1:08:54-1:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:08:54):**  an answer to it. And I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna say, Hey, look, to my consumers, this  is my answer.  No, you have the answer. And the answer is connecting with the consumers and being transparent  
**[1:09:05-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:09:05):**  showing them what their what their numbers are. So like, the next question I want to  know is 50,000 birds a year direct to consumer. How many consumers is that, that roughly you  figured you're going to need to connect with?  
**[1:09:24-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:09:24):**  My, I'm saying 1000 families that my goal is to provide the protein for 1000 families  in the Bay Area. Okay, that's kind of our our mission statement, customer demographic,  whatchamacallit.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:09:38):**  And that's, do you figure that 50,000 chickens, I mean, 1000 family. 50 chickens a family.  I mean, yeah, chicken a week, chicken a week. And you know, when you break down the pounds,  that probably works out about right to average consumption.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:09:56):**  Yep. I mean, it depends on the family or, you know, a growing family or a pair, you  know, a bunch of retirees, the adi adi adi. But, you know, 1000 I mean, we can we can  grow enough, enough chicken for 1000 families. And then, you know, I want to get back into  
**[1:10:15-1:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:10:15):**  our small ruminant production, that this is the meat case you see in your store when you  go to town is going to look pretty much exactly like the meat case you I see here in California.  But when we open the doors, push our cart out, like you're going to have flat planes,  
**[1:10:35-1:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:10:35):**  I'm imagining I don't know, I'm going to push out I mean, like, Oh, I've got, you know,  different have hills around here. I've got tree crops, you know, we're different. So  it doesn't make sense that your meat case is the same as my meat case. And that it more  
**[1:10:50-1:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:10:50):**  specifically here in California, we're a Mediterranean climate. So we have cool, wet winters, hot,  dry summers. So if you look at our production curve, we spike in the spring and tail off  for the rest of the year. Now, if you look at a small ruminant production that spikes  
**[1:11:05-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:11:05):**  at pregnancy, and then lactation, and then you can dry them off for a couple months,  and then pregnancy starts all over again. So if you layer those two production cycles  on top of each other, Mediterranean climate is perfect for small ruminants that in California,  
**[1:11:24-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:11:24):**  in the 1940s ish, there were more sheep. Gotta get this right this time I said it wrong in  the last podcast and I got excoriated. There are in the 1940s there were more sheep in  all crap. Now, there are a lot of sheep in 1940. There were no there are no sheep now.  
**[1:11:47-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:11:47):**  And right now into into Hama County, my to Hama County, there are basically no sheep.  And so that the old timers knew how to grow grow animals here like well, this is great.  We can grow amazing goats and sheep here. Like we didn't really have buffalo here in  
**[1:12:02-1:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:12:02):**  California. There were some we had some big elk, but those also a grazier or a browser.  And so it's kind of unnatural to have so many beef here in California really should have  lots of goats and sheep. So the idea is that if we are truly trying to regenerate our landscape  
**[1:12:21-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:12:21):**  to pump as much health back into our landscape, the animal tools that we should be using our  goats and sheep, goats and sheep are a delicious even though people don't eat enough of it.  And that we have hills you can't see it out because of the glare but we are all sideways,  
**[1:12:37-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:12:37):**  we either flat or vertical. And we're all brush we you know, on our 4000 acres, we only  have about 1800 acres of good caloram couple thousand maybe the rest of that 4000 is you  know, Russia crap that's great for goats. And that's not actually counting on on all  
**[1:12:53-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:12:53):**  the way up and that's just a flat view that doesn't even account for all the hillsides.  Right? He started accounting for the hillsides, we probably have I don't know 6000 acres that  we can grow goats and sheep on. So the idea is that and the California we have are in  
**[1:13:08-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:13:08):**  a mega drought, and it's only going to get worse probably and we're in a you know, fire  zone, it's only going to get worse. Well, what are the goats and sheep eat the brush  what's burning right now brush what tastes really good to eat goats and sheep like it's  
**[1:13:20-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:13:20):**  there. There is something really kind of fun and energizing about the idea of putting together  the right balance of the right animals on the right landscape for the right reason.  And then presenting them to consumers and be like, Hey, people, by the choice of the  
**[1:13:36-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:13:36):**  food you make, you're going to create the environment that you want to live in, we're  going to eat down all this brush so we don't burn. When the brush turns to grass, we're  going to infiltrate more water, we're going to have more effective rainfall, we're going  
**[1:13:48-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:13:48):**  to have less drought, we're going to have less flooding, you know, and it's all because  of what you choose to eat. And so listen to me because I'm a wacky guy with a beard, but  buy our chicken, buy our goats, buy our sheep, buy some of our beef, and we'll save the world  
**[1:14:02-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:14:02):**  here in California.  You mentioned wildfires. Have you had any near you or affect you since you guys?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we actually, the back 1000 acres of the ranch burnt three years ago.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:14:20):**  So that was the August complex. It was at the time it was the largest wildfire in California's  history, which was three years ago. And I'm pretty sure every single year since then,  we've had the next largest wildfire. So unfortunately, we were winning with the best fire that burnt  
**[1:14:34-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:14:34):**  the ranch down. But now we're only like third or fourth place.  I can share that exact feeling 2016 March 22nd, 23rd, 24th. Well, March 22nd, through  the 26th, the Anderson Creek wildfire ripped up out of Oklahoma, came up into my ranch,  
**[1:14:51-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:14:51):**  went the next ranch north, took a hard right turn and went almost 20 miles to the east.  And when it burned, it was the biggest one in Kansas history, like 340 some thousand  acres, pretty good size. And we thought, wow, you know, there's never, that's the biggest  
**[1:15:08-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:15:08):**  fire that we've had in Kansas from a single source. That was bad. Hopefully, we won't  see that again in our lifetimes. 2017 was like, hold my beer. We had a little fire called  the Starbuck Complex fire that was like 625,000 acres. And then in 2018, just south of me  
**[1:15:29-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:15:29):**  down in Oklahoma, they had some stuff down there that was just about downright biblical.  I mean, so for all the listeners, you know, everybody's going to have a different perspective  on wildfire, right? You know, from what you see on the news, what you see on the news  
**[1:15:46-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:15:46):**  is a lot of times fires in the west, you know, kind of out where you are, Tyler, you know,  Montana, Idaho, Colorado, you know, where you've got these huge coniferous trees and  big landscapes and lots of fire, lots of wind. The same stuff happens here on the Great Plains.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:16:01):**  It's just like our brush is smaller, our hills are smaller, but things are a lot more, things  can move a lot faster. I mean, when a fire can outrun you in the grass, and you're running  555 down the Blacktop Road, folks, this is a situation. You know, just like you guys  
**[1:16:22-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:16:22):**  have the eucalyptus trees and the big pines and the firs and whatnot that blow up and  explode, we have Eastern Red Cedar trees. And in some places, some pastures, they've  been allowed to get out of control. And there's, you know, 15, 20, 50% canopy cover these massive  
**[1:16:38-1:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:16:38):**  trees. Well, it takes a big wildfire event to get in there and light them up. But when  they do light up, you can see it on the satellite. NASA sees it on the satellite from the huge,  huge heat plume that gets released. Turns the sky black. It's just nasty. So where  
**[1:16:56-1:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:16:56):**  I'm going with this is, is after a fire, and it kind of almost doesn't matter the timing  of fire anymore, in my mind, okay. What matters is what you do after the fire to manage the  land after the fire when you choose to reintroduce grazing or browsing animals and whatever that  
**[1:17:18-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:17:18):**  looks like. Talk a little bit about your experience with fire, if you have any experience with  prescribed fire and how you managed recovery after the wildfire burnt that back 1000 acres.  Right. So we are actively actually pretty active with well, California Department of  
**[1:17:43-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:17:43):**  Forestry or something like that, Cal Fire, we work with them a fair amount, we do as  much as we can, prescribes burns in the winter. I think things are changing, but it actually  that you can't obviously do a control burn in the summer because it no control possible.  
**[1:18:01-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:18:01):**  So you can only do control burns in the winter. And you can only do a control burn when the  veggie the fuel load is dry, but the ground is wet. Well, those specific conditions actually  happen a fair amount. But it only happens in a weather condition where all that smoke  
**[1:18:17-1:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:18:17):**  settles into the valley and then goes down into the city. So the air quality control  board never lets these decent sized control burns happen because basically, it'll smoke  out the city. So that has actually been a huge issue that you know, any, any real firefighter  
**[1:18:36-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:18:36):**  I've ever met has always been kind of like a back pocket pyro and they want to burn man  they want to burn.  I just make sure I have this situation capture. It's like the people are starting to figure  
**[1:18:49-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:18:49):**  out we need to burn these forests because we haven't managed them correctly to manage  the fuel load. Yes, go prescribe burn. Cal Fire's like, yes, we need to do prescribed  burning. Yes, we're going to prescribe burning. The landowners are all like, yes, we see the  
**[1:19:02-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:19:02):**  benefits. We want to burn. The Air Resources Board is like, yes, we see the benefits, but  we're not going to let you do it because those old people with asthma down the valley might  not have a great day.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:19:14):**  Yeah, I don't know what their reasoning is. But yeah,  I totally get it. You know, like, if we're going to burn, I mean, fires, fires part of  my culture too. And further east in the Flint Hills where they have more of an issue because  
**[1:19:28-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:19:28):**  here when we burn in the Red Hills, we're so far away from population centers like,  you know, we can burn an awful lot not really risk of run any, you know, major smoke risk  over in Flint Hills in eastern Kansas. If they do it on the wrong day, they're either  
**[1:19:43-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:19:43):**  going to smoke out Wichita, Emporia, Topeka, Salina, Kansas City. It's one of them. Like  somebody's getting smoked out the first week of April when the Flint Hills burns. That's  just the way it is. And to some extent, maybe that represents the difference in culture  
**[1:20:00-1:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:20:00):**  because the Flint Hills has always been like that. Like they've had a burning culture for  decades. And even there, it's not enough. Like even in the Flint Hills, they're losing  the battle against invasive herbaceous vegetation and brush and whatever. But the people that  
**[1:20:21-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:20:21):**  are downwind of them have always been a little bit more accepting of the smoke. And there's  been, oh, in the last 15 years since I've been aware of it because my work with the  Kansas Prescribed Fire Council and smoke management plans with the EPA. Oh gosh, that was 2008,  
**[1:20:38-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:20:38):**  2009 and 2010. The EPA has been trying to work in Kansas to get them to similar problems  like you guys are having out there in California. Like they recognize we have a right to burn  and it's a critical thing to maintain certain kinds of pasture lands. It's a critical thing  
**[1:20:55-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:20:55):**  to prevent the spread of invasive brush and habitat loss. But at the same time, it's difficult  because they have to balance the needs of the many downstream. And if they, we're not  burning enough. I mean, it's clear, you know, even with all the policies, even with the  
**[1:21:21-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:21:21):**  all everything that we've made strides forward in the last couple of years about raising  awareness of prescribed burning. Even here in my area, with as much as we've done in  the last 10 years, it's not even 20% of what we actually needed to be doing. And we know  
**[1:21:37-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:21:37):**  that. But it's just so hard. You know, that's, that's another set of problems. And I imagine  you guys are dealing with an entirely different, different set of problems when it comes to  trying to get a prescribed burn off and finding just the right magic day with the right weather  
**[1:21:54-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:21:54):**  conditions and the right smoke management conditions to allow you to burn without affecting  anybody else negatively. But then maybe the other side of the coin is, do, have we failed  in, in reaching our consumers and letting them understand our challenges and the tools  
**[1:22:16-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:22:16):**  that we need, the tools and practices that we should be applying more?  Oh, I think the answer is absolutely yes. I mean, the only, the only education that  I know about, as far as fire management, fuel management is Smokey the Bear. I mean, I can't  
**[1:22:35-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:22:35):**  think of anyone else. Right? You know, like, there's this whole propaganda system with  the kid and the Smokey the Bear comes to the elementary school, or, you know, all that  sort of stuff. And so I don't, you know, I can't even think of anyone else who has a  
**[1:22:50-1:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:22:50):**  countervailing idea. You know, it's like, that's, it's almost Smokey the Bear is the  biggest problem than anything. So I don't know, I don't, there's, there's got to be  kind of some sort of not quite cultural, but some sort of like top down reeducation process.  
**[1:23:12-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:23:12):**  I think it was, it might've been something I saw come out of Oklahoma, or maybe it was  something I saw come out of Kansas, but it was from one of the forest service and it  was a redo of Smokey the Bear. And instead of, you know, only you can stop a fire, only  
**[1:23:28-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:23:28):**  you can start a prescribed fire. Nice. And we even talked about like trying to get that  on books and matches or get that on a lighter, but we didn't think that that forestry service  would be too happy about us using the likeness of Smokey the Bear, go start fires.  
**[1:23:42-1:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:23:42):**  That would be pretty funny.  It's responsible use of fire. And, you know, I imagine to some extent, Smokey Bear was  maybe was kind of necessary and maybe it did do a good job of saving the forest that now  
**[1:24:00-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:24:00):**  we've got to go fight the other way to protect, you know, bring back the fire and try to restore  the balance. Maybe it's just another example of a shortsighted government program with  the best of intentions.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:24:17):**  Oh, I think, I think that's absolutely the case of, you know, it seemed to have come  into existence for a reason. But it was a knee jerk reaction to a situation without  real long-term. Cause I mean, to go down another rabbit trail as humans were really terrible  
**[1:24:35-1:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:24:35):**  at long-term situations, right? We don't, we don't think in a hundred year, 200, 300,  400 year cycles, we're like, what happened yesterday? What's going to happen tomorrow?  And that's, that's kind of the problem with, with all these fuel management is that we  
**[1:24:53-1:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:24:53):**  just had a very short-sighted like let's at least in our area, it was like, let's take  care of the timber. We don't want the timber to burn down. So we can't have any wildfires  at all, you know, but no one really kind of started looking at, and I am not an expert  
**[1:25:08-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:25:08):**  by any means. So if there's any California fire expert listening to this, I'm sorry,  I'm going to get this all wrong, but there are, they talk about stems per acre, like  how many trees per acre you should have. And that you can have, you know, you could have  
**[1:25:22-1:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:25:22):**  a hundred one foot stems or one or 10, 10 foot stems or something like that. So if you're  talking about the same stem area, just how it's divided up. Well, those 10, 10 footers  or whatever the right number is like, they're going to be pretty actually fire resistant  
**[1:25:39-1:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:25:39):**  because their surface area to volume ratio does not lend itself to burn. But those little  tiny ones, you know, that's basically upright kindling. That's just asking to burn. And  the only way you can get the 10 tens of the hundred ones is by basically burning it. You  
**[1:25:57-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:25:57):**  gotta burn them when they're small, or graze them when they're small, or do something to  them when they're small, and then only 10 out of those hundred survive, that you don't  actually we have, you know, through our management, we have grown this fuel system. And that,  
**[1:26:14-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:26:14):**  so that's one thing. And then also, that the the cover you mentioned cover 50 60 70% cover  that right here where I'm sitting, we are I'm about 10 miles north of a very minor trail  that they used to haul trail sheep from the valley, back up into the mountains for the  
**[1:26:32-1:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:26:32):**  summer and then they would trail and back down the winter. And that it's called Elkhorn  Ridge, and that it used to have grass up there, it used to be a good summer pasture. Well,  I don't go up there very much now. But you go up now and it's just a whole bunch of man's  
**[1:26:48-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:26:48):**  need to brush and like, you know, digger pine litter or pine litter, you know, a foot deep,  you don't see slowly, certainly don't see grass. And it's all because of all these big  ass trees and brushes that have just grown over and shaded out the ground. Right. And  
**[1:27:04-1:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:27:04):**  so what the old timers used to do is that they would graze their way up in the spring,  the last guy down just drop his cigarette in a brush pile here, here, there, here, there,  and he burned his way back down the mountain. And then in the springtime, he'd go right  
**[1:27:16-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:27:16):**  back up and hit all those little burn spots because they're greening up fastest and earliest  and they would kind of put all the pressure on all the stuff growing back. And so that  was the burn cycle. It was no no big deal. And now so they were going through what we  
**[1:27:32-1:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:27:32):**  call a chaparral belt, which is it's mostly comprised of a plant called chemise or a grease  wood. And it's it burns like, with the name and that's, I would expect it to burn rather  well.  
**[1:27:47-1:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:27:47):**  Yeah, it's a fun fire. If you have any sort of pyro in you this stuff is a stuff because  it's all on hillsides, right? So if you get a pile going at the bottom, just the convection  just like, we'll take off a whole five acre hillside in like 30 minutes just amazing sounds  
**[1:28:04-1:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:28:04):**  like a V8 engine. You can hear it from a half a mile away. It's  When did you say your burn season starts?  Well, used to well with the the fire wildfire season or the control season.  
**[1:28:16-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:28:16):**  Let me go check plane tickets either way.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, we all burnt that, right? It's all done that the  big fire already got it. So you have to come back in like another 10 years. But it is a  
**[1:28:29-1:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:28:29):**  fun burn. Holy moly, you know, flames like 1520 feet in the air just like and then it  hits a digger pine. And those things just like the Roman torches like what odds. It's  both terrifying and mostly cool. There's like that is a fire.  
**[1:28:48-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:28:48):**  You can have Eastern Red Cedar trees in a small enough area hit it with a hot enough  fire and you can put fire a column of black smoke, solid black smoke really high and there'll  be fire 100-150 feet up in the air up in that right. Right. And you start your quarter mile  
**[1:29:08-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:29:08):**  away and you start feeling the heat coming through the windshield and you start backing  up like maybe it's time back up a little bit. Yep. Yeah, that's that's fun.  So anyways, that I don't even remember but that's kind of the idea to get back for us  
**[1:29:24-1:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:29:24):**  personally goch and sheep and using not so much control burn as much as we can but just  using their presence to stay on top of this brush. You're asking about reintroducing animals  and we don't have the goats and sheep right now. That's the problem in California that  
**[1:29:39-1:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:29:39):**  most of these wildfires are happening in areas that are steep cows. I'm 1000 pound count  1500 pound count. I'm lazy. I'm not walking up this, you know, 90 degree slope. Go with  some sheep are like, Yes, please let me do that for fun. But we don't have the animals  
**[1:29:55-1:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:29:55):**  to do it. So right now it's just kind of growing back on its own. Right? I don't have to worry  about it. I can't get the cows back in there even if I wanted to. So the only only animals  I'm going to have to control that regrowth or goats and sheep. I don't have a market  
**[1:30:10-1:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:30:10):**  for them. I could take them to the local auction yard. But I mean, why not just shoot myself  in the foot and save the trip to the auction yard? Right? I mean, I can do the same thing  a lot cheaper. So so that's that is kind of the from a whole bunch of different ways of  
**[1:30:27-1:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:30:27):**  why I'm excited about goats and sheep is because, you know, it's a market we can develop, it's  appropriate to the landscape, it'll help us reduce our fuel risk, it'll help California  reduce its fuel risk. And that the cultural legacy baggage of goats and sheep don't taste  
**[1:30:45-1:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:30:45):**  good is just wrong. It's just wrong. I'm sorry, but my grandfather, I we are now old enough  that we probably should be clarifying that our grandfathers had a really crappy time  in World War Two, eating mutton. And mutton Yeah, I wouldn't want to eat mutton very often  
**[1:31:01-1:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:31:01):**  either. But mutton is a world of difference from lamb. And we just don't do mutton anymore.  It's lamb. It's a whole different whole different thing. Get over it people. Your grandpa's  dead. I'm, I'm coming around on the lamb. Like goat. Ground up goat and chili. Yes,  
**[1:31:22-1:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:31:22):**  please. I'm here for it. I'm still I'm. We're still working on the whole lamb chop business  like sometimes the smells just if it smells like greasy lanolin. Right? Totally out. I'm  totally out. If it smells good, it smells like meat. I'm probably in but that's  
**[1:31:43-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:31:43):**  Have you have you noticed any difference? Are those hair sheep or those wool sheep?  Have you noticed or you know, the only near enough of it to be able to have any kind of  educated opinion on the taste difference between hair and not hair sheep, sir. So the the story  
**[1:31:58-1:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:31:58):**  that I always kind of tell and it's probably not totally scientifically accurate, but that  lanolin is produced by wool and lanolins the flavor so hairish or wool sheep tend to produce  more lanolin because they have more wool. And so that the hair sheep tend to be a much  
**[1:32:16-1:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:32:16):**  more mild flavor and you less often have that gamey lanolin flavor to it. So that's just  kind of why I was asking and also there's a a age finishing thing kind of like beef,  right? If you have a stream beef that you didn't finish right, right, they're going  
**[1:32:33-1:32:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:32:33):**  to tend to taste a little funkier because they don't have that nice fat cover. It's  the same thing on your lamb. So even if you you want them finished, you're like, oh, fat  has an have too much flavor, but you actually want them on an increasing that plan of nutrition  
**[1:32:47-1:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:32:47):**  with a good fat cover, and it actually drops the mutton the off flavor. So okay, random,  random stuff.  I mean, it makes sense that a hair sheep would have less lanolin, a lower lanolin level in  
**[1:33:03-1:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:33:03):**  the body or fewer of those glands than a wool type sheep would makes total sense. Total  sense. So I kind of want to circle back to your cows a little bit. Black on black, black  Angus?  
**[1:33:18-1:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:33:18):**  No, no. No, we're a complete smorgasbord. Basically, we're red. We're a red cow, red  Angus. The bulls we were buying from the Hatfield's back in the day were tarante based, okay,  which is the, well, I'm actually on a ranching podcast. And I'm going to say this, I'm going  
**[1:33:44-1:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:33:44):**  to be just totally wrong. And people are gonna throw rotten tomatoes at me. But the way I  would explain it, I would say that the tarante were the red Angus to France, which is totally  wrong. I understand it's wrong people don't send me hate mail, but it got it in the mind  
**[1:33:58-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:33:58):**  of other people.  Okay. I mean, and I can kind of see that like, it would be the parallel to what a what an  Aberdeen Angus is, but came from France.  
**[1:34:10-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:34:10):**  Right. Something like that. So we were, yeah, so we're kind of a red white face operation.  I think I personal feeling I read something in the stock and grass farmer, Alan nation  wrote it probably 15 years ago, or he said that, and it makes sense to me, do you like  
**[1:34:27-1:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:34:27):**  to wear a black t shirt in the middle of summer? No, take your infrared thermometer and he  hit the height of your black cow and you hit the height of your head cow and there's a  huge difference. And that California we're much more hot than we are cold. So a cow,  
**[1:34:44-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:34:44):**  you're better off to aim for a comfortable summer cow in a comfortable winter cow and  then much so I've always been a proponent of red. My dad thinks I'm nuts about this,  but I'm fine. I'm, I'm fine with being right. He can think I'm wrong. The other The other  
**[1:34:59-1:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:34:59):**  thing I remember reading is that the Angus have been bred black because of their region.  They didn't have very much sunlight. And so that the whole idea was to make them black  and they capture as much so like what little solar energy they had to keep them as warm  
**[1:35:14-1:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:35:14):**  as possible. And that's why they're black from that area. And that when you bring that  sort of genetics from a wet cold climate and bring it out to us here in California anywhere,  we are not cold, we are not wet or we are for about six weeks out of the year. It doesn't  
**[1:35:31-1:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:35:31):**  make sense. Like we should be much more looking, you know, you know, I don't know, Mediterranean  climates like, you know, some sort of Italian breed or I don't know what but that's, that's  my philosophy on breeding is to, you know, not black, even though everyone everyone else  
**[1:35:50-1:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:35:50):**  around here runs it. I think it's don't don't don't think like this is like some sort of  red cow country. Everyone else runs Angus around here. Everyone thinks I'm nuts, but  that's okay. I'm used to it.  
**[1:35:59-1:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:35:59):**  Hey, you see the picture behind me? I thought they're they're speckled spotted colored and  spotted all kinds of horns and look funny. But tell you what this calf crop, the last  two calf crops look just right. Beautiful uniform. It's like, there's six or eight of  
**[1:36:21-1:36:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:36:21):**  them that kind of run around as a group and that kind of go out underneath the wire and  go ahead and creep graze. And it's really funny. Went out this morning took a veil alfalfa.  They're all just carbon copies of each other. It's pretty deep.  
**[1:36:37-1:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:36:37):**  Right. So one and like they say, they're all red under the height anyways. So what does  it really matter?  Yeah, oh, that's a that was a can of worms. We were discussing on discord the other day,  
**[1:36:50-1:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:36:50):**  we're talking about the CAB program. And it's interesting that the guy that grades the carcasses  into the CAB program never gets to see what the height looked like. That's one of the  primary things that passes beef into the that's like that's the main criteria, right? It's  
**[1:37:07-1:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:37:07):**  got a black-headed, no white on the belly in front of the navel. Well, if the guy grading  it to pass into the program sees it after it's peeled, how does he know what color it  was?  
**[1:37:18-1:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:37:18):**  I don't know. He's been very talented.  So what what's I'll throw that out there. If you're out there in podcast land, and you  just heard me say that and you know the answer to that question, please write in, send it  
**[1:37:33-1:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:37:33):**  to me redhillsrancher at gmail.com or find me on social media. I'm really, really interested  to know the answer to that question.  How do you how do you get your cows through the winter? Like what's I'm assuming right  
**[1:37:49-1:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:37:49):**  now kind of like me, you're on the downside of your forage cycle and your grass is mostly  dormant, you're living on stockpile. So maybe walk me through a little bit of of your forage  chain through the not so great times a year.  
**[1:38:04-1:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:38:04):**  Yeah, so we we've reduced our cow herd by quite a bit from what we used to be. So basically  our own owned cows are basically hobby at this point, we've got about what do we got  1520 mother cows and we keep back steers and heifers kind of on a very unprofessional level.  
**[1:38:26-1:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:38:26):**  I mean, we're we just we should have sold them all when we kind of really went into  the chickens but you know, can't sell your cows man. You could not have cows right? Exactly.  That Yeah, it doesn't make sense to have them. It really doesn't make sense to have them  
**[1:38:42-1:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:38:42):**  but you can't not have cows. I would just so we actually are a winter grazing option  for we partner with a guy up in well, it doesn't really matter. He's up in the northeast corner  of the count of the state. And then he'll ship down a couple couple truckloads for the  
**[1:38:59-1:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:38:59):**  winter grazing season. So basically, we are just playing so our personal cows, we kind  of run them in the nooks and corners and the bottom lands and then we save all the rangeland  for his cows when he ships in. So basically, it's a it's just a brittle environment. So  
**[1:39:17-1:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:39:17):**  even though we actually have had decent fall rain, I'm actually we're green right now,  which is kind of fun. We just had a inch and a quarter inch and a half of rain over the  weekend with actually a little bit of runoff, which is actually exciting. That means reservoirs  
**[1:39:31-1:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:39:31):**  are being filled. So when he shows up for the first couple of months, it's basically  just metering out stockpiled, you know, we've got so what do we have 12 or 15 permanent  paddocks and then we'll split those up with some temporary fence depending on the season  
**[1:39:50-1:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:39:50):**  and what we've got where and then when our forest starts turning on in March, we'll just  start kind of rotating over into more of a fast growth fast move idea, then we'll probably  hit the ranch. So the five months that the cows are here, we'll probably hit each pasture  
**[1:40:08-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:40:08):**  maybe three times once in the stockpile season and maybe once or twice in the green season  depending.  So kind of like a what about an average of a three day graze in between moves? Yeah,  
**[1:40:20-1:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:40:20):**  yeah. Yeah. I mean, our our fields are wildly different in size because of the our geography  is all kind of funky. Sometimes I see you know, man, that's flat. Are you kidding me?  You can put a fence for everyone on that stuff.  
**[1:40:34-1:40:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:40:34):**  Yeah, looks to be deceiving. It's not as flat as it looks. It's the canyon that's okay.  So the canyon that's actually behind where the cows are over this ridge. Yeah. It runs  for it runs for about 6000 feet. Well, there's two places to get across it. Maybe. Yeah,  
**[1:40:57-1:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:40:57):**  there's no. But yeah, there's two places across it. One of them has a tree over it. Right?  It'd be a little bit dicey to get around. And, and that's all the way at the north end.  And all the way at the south end, I can get across that canyon, but anywhere in between  
**[1:41:12-1:41:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:41:12):**  that 6000 feet. You can't. And the sides of it, it's it's kind of a slot canyon that's  cut into the gypsum. So it's 15 foot down on one side, five foot across on the bottom,  and 25 feet up on the other side for quite a bit of its length. Wow. Yeah, it's, that's  
**[1:41:34-1:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:41:34):**  why it's, and it's in a 98. It's like a 98 acre paddock. It's it's that canyon. And that's  pretty much it.  Interesting. So you have to kind of like graze it, graze it in a circle then pretty much.  
**[1:41:48-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:41:48):**  Oh, I mean, they just kind of get turned in there. And if they need to go from one end  to the other, we'll just go move the mineral or the protein tubs and let them be in it  for a few days and cycle them right back out. Interesting. I've got several places like  
**[1:42:03-1:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:42:03):**  that, that, you know, I feel like the paddock is just too big. But I can sit here for hours  and hours and hours and design all the cool fences I want on Google Earth. Right. But  at the end of the day, somebody's got to go out and build that. And if I can't find a  
**[1:42:20-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:42:20):**  way, like if I have to build a significant, a lot too much of it on foot where, you know,  it can't be gotten around or I can't ride the fence, you know, that just that's like  asking for trouble later down the line. If we're going to build stuff that's going to  
**[1:42:38-1:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:42:38):**  last, we need to plan to maintain it. We need to plan for what's going to happen when it's  at end of life, you know, replacement of that. So, you know, then I get into the thing like,  all right, do I want to get the skid steer out or do I want to go rent a dozer so I can  
**[1:42:55-1:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:42:55):**  make some of this access? Well, as soon as I pull that root out of the ground, as soon  as we bear off that soil, it's eroding. Right. Like they shut down. The reason this ranch  exists and is still native range, what I like to call old growth grassland, which has never  
**[1:43:13-1:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:43:13):**  seen the plow of got, you know, over 90% of the ranch is old growth grassland, never seen  a plow. Well, it never saw a plow because it's not flat enough to pull a plow through.  Like they just couldn't figure out how to farm on more than about a five degree slope.  
**[1:43:28-1:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:43:28):**  I'm kind of grateful that because my whole ranch didn't get turned into a damn wheat  farm. So there's a lot of places that have just limited on how small I can get it by  not being able to get across because they don't, you know, they didn't farm it because  
**[1:43:50-1:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:43:50):**  it will erode. I mean, as soon as you take that soil cover off, take those roots out  of the ground, there's some soil types that I have not been able to successfully get stuff  to grow in five, six, seven years down the line. And there's some of it that, you know,  
**[1:44:07-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:44:07):**  there'll be a place 50 yards away from that. I'll go and, you know, tear up some dirt and  think, well, I, you know, whatever, don't care about this. If it ever grows again, I  never drive by here. Well, then it'll grow, you know, big bluestem and Indian grass, eight  
**[1:44:18-1:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:44:18):**  feet tall. And I'll wonder why it did it over there. But not really wanted it to that I  have to look at all the time. So I get really hesitant about going into some of these steep  areas with machinery to make access because I've done it. And I know what it looks like  
**[1:44:35-1:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:44:35):**  and what it's like to live with long term. So I don't have any answers. And I'll just  say that, you know, it is a challenge. It's a challenge to try to continue to figure out  how to find those efficiencies and how to, you know, maybe we can run a fence across  
**[1:44:54-1:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:44:54):**  here and saw this paddock in half. Okay, what's that get me? Well, that gets me another three  days on my grazing plan, or that's another, you know, five animal units that I can run  because I get three more grazing days because I got another move out of it. It just, it  
**[1:45:08-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:45:08):**  gets, it gets difficult to start finding those efficiencies when you're like, well, I could  build that fence there. But that's two days with the skid steer to go make that crossing.  And then every five years, I'm gonna have to go back and rebuild that. Right. Do that  
**[1:45:24-1:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:45:24):**  20 more times on the ranch. Like, there's, there's a point where it's just kind of almost  diminishing returns on building more fences, I think. Have you just kind of floated across  my radar screen these days, there's a couple of these virtual fencing companies where they  
**[1:45:41-1:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:45:41):**  basically are putting little shot collars on cows and GPS's and one of them is called  no fence and they found another one called vents, which is kind of funny. I don't know,  I'm all excited about it. I have no idea if it's actually going to work. I'm excited about  
**[1:45:56-1:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:45:56):**  the concept because one of the holdbacks to getting goats and sheep out here is that they're  going to go up these hillsides. I don't want to climb 1000 foot, you know, hillside to  go bring them down and yeah, dogs and all that sort of stuff. There's a ways around  
**[1:46:09-1:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:46:09):**  it. But, you know, if you could like program in with the collars, like, Hey, I want the  fence to be here and they can raise this band to the hillside and they can do that band  tomorrow and you know, then then you don't have to build fence you just you know, play  
**[1:46:24-1:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:46:24):**  with your computer on your app on your phone. It's like, ah, I like that idea.  So this is I mean, this is another one of those cans of worms. It's but it's a it's  a wonderful subject. So if technology can make my life easier, more efficient, make  
**[1:46:40-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:46:40):**  raising cattle more efficient, easier for me to do, I'm here for it. Okay. I get no  fences cool, Vince is cool. And then there's some tags that aren't necessarily a shot caller.  They're just more of a monitoring location tag. They're kind of like a Fitbit for cows,  
**[1:47:00-1:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:47:00):**  which is really cool too. And almost every one of them that's on the market. And so we  can talk about like a tag like serious or 701 X, which is just basically like the Fitbit  the monitoring tag. Or we can talk about a system like no fence or vents, which is an  
**[1:47:18-1:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:47:18):**  actual shot caller that actually that has an audio alert. So we developed a backup step,  we lost a lot of our animal husbandry and herding skills over the last hundred years.  Okay. They still know these things in Africa, like the Messiah tribe and the Negroni tribe,  
**[1:47:43-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:47:43):**  some of these tribes in Africa that you know, that they heard their cows around and they  they really, they have intrinsically understood the principles of holistic management. Alan  Savory shows up and, you know, shows them how to do it on the map. And they're like,  
**[1:47:55-1:48:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:47:55):**  yeah, we do this anyway. They still know how to herd their animals and operate them as  a herd and live in harmony with them. We culturally lost that when we started putting up barbed  wire fences. Okay. And I think a lot of the, you know, the rodeo Western culture that grew  
**[1:48:14-1:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:48:14):**  out of the 50s and 60s. I don't think that helped stockmanship a damn bit. So we invented  barbed wire. We, we fenced off the range to keep our cattle home because this is my place  and these are my cows and by God, my cows got to stay on my place. And then we invented  
**[1:48:35-1:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:48:35):**  poly wire and to some extent, poly wire and, and good hot fence chargers kind of replace  herding. And the way I make that make sense is like in an ultra high density grazing situation  where you're moving them every day, you're moving a piece of poly wire every day. And  
**[1:48:54-1:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:48:54):**  the analog to that is versus having two or three guys take turns working with the cattle  in a herd, keeping them in a certain spot to create herd impact in a specific spot.  We're just going to put a piece of poly wire around that, put our cows inside the poly  
**[1:49:08-1:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:49:08):**  wire until they do their thing. So in that analog, the poly wire is basically replacing  the physical skill, the physical labor of the herders. We can also talk a little bit  about the contrast of this all is what Bob Kenford likes to talk about when he talks  
**[1:49:24-1:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:49:24):**  about instinctive migrational grazing, which is some stockmanship techniques and movement  patterns that help reduce stress in the livestock and help encourage the cattle to adopt a more  natural grazing pattern without induced stress, induced handler stress, if that makes any  
**[1:49:43-1:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:49:43):**  sense. I can hook you up with Bob and we can have a great conversation about this. Like  there's a future episode with Bob Kenford coming pretty soon, I think. I just feel it  building.  
**[1:49:56-1:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:49:56):**  So going on this line of thought, so now the first tier of technology is going to be that  poly wire and geared reels and Cyclops chargers that everybody loves. Then we get past that  the next step of the technology tree that we want to have on replacing the herder and  
**[1:50:17-1:50:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:50:17):**  the instinctual knowledge of a herder. Well, now we've got things like vents and no fence,  which provide feedback to the animal, which is the same thing that the poly wire is doing,  the same thing that the Maasai herders are doing. They're providing instant feedback  
**[1:50:30-1:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:50:30):**  to the animal to keep it in the location. Okay, that's cool. That's great. Contrast  that with like a 7ox or a series tag, which is just giving you back information about  the animal, what state it's in, where it is, if it's eating, drinking, resting, and  
**[1:50:47-1:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:50:47):**  where it's been. Right. And all this information is useful. And I could definitely see use  cases for all four of these pieces of technology. But let's just go back to talking about vents  and no fence. The really big use case I see for them is not necessarily for cattle, wouldn't  
**[1:51:05-1:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:51:05):**  necessarily be on a ranch like mine, because I can pretty much get across it, I can fence  down with poly wire to a smaller area and a tighter stock density than would be within  the feasibility of the collar to control if that makes sense. Because when your stock  
**[1:51:26-1:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:51:26):**  density gets high, you know, they're always close to a boundary. So they're going to  be getting alerts more often, which is going to be more draining to the battery. So the  use case that I really see for these series and these vents collars is somebody between  
**[1:51:39-1:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:51:39):**  you and me, that's got some valley land for maybe some winter grazing and has mountain  leases or mountain ground. So when you go up to the mountain in the spring, you put  the collars on your program, and you have all their boundaries programmed in and every  
**[1:51:52-1:52:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:51:52):**  day in the morning, you just whip out your smartphone or you get on your computer, you  do your check in with all the all the collars or all the tags, and you see where everybody  is. Right? I can see it being like that there's a very, very strong use case for on public  
**[1:52:08-1:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:52:08):**  land on mixed herds, when you want to control those animals and exclude them from certain  areas, but you're dealing with a vast, vast landscape instead of, you know, trying to  tighten them down and control stock density at, you know, above 25,000 pounds per acre.  
**[1:52:24-1:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:52:24):**  Right? So I can definitely see a use case scenario for somebody in that situation and  probably even for you, you know, if you have a lot of terrain that gets to be inhospitable  to travel through, there's definitely a use case scenario because that you know, these  
**[1:52:39-1:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:52:39):**  collars will allow you to have those animals up there and being managed up there with a  lot more resolution and granularity than would be possible with with Polywire and a train  herder to do that job. Like that's, would it be possible to do it with a herder on foot  
**[1:53:00-1:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:53:00):**  with a dog 100% but that herd and the difference is going to be whereas, let's say you've got  a couple hundred sheep up in the mountains with with collars or tags on them that are  that are moving them around or excluding them for areas. The limitation to that is still  
**[1:53:20-1:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:53:20):**  it's technology. You're limited on what you can see on your screen. And how many times  you're going to go out and observe the animals to see how they're doing. Like, how, what  percentage of the forage they're eating in the paddock they're in. So my point is, is  
**[1:53:41-1:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:53:41):**  it a good tool? Yes. Are there use cases for these technologies? 100% Yes. But we can't  view them as a complete replacement for removing boots on the ground, eyes on the livestock  management on a daily basis. Because if we're not out there, you know, observing what our  
**[1:54:00-1:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:54:00):**  livestock are doing and getting the actual feedback from them that can only come with  your presence where your livestock are and on the land. I think we're going to end up  missing a lot of targets. And we're going to we're going to start maybe missing some  
**[1:54:19-1:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:54:19):**  some key benchmarks that we need to be looking for. Again, and then and we just say, well,  that's just a sacrifice we're going to make in the name of efficiency because of economies  of scale. So I think I think 701x tags are cool as hell. I think Vince Collars are cool.  
**[1:54:43-1:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:54:43):**  I think that the cost structure where they're at. I think some of them are way too expensive.  Even for cows, and I think some of them the difficult the difficulty is, okay, is the  efficiency and the return the return value per unit, right? Well, of course, we make  
**[1:55:16-1:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:55:16):**  more per unit of cow than we make per unit of sheep that we make per unit of chicken.  But then it becomes a turnover. Okay, you got to do 50,000 chickens to do what 300 cows  a year do, right? You know, I imagine the sheep and goat numbers at somewhere in the  
**[1:55:31-1:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:55:31):**  middle. So then we start to be if we're talking about putting a piece of technology on an  animal. Now that technology comes at a cost. It always comes at a cost. And where I get  to is the economics of it. Is it economical to put one of those things on a cow? That's  
**[1:55:59-1:56:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:55:59):**  it's easier to make that economic case. But when you're talking about a unit that costs,  you know, 15 or 20 or $100 for the tag or for the collar, does it become economical  to put them on sheep or goats? Because you have a much lower return per unit on a small  
**[1:56:19-1:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:56:19):**  ruminant than you do a cow. There's faster but there's faster turnover. But the problem  I just don't. It's hard for me to see on the published cost of any of these companies.  It's hard to make an economic use case scenario on sheep or goats. Just because of the high  
**[1:56:39-1:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:56:39):**  cost and the low margins on sheep and goats. So, like, I totally get where you're at, man.  I think that there's some fantastic potential applications for that technology. But the  cost of it and the cost of that technology, like, to apply to a small ruminant, that's  
**[1:57:02-1:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:57:02):**  going to be a big, big challenge. So, the whole other side of the coin for me for these  smart tags or smart collars is, you ever play Civilization on a computer? You ever play  that computer game? I know what it is, but no, I've never played it.  
**[1:57:29-1:57:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:57:29):**  Okay. If anybody out there plays games or anything like that, like when you're playing  these big simulation games, there's a technology tree that you have to unlock. Okay, you start  at the bottom, like one of the first things to unlock is a granary. And then you unlock  
**[1:57:41-1:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:57:41):**  a library. And as you go through the game, you get the ability to build these structures  which unlock other things. And you don't have microchips without refining. You don't have  refining without mining. You don't have mining without, you know, certain types of tools.  
**[1:58:03-1:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:58:03):**  So in order to make microchips, in order to make a microchip and a battery energy dense  enough that communicates with a satellite in outer space to determine its location on  the surface of the Earth within five feet in real time. It's a pretty simple thing that  
**[1:58:25-1:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:58:25):**  we're all very used to by now because we carry around a supercomputer in our pockets. And  we can ask this stupid thing any question we want and it will give us a pretty good  answer. We can tell if we want to go anywhere and it'll give us the best route, the shortest  
**[1:58:37-1:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:58:37):**  route and the most fuel efficient route. But it's a piece of technology. And if we want  to build all this technology that requires a fully unlocked technology tree to replace  what any human being can do from birth and say we're making progress, it's a little difficult  
**[1:59:09-1:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:59:09):**  for me to get there. Because really at the end of the day, that's what we're doing. Okay,  we're trying to, we're going to put these collars or these ear tags on cattle. Why?  So we can control where they're at. We can check on their health. We can see how they're  
**[1:59:25-1:59:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:59:25):**  doing. We know where they're supposed to be. We can move them around. Great. That's a herder's  job. Like you just described a Peruvian herder and a border collie to me. And that's where  we're getting to. And I think earlier we made, I made a comment about labor economics of  
**[1:59:46-2:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=1:59:46):**  food. And this is another part of that equation of labor economics of food. So have we gotten  to the point where there's, where this technology is so heavily subsidized and energy is just  so ridiculously cheap that we are doing things like using microchips and satellite GPS to  
**[2:00:10-2:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:00:10):**  replace what a human being should be able to do with a minimal amount of training? I  don't know. You asked about it. That's my take on it.  It was great. I get very enamored of like the tech solutions. It's always fun to think  
**[2:00:28-2:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:00:28):**  about, but I think at the very end though, that was an interesting point you were bringing  up is that to some degree, part of my interest in vents or no fence or whatever is that it  is not easy to hire in a skilled herder. I mean, you certainly don't go into town and  
**[2:00:47-2:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:00:47):**  put a job listing on the farm store board. Hey, need a herdsman, you know, so that skill  doesn't exist culturally. Like you were just saying, then you're talking about Peruvians  and that.  
**[2:01:00-2:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:01:00):**  It's a high skill job. If you find the person that's got the high enough skills, you can't  afford them. And if you find enough, you find the person you can't afford for the price  that you're offering, they're not skilled enough to do the job.  
**[2:01:11-2:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:01:11):**  Right. So, so that's, and that's not, and that's happening all through agriculture,  right? That's, you know, you don't California, we have a huge migrant worker population that  comes through and picks all the grapes and the tomatoes and the strawberries and all  
**[2:01:29-2:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:01:29):**  that sort of stuff. And they're, they're not coming any more. Not let alone policies, border  control policies, but just that they don't, they don't come here anymore. So that there  is a, there's a huge shift in agriculture away from manual labor towards some sort of  
**[2:01:47-2:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:01:47):**  roboticized, mechanical, mechanized, digitized, like, it seems like that is the wave of the  future. So I agree. I think it's much, much cooler idea to have Miguel out there with  the border collie, you know, grazing the sheep around, but that's finding Miguel or pick  
**[2:02:09-2:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:02:09):**  a name. Like, how do you find him? How do you train him? How do you keep him fully employed?  You know, as it becomes the labor issue becomes interesting. And I think that is happening  to not just us specifically in my crazy goat and sheep idea, but that to all of us in our  
**[2:02:30-2:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:02:30):**  culture, no matter where you are, you know, who's gonna, who's gonna change the pivots  out there in the plains around you, right? I mean, if you have any water left, but other  than that, right? I mean, you know, that also gets into this whole corporate thing you've  
**[2:02:42-2:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:02:42):**  asked about earlier that you get bigger, and then you can kind of afford all this mechanized  stuff. And I don't know, now, now I'm just rambling. But I think my one little question  about the really cool electronic fence stuff like can immediately dives into this almost  
**[2:03:01-2:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:03:01):**  existential crisis that agriculture is entering into. Because we talked about in our pre interview  that the the demographics, right, that the oldest generation is now the biggest, right?  Basically every generation is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. Yep. So I mean, just  
**[2:03:19-2:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:03:19):**  on a very huge high level population level that the workers are not they do not physically  exist, let alone are they in your neighborhood, they just don't exist in the population in  general. So who the hell is going to do all this work because those older mouths still  
**[2:03:35-2:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:03:35):**  need to eat, at least for a few more decades, but there's no one left to grow the food form  and least and take care of them. Yeah, this and support the tax base. Yeah, that's just  a whole nother can of worms that you like to open, right?  
**[2:03:52-2:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:03:52):**  Yeah, it's definitely going to be interesting moving through the next 10 or 1520 years in  agriculture and seeing what happens with let's just face it, a lot of the current producers  aging out. Because it's it's gonna happen. I mean, it's gonna happen to you, it's gonna  
**[2:04:14-2:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:04:14):**  happen to me. And hopefully it won't happen to us for the next 20 years. But right, we'll  get to see the current gender, you know, one of the current generations go ahead and age  out and see how that see how that shakes out. It's, it's going to be interesting. And I  
**[2:04:27-2:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:04:27):**  think that we have as a society in the next 15 to 20 years, that there's going to be some  interesting things happen. I'm not even gonna say interesting decisions that are going to  have to be made. I'm just going to say there's going to be some interesting things that we're  
**[2:04:47-2:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:04:47):**  going to have to choose to what we're going to prioritize. Are we going to prioritize  cheap food? Are we going to prioritize the health of the land? Are we going to put people  to work? Or is everybody going to have a universal wage and we're going to rely on environmentally  
**[2:05:01-2:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/95-Tyler-Dawley-Full-Circle-Grass-Fed-e1scdra#t=2:05:01):**  destructive technological solutions to sustain us? Are we going to try to put more people  back on the land? Or are we going to convert everything to corporate farming? I think that  the like, the challenges in the labor economics of food production, and we're seeing like

What is it you guys are with these days?  Soil region, region mills, and heritage ground.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:04):**  Oh, nice.  Yeah, we don't like to start just one business.  Triple threats.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:08):**  Gotta have clusters.  Gotta have clusters.  So Russell, tell us a little bit about yourself.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:15):**  I don't know you at all.  Where are you at and where are you from?  I'm a first generation farmer in Hickory, North Carolina.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:23):**  We're about an hour above Charlotte, about an hour below Asheville.  So we're right up the foothill of the mountains and started farming back in 2012 and just  grew our operation from there, used regenerative practices, direct marketing, vertical integration,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:39):**  and really trying to be outside of the normal farmer in the commodity market.  I really want to circle back later and get into how you came to regenerative agriculture.  But let's introduce Liz.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:01:52):**  Liz, tell us a little bit about yourself.  Yeah, so I live in Toledo, Texas.  I'm a soil scientist and ecosystem scientist.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:00):**  I got into this in a kind of a roundabout way.  Started working for a soil testing lab for one of my bartending clients, actually.  So that got me down this whole path.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:15):**  And now here I am doing regenerative ag and very excited about it.  Bartending for one of your soil testing clients?  Yeah, see, I haven't ever told that story before.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:27):**  One of my regulars had a soil testing lab at the bar I worked at and gave me a job running  it.  That's fun.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:35):**  You know, I suppose a lot of people have heard of the Haney test.  Did you have anything to do with that?  Yeah, it was Rick's brainchild.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:45):**  But we worked in the same lab together in the same facility.  And so I helped, you know, bounce the ideas off, write the papers and helped in the lab  a little bit.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:02:59):**  And so it was there along the whole journey with that.  So it sounds like you kind of came to like agriculture and science a little bit late  in life.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:03:09):**  Yes.  Yeah, I grew up in West Texas in Midland, Texas out in the desert, where it's, you know,  like one cow per 1000 acres, because they can't grow anything there.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:03:22):**  It's all been eroded away, dust bowl scenario happening every day.  So I wasn't around agriculture at all.  My parents weren't involved in agriculture.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:03:31):**  So it just happened by chance, thank goodness.  And then got into farming, you know, I don't farm but got into the ag business later in  life.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:03:41):**  How did you come to realize that soil was so important?  So one, I really enjoyed like working in the lab with it.  I loved learning about it.  
**[0:03:51-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:03:51):**  We were doing all chemical analyses at that time.  After a while, though, you know, a lot of people kept coming to our house and talking  about regenerative agriculture and soil and in while I had been involved in the research  
**[0:04:07-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:04:07):**  aspect and in the analysis aspect, I wasn't as like excited about it as I was until after  I realized that, wait a minute, this might like save the planet for my kids.  So now I have little kids, all of this stuff just clicked in me at one time.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:04:27):**  And I started to realize that, okay, if I don't start really advocating for the soil  biology, regenerative ag, the farmers that are involved in it, then, you know, I'm not  really doing my life and I'm not doing anything.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:04:43):**  That's that's awesome.  So how many kids do you have?  Tell us about your kids a little bit.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:04:47):**  Two kids, Maggie and Molly.  And Molly is eight.  And Maggie is about to turn 12.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:04:54):**  And they are somewhat soil nerds, not as much as me, but they're super great kids.  And we get to take them with us on all these fun adventures we go on meeting all of our  our farmers and introducing them into the world of ag.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:09):**  It seems like you guys are always posting pictures or somewhere new almost every week.  I'd like to be somewhere new every week.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:18):**  So so let's talk about Ag Soil Regen.  What?  Tell me all about it.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:22):**  What are you guys doing these days?  OK, so I started Soil Regen in 2019 and started putting together events and stuff, then put  it on the back burner when I went to go work for, you know, industry corporations had to  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:37):**  set it aside for a while.  And then this past summer, we all actually got to start seeing each other again after  Covid.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:46):**  And so Russell sent us a text one day and said, this is what we need to do.  We need to revamp Soil Regen, get it up and going.  So went home, quit my corporate job.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:05:58):**  And here we are getting it kicked back up again with the real focus that that we want  to do education and consulting, not only on a general basis where someone comes to a conference  and learns about how to you know, the principles of regenerative ag and and maybe how to do  
**[0:06:18-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:06:18):**  a little bit on the land, but really take it all the way to their farm and help them  all along the process.  So how how would you define regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:06:28):**  Because it's been defined a ton of times.  But I want to hear your definition of trying to farm as best as you can in nature's image  while in your context.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:06:38):**  I think that's my favorite so far.  It's not prescriptive.  No, no, no.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:06:44):**  We don't need to be hardcore about that.  Right.  I want to throw the same question at Russell.  
**[0:06:49-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:06:49):**  So what what defines regenerative agriculture for you, Russell?  On a personal level, regenerative agriculture for me is any practice that farmers can do  to make the land better than how they found it.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:07:03):**  I don't I don't think it necessarily has to be one practice or another or cutting anything  out.  I think as long as you're making the ground better, where it makes more nutritional food  
**[0:07:14-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:07:14):**  or whether it's simply growing crops with less fertilizer or less chemicals, anything  that we can do to make the ground sustainable, I think sustainable was a buzzword before  its time.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:07:25):**  I think regenerative makes it sustainable.  We have to regenerate back to a place where we can be sustainable because it's not sustainable  right now.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:07:33):**  Yeah, that's that's exactly how I feel about it.  So the revamp that Liz was talking about, it sounds like you drove that what was that  a covid inspired thing or did it just come to you in the middle of the night?  
**[0:07:46-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:07:46):**  It all you know, the joke between me and Liz, it all started with a road trip and bourbon.  I think covid really put a damper on everybody's mood across the country and in every industry.  And simply getting back out and you know, the sunshine being back on your face and getting  
**[0:08:05-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:08:05):**  to see friends and really looking at how farmers have struggled even more economically over  the past year with, you know, we had the same issue on our farm.  It was hard to get what we needed.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:08:22):**  It was hard to get what we needed on our farm to operate.  And it was hard for farmers to get information for them to change their operations into a  better way.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:08:31):**  And I guess I guess I really just wanted to put something together to where we can help  farmers.  And I think that's our our main focus is farmers are first.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:08:39):**  And it hasn't been that way for a long time.  So Liz, what are Russell, what are some of the events that you all have put on lately?  And what kind of reception have you gotten?  
**[0:08:48-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:08:48):**  Yeah, so we're just getting ramped up, starting to put on events.  And our first one is going to be, is it November 15th and 16th, I believe in Pratt, Kansas.  And then we have a really big one scheduled December 6th and 7th, called Inventively the  
**[0:09:07-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:09:07):**  Big Soil Health event in Iowa.  So those are the two bigger ones that we're getting going.  And we really just started putting all this together, all three businesses about August.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:09:23):**  So we're trying to do three years worth of work in about three months.  But so far, the reception has been great.  People are very supportive.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:09:34):**  I think that farmers first understand that we're here because of them and for them, and  that we're not here just, you know, to toot our own horns.  And I think that people really are responding to the jinn of that.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:09:50):**  So that event that you mentioned in Pratt in November, this episode will definitely  be out by then.  And that's Pratt's my backyard.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:10:01):**  So I'm going to definitely try to cruise up there and see what that's all about.  So what kind of things can I expect that program?  Okay, so this is being hosted by Great Plains Regeneration in cooperation with Prairie Food  
**[0:10:16-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:10:16):**  and Soil Region.  And so the first day is going to be soil health discussions.  There'll be some keynote speakers.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:10:25):**  People will get a lot of information about regenerative ag and practices.  And then the second day is more of a workshop, more in depth on how to do the soil health  practices and how to apply prairie food and what that does a lot about soil testing.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:10:42):**  There'll be lots of great food as well.  Barbecue cooked by Regent Ag Lab and Lance Gunderson.  So it's going to be a great fun event for people to really get together and learn the  
**[0:10:55-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:10:55):**  boots on the ground kind of information.  You had me sold at soil health discussions, but you know, the food sealed the deal.  Yeah, food, barbecue, meat.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:04):**  That's how to get people to show up though.  I mean, sometimes you got to say, hey, meat, barbecue, prime rib.  We're going to have regenerative turkey grown by Sarah Barble there.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:16):**  So who is also our business partner.  Awesome.  Awesome.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:20):**  I'm looking forward to that.  So before we before I get away from it, where can we go to find out more information about  that event and Pratt and I'll make sure I put a link in the show notes page.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:30):**  Okay.  Yeah.  So if you go to Great Plains Regeneration website, it's on there.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:35):**  And then it's also listed.  There's a link on soil region website, which is agsoilregion.com.  Okay, perfect.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:44):**  So this this new thing that you guys have going on this trailer, I really want to know  about the trailer.  Whose idea was the trailer?  
**[0:11:52-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:11:52):**  So essentially, the way it started was a company and we'll be nice and leave it at that.  A company made an offer to farmers that if they grew regenerative grains, that they were  going to build a massive processing facility.

And then it would be ground up into regenerative products and then sold and marketed that way.  And they were offered a very small premium, just say 50 cents or $1 a bushel more to bring  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:12:26):**  their grains to that facility.  And the problem is, even though it is regenerative grains, that's no different than our current  model system.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:12:34):**  Truck your grains halfway across the country or to the local elevator, you may get a small  premium, they may dock you.  And at the end of the day, the farmers still taking all the risks.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:12:44):**  And essentially, companies are farming the farmer.  I guess that's my saying that I'm tired of people farming the farmer.  It's time for the farmers to make money.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:12:54):**  And after that idea came out and then those people didn't go through with it.  I was just like, well, I'll just build it in a trailer.  And everybody's like, you can't do that.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:04):**  That won't work.  And I talked to Liz and Sarah about it.  And they've always been supportive.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:09):**  I think we support each other very well.  And they were like, all right, let's do it.  So we figured out what trailer size we needed, how much weight was going to be towed around.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:22):**  Everybody thought this was going to be in a tractor trailer.  This is in a eight by 20 car trailer, an enclosed trailer that you can pull behind a pickup  truck.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:30):**  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to picture it.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:33):**  So sorry.  Yeah.  Yes.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:36):**  Essentially, just imagine an eight by 20 car trailer that is now going to house a milling  operation that anybody with a regular driver's license can pull this thing around.  And I was picturing an 18 wheeler.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:48):**  Yeah, no.  Yeah.  It's not big at all.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:52):**  And we can process grits and cornmeal.  We can do flour.  We can do extracted flour.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:13:58):**  We can do cracks.  We can do berries.  We can do gluten free.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:03):**  Essentially, any product that you can buy in a grocery store, we can make in this trailer.  We're even learning how to do like wet grinding where we can make masa for tortillas or chips.  Yeah, that's nothing says nothing says love like somebody bringing you some tacos.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:20):**  Tacos love.  Exactly.  Every day.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:24):**  Everybody should every every day should be Taco Tuesday.  But um, I don't know, it was just something that I was I'm pretty I'm a gearhead.  I like welding.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:33):**  I like building things that nobody's done before.  And especially if somebody tells me we can't do something, it's gonna have  Oh hell yeah, good.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:39):**  I like him already.  So is this like is, is it a community type, type offering, then you provide the regenerative  food for this community and they just have they have the right infrastructure to haul  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:14:53):**  it around.  So every farmer already has at least some form of grain storage, whether it be short  term or long term.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:01):**  There's there's not any massive equipment that farmers have to buy to be a part of this  meal.  Right now, we have 18 farmers, I believe in 14 states, there is a one time upfront fee  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:13):**  for farmers to join.  And that covers us building the e commerce, the websites, we're putting their information  on there.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:19):**  And, you know, a word that I learned from Liz was identity preservation.  Nobody will have that the way that we do it.  So essentially, our front of our bags will be all the same with a consistent brand, but  
**[0:15:32-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:32):**  the back of the bags will actually have the information of the farmer who grew that specific  grain.  And then the customer can go to our website and check out their bios and videos.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:43):**  They can check out the information about that specific farmer and how their food was actually  grown in that bag.  What can you not do with with grains in that trailer?  
**[0:15:54-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:15:54):**  What can you not do with your meal that that say a big stationary meal could or big commercial  milk could?  Honestly, the only difference between what a big commercial meal can do and what we can  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:04):**  do is would be speed.  But speed does not always equal quality.  We are using a pink granite stone meal.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:13):**  I have a friend that actually his family built some of the oldest meals in the southeast,  some of them that are still standing for 200 years now.  And he actually helped us with our grinding process on our farm that we've done since  
**[0:16:27-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:27):**  2017.  And we're focused more on the quality of the grain and the quality of the ground versus  putting out massive quantities and trying to hit box stores.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:37):**  That's that's not something we're not trying to make something cheap and hit a box store  and try to sell massive quantity.  We're looking at the return on investment to the farmer.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:45):**  You're trying to help people get that get a specialty product out there for a niche  to make a significant amount of money on a very small amount of quantity of product.  Exactly.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:16:56):**  Exactly.  So I mean, go ahead, Liz.  I was just going to say, you know, to give you an idea, I mean, Sarah is very good at  
**[0:17:05-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:17:05):**  putting together our spreadsheets and our information and the average return on investment  to the farmer after after we meal it, after we bag it, even taking into consideration  their operating costs to grow it on their farm, just regular whole wheat flour.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:17:21):**  Their return on investment is somewhere in the ballpark of about four to $5,000 net per  acre.  It would take almost 80 to 100 acres of commodity wheat for them to have the same return on  
**[0:17:32-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:17:32):**  investment as one acre of ground wheat.  And then, you know, corn is even more exponentially to grow 100 bushel an acre of non GMO heirloom  corn.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:17:43):**  You know, their profit margin, their net is somewhere in the ballpark of about fifteen  to eighteen thousand dollars.  And we don't expect farmers to go sell 100 acres of this.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:17:53):**  But if you can replace 200 acres of risk, which, you know, in today's commodity prices  and where where our input prices are, it costs you almost ten thousand dollars to grow that  200 acres versus five hundred dollars or four hundred dollars.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:18:09):**  There's a huge risk benefit there as well that we're reducing risk while also increasing  profitability.  And, you know, I think input costs are something that's really important to think about because,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:18:20):**  you know, just in the last year, a lot of complex supply chains are failing.  Complex supply chain failure has been on my mind, especially we're just coming off the  heels of Facebook being down for a couple hours.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:18:33):**  And I don't know, there's a bunch of people that thought the world seemed to end, but  there's nothing wrong with a little enforced digital detox for three point five million  users of Facebook.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:18:44):**  Anyway, you know, things that are big and complex are prone to failure.  And this is this is just another way to add resiliency back to a smaller farm and access  some of these other markets.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:18:59):**  So it's almost like this is the this is the answer to the question a lot of people haven't  thought to ask yet, which is where do I sell this regenerative grain, this regenerative  heirloom grain?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:19:09):**  Exactly.  And they haven't been getting the return on investment for the hard work that they've  put in figuring out these practices all over the country for themselves.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:19:21):**  And and we want them to benefit from all the hard work they're doing to fix the land and  teach other people how to do that.  And especially the consumers, which is why we're not interested in selling in the industrial  
**[0:19:37-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:19:37):**  food complex, because we're breaking out of the industrial ag system by doing regenerative  agriculture in the first place.  Then why do we want to jump right back into it?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:19:46):**  Right.  Such a good way to look at it.  Well, and you know, Brian, you brought up the supply chain issues.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:19:51):**  If you look at even in the last two weeks, China just released the announcement that  they're not going to export phosphorus out of their country until the end of 2022.  That's 49% of the phosphorus that we use in ag.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:05):**  And now there's shortages in fertilizer, and shortages in chemicals and natural gas prices  are going record high, too, which has downstream effects on fertilizer price.  Yeah.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:18):**  So like our local suppliers are saying they may not even have liquid 32% nitrogen this  spring.  Okay, so that does validate.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:25):**  I've been hearing just expect your food prices to go up 30 to 40%.  If not more.  Yeah, at least.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:34):**  They're talking about a 10% reduction in world food production next year.  And if you think that there's a direct correlation, you're crazy.  If it goes, if our food production goes down 10%, food costs will go up well over that.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:49):**  Okay.  And there will be people that can't get enough to eat.  Like 10% is a big deal.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:20:55):**  Like we don't, we overproduce a lot, but it's not that much.  And we just came off of a shortage this year.  So South America made half of their crop last year.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:05):**  If you follow their reports right now, they're applying less fertilizer because they can't  get it to actually apply to the crop at planting time.  You're looking at a shortfall in Ukraine on their wheat production.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:19):**  China's already cutting back on their number of corn acres because they can't get the seed  and chemical for it.  And they're the ones making it as far as the chemical goes.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:27):**  So it's coming off of a short year and know that you're going into another short year  is a very bad scenario.  Some of these other shortages, I can wrap my head around like microchip shortage.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:40):**  Okay.  I get that.  Like any burps along that line have huge ramifications downstream, but phosphorus, it's like to get  
**[0:21:49-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:49):**  phosphorus and phosphates for fertilizer, that's almost something you can kind of dig  out of the ground in a simple chemical process and then you can apply it.  Am I wrong there?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:21:59):**  That's a general overview.  Yes.  It's mined, it's processed and it's either in granular or liquid form.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:22:04):**  And then we apply it appropriately to the type.  So I start to wonder where the bottleneck is, if the bottleneck is in production, like  the base resource or in the processing or in the shipping.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:22:17):**  The bottleneck right now is the global power shortage.  I mean, they're looking at the natural gas that runs these plants that they're converting  the natural gas into ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:22:36):**  It really comes down to the global shortage of natural gas and crude oil has not kept  up as people are finally, essentially like we were talking about earlier, coming out  of their homes and now gas is being used more than what it was a year ago and oil production  
**[0:22:53-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:22:53):**  hasn't kept up.  So oil prices are going up and it's just a simple fact of they don't have enough gas.  Basically in the UK, the report that came out two days ago, they have to choose between  
**[0:23:06-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:23:06):**  heating homes this winter or making fertilizer.  And right now they have a little bit of food, but the one thing I've learned is hungry people  are angry people.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:23:16):**  So they're going to have to figure out how are we going to maintain food production with  less nutrient application?  And for me on my farm, that's where the Haney test comes in.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:23:27):**  We've cut back dramatically on our inputs utilizing a test as simple as the Haney test.  Explain that a little bit.  So how did a test tell you that you're using too much?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:23:40):**  So being a first-generation farmer, all I knew about going into this was that you put  seed in the ground and eventually you had something to harvest.  There have been so many valuable lessons learned in nine years.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:23:53):**  And the Haney test, if you pull a conventional state ran test, it doesn't matter what state  in the country, Olson, Bray, Mehlich-1, Mehlich-2, doesn't matter.  They only look at phosphorus and potassium in the test and they don't actually test for  
**[0:24:09-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:24:09):**  nitrogen.  And if you do get a nitrogen test, PSNT, it's only looking at nitrate nitrogen.  And the thing about the Haney test is they found, you know, at least it may be more now,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:24:20):**  but at least 23 forms of organic nitrogen that are plant available.  And so by me planting cover crops and having higher biology counts and more nutrient mineralization,  the Haney test looks at all that.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:24:33):**  It's got biological indicators with the CO2 burst.  It's got our food source for the microbes, which is the Weok, the water extractable organic  carbon.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:24:43):**  There's so many different things on that test that I can look at at a farmer and make my  nutrient recommendations off of that versus, you know, something that never happens on  my farm.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:24:53):**  I mean, that was the big seller is if you're using hydrochloric acid as your concentrate  to force covalent bonds apart to test soil solutions, it never rains hydrochloric acid  on my farm.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:06):**  And then I'd be worried.  Yeah.  And then the first time I went down to Texas, like Liz was talking about, I think there's  
**[0:25:11-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:11):**  so many people that have made the journey down to Texas to meet her and Rick and Rick's  like, yeah, we use water and some root exudates.  And I'm like, holy cow, my ground sees that this is a test that would mimic what's actually  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:26):**  in my soil solution.  And you know, that was my that was my aha moment that, well, maybe we should give this  a try.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:34):**  Who would have thought to use water, the universal solvent as a universal solvent?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Yeah, that would be Rick.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:42):**  Simple.  Do you have anything else to say about the Haney soil test and the differences right  now, Liz?  
**[0:25:52-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:25:52):**  Well, I know, like one thing he touched on is nitrogen.  So on average, it finds between probably 30 and 40 pounds of available nitrogen that we  couldn't see before.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:26:06):**  And part of that is from the way it's extracted.  But part of that is because also instrumentation has come a long way.  And soil testing has not come a long way.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:26:16):**  We're still using or most labs are still using anywhere from 60 to 50 year old methods, and  it hasn't advanced with technology.  And you know, people like to give the example, it's not you're not carrying around a rotary  
**[0:26:31-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:26:31):**  dial phone with you everywhere you go anymore.  So why are we still using these really old methods to measure stuff that may or may not  be there by the time you plant your crop?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:26:42):**  We carry around pocket supercomputers and it doesn't rain hydrochloric acid.  Yeah, that's the moral of the story.  So Russell, have you like totally discontinued conventional soil testing?  
**[0:26:54-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:26:54):**  Or is that something you did a little bit more?  Have you compared the results, I guess is what I'm asking.  So the moral of the story on our farm is we started with conventional testing.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:27:06):**  And then I got introduced to the Haines.  And my district conservationist is probably been one of the best people that I had in  my operation because he said, don't stop, don't stop the other testing, use that to  
**[0:27:19-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:27:19):**  compare the two.  And we still pull the state sample, we still send some to private labs, and we're pulling  the millet three, which is what's used in our area.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:27:29):**  And every year for 200 bushel corn, they keep saying, apply 250 units of nitrogen.  And so there are fields that we do check strips in, and we'll apply the university recommendation.  And then I would send a sample down to the temple and, you know, utilize Rick's lab or  
**[0:27:47-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:27:47):**  now we're going to the Lantz-Gunderstand at Regen Ag Labs, and we would pull a Haney test  and it said apply 60 or 80 units of nitrogen.  And we would do that on most of the farm.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:27:59):**  And we were making 190, 200, you know, the best corn we've ever grown was 318 bushels  and acre dry land.  And the difference between applying 80 units of nitrogen and the 250 units of nitrogen  
**[0:28:12-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:28:12):**  was about six bushels.  And if you look at the cost there, yes, I made those extra six bushels, but I also spent  $130 more an acre in nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:28:22):**  And that's not good for my pocket.  It's only good for the fertilizer salesman's pocket.  And so yeah, we, we still to this day, actually still pull a conventional test to have those  
**[0:28:34-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:28:34):**  comparisons and the big number that I think farmers should look at is if you grow 1000  acres of corn, and you had the same Haney results that I have, you could save over $100,000  a year in fertilizer.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:28:49):**  $100,000.  That's huge.  Or spend it to get six bushels to the average.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:28:54):**  Or spend that $100,000 to make an extra five grand.  That's like the feed salesman coming to you and telling you this magic feed block will  raise your conception from 95 to 97.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:05):**  Yeah, what's the cost there, buddy?  Well, it's, it's, it's, it is true.  Everybody farms the farmer.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:11):**  When I started going to farm shows, and I went to this booth, if I use their product,  it added five bushels.  And if I went to the next booth, their product added six bushels, and so on and so forth.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:21):**  And if you went to 40 booths like that at the Southern farm show, and you use them all,  you should be growing 600 bushel corn.  And and essentially, it's some of them work, but do they give you a return on investment?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:33):**  And if some of them do work, was it because your soil system, soil system wasn't functioning  properly.  And I think that's where soil region comes in.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:41):**  If we educate farmers, there's so many people out there that talk about soil health, and  talk about microbiology, and talk about all the things in the function.  And that's great.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:29:51):**  That's information that farmers need to know.  But how many companies are out there telling you how to set up your drill, how to set up  your sprayer, how to plan into this residue and terminate it.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:01):**  And that's where I think that we really have to educate farmers is the practical application  of putting this stuff together so that they can have success with it and not just the  theory behind it.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:12):**  That comment that you've made several times, people farming the farmers, well, that probably  going to be the title for the episode unless you say something even cooler than that.  But it's true.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:23):**  It's absolutely true.  You know, you drive to town, and the tractor dealers got a nice new building and a row  of shiny tractors out front.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:32):**  The crop consulting guys, they're driving around in new vehicles.  The irrigation folks, they're driving around in new vehicles.  The farm credit folks, they're driving around in new vehicles.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:42):**  And none of them would be there if it wasn't for the farmers.  Yeah, and they're all those companies, and I know because I've worked for some, they're  out there to impress investors.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:30:53):**  And they're out there to impress the other industrial ag people.  And where I found the failure is when I tried to tell these people, your largest commodity  is the farmer that you're working with.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:31:08):**  Speak their language, learn about them, help them, and then you'll be successful.  That falls on deaf ears.  And you know, that's why I clear it all.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:31:19):**  And now you're also doing a lot of work helping regenerative farmers market product, right?  Yes, yes.  So Sarah and I, Sarah is running the e-commerce site, and she's doing all the research on  
**[0:31:33-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:31:33):**  that.  And we both work on the marketing side and how to speak to the consumer and really also  trying to help other companies how to speak to the consumer and understand the farmer.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:31:46):**  What really is surprising is, is we can help to tell that message.  But when we bring in like Russell or some of the other farmers to speak to them, they  really start to get it.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:31:59):**  And not everybody will get it or understand it.  But the people that do, those are the ones that we want to help succeed.  So what are some of the tools that farmers can use to help communicate to their consumers  
**[0:32:15-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:32:15):**  about their story of what they produce and why?  Really it's the personal story, in my opinion.  And what I find interesting is that, and I did this even within the industry, is that  
**[0:32:27-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:32:27):**  farmers don't think that what they're doing is interesting.  And they don't know how to tell that story or have the time in doing it.  And most of them are very modest and don't really think that they're doing that amazing  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:32:41):**  of things.  But they are.  And so as someone who grew up in the city, I can't tell you how much I love watching  
**[0:32:49-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:32:49):**  people on videos crimping ground.  It is the most satisfying thing to watch on the face of the planet.  And actually I like being an attractor and doing it.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:32:59):**  So once people can see what other people are doing and learn about those practices, the  more they're going to respect the farmers themselves and the products they get and the  food that they're eating, they'll become healthier, more involved.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:33:15):**  And I think it just really builds the whole community to support the ag industry, not  industry, but the ag farmer.  When you talk to new farmers, Liz, who are maybe, I hate to say conventional background,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:33:29):**  but maybe not sold into the region.  How does that conversation, do you ever get pushback of what you're doing or anything  like that?  
**[0:33:37-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:33:37):**  Well, an example would be I messaged a farmer that I know here locally and said, this is  what we're doing.  I know that he has some specialty markets that said, told him, you know, we're working  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:33:51):**  with regenerative farmers.  Are you growing your stuff regeneratively?  We're going to have a mobile mill.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:33:58):**  And he just said, oh, that's neat.  So there, it does fall on deaf ears.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:34:04):**  I'm thinking about whenever Brian and I talked to just new ranchers, sometimes we have to  figure out where they're at to meet them first for that conversation is like, okay, well,  where are you at first before I just like try to sell you this Kool-Aid that I totally  
**[0:34:20-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:34:20):**  am into and I love, but I sometimes I have to give them little shots of Kool-Aid instead  of just like the whole, you know, gallon jug.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:34:31):**  You have to meet people where they're at.  And and some of our best friends are recreational tillers, and they've known us for 20 years,  and they still won't listen to us.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:34:44):**  And maybe that's just because they know us too well, but it just, you know, some people  just just won't want to hear.  I was just gonna say that I was a full time fireman before I became a farmer.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:34:56):**  And I guess my saying when I go talk to farmers is farmers and firemen are creatures of habit.  And we have had the wrong policies in place for probably the last 80 years.  We still have farm bill policies in place from the original farm bill in the 1920s.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:35:13):**  I think it's 1928 was the exact year temporary man.  Yes.  And, you know, back then people were starving in the Great Depression and absolutely do

**[0:35:30-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:35:30):**  Some are good, some are not so good.  But it really honestly to get a farmer to change, it's either social pressure or economical  pressure.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:35:41):**  And they either are going broke in the model system, or, you know, five or 10 years ago,  you would have never saw anything about soil health or regenerative practices in a magazine,  or an awesome podcast by Brian Alexander.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:35:56):**  You know, or that's what I'm saying.  Like I feel like the snowball is finally rolling down the hill.  And farmers are taking a look whether they adopt all of the practices or even some of  
**[0:36:07-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:07):**  the practices, but at least there is a change and questions being asked,  because it's not necessarily like that there's a goal for regenerative agriculture or soil  health.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:18):**  It's a journey.  Like, absolutely.  It's a journey.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:22):**  And it's just it's progress.  We're always trying to make it better looking for the next thing to make make the system  stronger, make a complex system that's that's interdependent, but failure resistant.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:33):**  And that's the ultimate goal is build resiliency.  I mean, climate change is real, it rains harder and faster, and then you don't get rain for  a longer period of time or fertilizer may be unavailable or chemicals may be unavailable.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:48):**  And it's really just building a system that is resilient.  I think you hit the nail on the head with that one.  And a big part of that is you got to reduce your inputs, you have to reduce your reliance  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:36:57):**  on inputs.  Because these days, you know, you don't know where any of these commodities are coming  from or where they're going.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:37:04):**  And it doesn't take much to start some really, really weird things in the global supply chains  as much as they're interconnected.  So the I want to circle back to the mill trailer, how, if you don't mind sharing, like roughly  
**[0:37:18-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:37:18):**  how much did it cost to put together and how scalable of an operation is it?  So as far as that's, that's one of the I think Liz's trigger words is scalable.  See the last I knew it.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:37:33):**  As far as you know, how many farmers can we service if if one person was to run this meal  full time, and that's 2000 hours a year of running time, we could do almost a million  pounds of product out of one trailer.  
**[0:37:49-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:37:49):**  And we really made it feasible to where it already used the infrastructure.  So farmers have gravity boxes, they already have gravity wagons or dump truck for grain.  And we built a four inch poly auger that comes out the side of it.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:38:05):**  And we can directly dump into that we tried to make it less labor intensive to where we're  not touching the product until it's actually in the bagging process.  And you know, kind of streamlining that but yet to do to do 800,000 to a million pounds  
**[0:38:20-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:38:20):**  a year per trailer.  That's a lot of farmers.  That's a lot of product that we could do over a large area, and simply making it to where  
**[0:38:30-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:38:30):**  it could be towed behind a pickup truck instead of having to have a CDLs really, it made the  accessibility a lot easier to where, you know, a farmer can meet another farmer with it or,  you know, it's it's not restrictive on, you know, time of transportation.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:38:46):**  It's really not allowed process at all.  So you know, as far as the noise complaint, we could run this thing in the middle of the  night and it's it's quieter than a grain bin fan.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:38:55):**  So if a farmer's drying grain in a grain bin, nobody would even notice that, you know, we  were there making a product.  How skilled of an operation is it to operate?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:39:04):**  Grits and cornmeal would be the easiest to make.  And you know, it depends on where you're at geographically, you know, they're not eating  a ton of grits in Nebraska, I wouldn't think.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:39:16):**  But down here in the southeast, if you don't have grits once a day, you know, they'll take  your southern cart away from you.  But you know, it, you can change the parameters of the stone where you have a larger gap or  
**[0:39:29-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:39:29):**  a shorter gap to where we can make more grits than cornmeal.  Or if we're in the Midwest and they want more cornmeal, we can tighten the stone down and  make more cornmeal than grits.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:39:40):**  You know, the functionality of it is is not very hard.  The sifting of the flowers.  It's not bad.  
**[0:39:48-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:39:48):**  I think you could train somebody within probably two to three weeks on how to look at it, how  to how to understand how the process works.  I mean, it's, it's something that's definitely teachable to anyone who would be interested  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:01):**  in actually being a part of the meal.  We wanted to make it where I could drive it around and run it.  Yeah, if that tells you anything.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:08):**  It's perfect.  Everything should be easy to operate.  Easy, simple, easy to drive around.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:14):**  And it's, it's not, it's not super expensive, I would say, you know, to look at the return  on investment, you know, for what it would be, you know, I would think I would say in  the ballpark of around, you know, $100, $150,000, turkey, labor intensive, you know, machinery,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:32):**  electrical, you know, we may tweak it, we may change it at a later date.  But you know, to have that, I mean, a combine costs more than that.  Putting up a grain bin costs more than that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:45):**  And those are things that that run very short spans of a year and don't offer a large return  on investment.  We're not too far away from pickups costing that much.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:40:54):**  Yeah, crazy.  I have to share a story about grits from this weekend.  So we made a big pot of grits with shrimp.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:02):**  And we're in Idaho, just so you guys know.  And there was probably eight 12 year olds there.  And they're like, what is this?  
**[0:41:08-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:08):**  What is this?  And then we made them eat it, maybe eat a big, healthy portion of it.  And we said, Okay, in the south, we eat on grits, this is like a staple for them.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:17):**  And there were, there were some that really liked it.  And there were some that just got that mouthfeel for the texture.  And it was it was just interesting to see the cultural changes of kids who have never  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:27):**  been exposed to grits and they're 12 years old.  And I was like, Okay, we need to start traveling with these kids more often because you guys  are missing out on really good food.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:35):**  Well, the thing that gets me is people in the Midwest try grits for the first time.  And they try five minute instant grits.  And those aren't real grits.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:42):**  No, no, no, it's like if you if you're making grits in less than 20 or 30 minutes, then  you didn't make real grits.  Do they even sell those five minute grits in North Carolina?  
**[0:41:52-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:41:52):**  Or do they they sell them just nobody buys them?  I think they sell them for the people that are on vacation from up north that are just  traveling through.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:00):**  I don't I don't think I don't think anybody here locally buys that stuff.  So have you made grits from your own corn yet?  Yeah, we've we've been making grits and cornmeal with our corn since 2017.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:13):**  We I would say 90% of our grits and cornmeal is the Jimmy red or bloody butcher variety.  We have bloody butcher.  And to me, it honestly is the best grits I've ever had in my life.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:25):**  Most people don't even know that the heirloom grits that are like, if you make real heirloom  grits on a stone meal, you're actually you're actually supposed to wash your grits.  Like people don't even know that that's a real thing.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:37):**  Like you put your grits in a bowl and run water in them and actually, if there's any  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you actually wash them before you cook them and a little bit of salt and pepper.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:47):**  I really don't even put butter in mine anymore.  I mean, you can but little salt and pepper in them things and it's good to go.  So you grow do you grow a lot of Jimmy red?  
**[0:42:56-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:42:56):**  We we grow bloody butcher we've actually we're going to start growing Jimmy red as well as  bloody butcher.  We have friends that grow Jimmy red.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:06):**  We're trying it out for the first time.  I don't think there's a major difference between the two the two varieties but we're going  to see we grow blue Hopi or blue Hoppy is how you should actually say it.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:17):**  Or Hopi Hopi is actually how you're supposed to say it.  But we're growing blue Hopi and Reed's yellow.  You got some colorful corn.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:24):**  Yeah, I planted some Jimmy red and I think I got like three good ears.  I'm not a corn farmer.  By any stretch of imagination.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:32):**  I grow grass for a living not corn.  But now we're looking forward to running some of it through our little hand crank mill and  and get some cornmeal out of it and and trying that.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:42):**  So that's cool.  That's really cool.  And I was going to ask you what the difference was between Jimmy red and bloody butcher.  
**[0:43:49-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:43:49):**  And I guess you you already covered that one for me.  I don't think it's much but if you look at the difference between like yellow number  two, if you look at the difference between like yellow number two corn, it's probably  
**[0:44:01-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:01):**  9% protein, you go to like Jimmy red or Reed's or Jimmy red or bloody butcher, you're up  about 12 to 13%.  And that blue corn, we've tested it before and had protein levels up to about 15%.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:14):**  So maybe you could eat some blue grits for breakfast instead of taking them muscle milk  drink before you go to the gym or something.  I don't know.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:22):**  But oh, yeah, blue grits.  That's where it's at.  That's the new new hotness new protein shake.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:27):**  I'm sure it tastes a lot better.  You heard it here first in six months, it'll be on Joe Rogan.  He'll be talking about eating grits, eating grits for the protein.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:36):**  Now just kidding.  So what what have we left out?  What have we left out that we're not covering today?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:43):**  Liz and Russell.  I don't know.  Do you have any other questions?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:46):**  Well, I not really Do you have anything you want to ask me or CK?  Yeah, you're gonna come up to Pratt.  I'm definitely gonna try.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:44:54):**  I've got a little trip up to Cheyenne, Wyoming scheduled right before that, but should be  back in in plenty of good time.  And I'm gonna try to make it up to Pratt and see what the see you great planes regeneration.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:07):**  That means our good friend Jessica nad she's involved.  So it's always great to see her.  And it'll be it'll be nice to see.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:14):**  Curious to see the turnout.  See what kind of turnout what kind of response you get in that community?  Yeah.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:19):**  Oh, and Jimmy Emmons is going to be there as well.  Oh, Jimmy's a rock star.  He's always Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:25):**  The only thing I can say, Brian is a regenerative grains also makes some pretty awesome bourbon.  Oh, really?  I'm still Are you really?  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:33):**  Mom, my birthday's in a few days.  So I told my husband that that's what you better get me.  Well, if he gets you a steel, I'll come back.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:40):**  Okay, we'll have to get a recipe from you or something.  So yeah, we, we we partnered with foothills distillery back in 2013.  And came out with the first bourbon in North Carolina since prohibition with heirloom grains.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:54):**  That's amazing.  And okay, we're not done yet.  You got to tell us all about that.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:45:59):**  Yeah.  So so we've we've been making moonshine and regenerative bourbon since I think our official  release on the bourbon was 14.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:46:10):**  And we've won, you know, the 1712 spirits is the brand and we've won gold at the San  Francisco World Spirit Awards several times we went up to New York City, it won silver  up there and then the pandemic hit so we didn't go back but I guess one of my dreams was to  
**[0:46:27-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:46:27):**  see a farmer owned distillery.  And that's one of our that's one of our projects for this fall that Liz has been helping me  with and Sarah that we're gonna have farmers reserve distillery startup this fall and we're  
**[0:46:41-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:46:41):**  making bourbon.  Yeah, we're making bourbon and brown sugar bourbon all different kinds of flavors of  alcohol.  
**[0:46:50-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:46:50):**  Brown sugar bourbon is the bacon of bourbon.  It's yeah, we're I made it I made it for I made it for Liz or Rick's retirement present  and I think we're going to call it the bourbon of legends.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:47:01):**  Can you ship?  Yeah, we do ship.  The 1712 spirits is actually in 36 states and we also sell online.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:47:11):**  And you know, so it's, it's something that you know, has been fun, but I want to see  something that's a little bit more farmer led as well.  And we're looking at the other reason other states and farmers are investing in it.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:47:24):**  We're, we're going to get it open and going and see how it goes.  That's like my dream is to have some type of event where it's focused on full health,  until we have a host bar.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:47:35):**  That's only regenerative drinks, you know, so we're also wanting to branch out into beer.  So why I call that the bacon of bourbon is because I'm a craft beer snob.  And that's all I would drink.  
**[0:47:50-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:47:50):**  And now all the sudden, I like bourbon too.  But yeah, if you come if you come to Pratt, one thing that anybody will tell you is I  never traveled to the speaking engagements without refreshments.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:04):**  So there will be samples.  Perfect.  For you, Brian.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:08):**  Just make sure you show up early because typically they go on.  Yeah, I'll have to settle for smelling it.  I haven't drank it over 16 years.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:18):**  Wow.  Good for you.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:21):**  But I hear about regenerative bourbon.  I love the story.  I mean, it's the world needs it.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:27):**  But you think about connecting, you know, communities.  This is how you do it.  Right.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:32):**  But isn't there a missing link in there?  Don't we need somewhere to malt grain in between the milling process and then brewing distilling  process?  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:40):**  We've we've taken care of that as well.  Okay, how?  He's the need, he fills it.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:46):**  So my farm actually works with Sierra Nevada Brewery, and two of the largest malt houses  on the East Coast.  So you're close to Falls River, and then that's where it's at?  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:48:58):**  Mills River.  Yeah.  Mills River.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:01):**  Yeah.  So you're from the original Sierra Nevada.  Yeah.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:05):**  So yeah, we, I don't even know how they got my name years ago, but they wanted to start  growing these weird barleys.  I started working with the Biltmore State on growing barley for their beer that they're  
**[0:49:17-0:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:17):**  selling.  We work with them quite a bit.  And I actually made a phone call to them today about also working with us on this milling  
**[0:49:25-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:25):**  idea.  And, you know, I guess being involved with them and growing some of these weird grains  just kind of put all the pieces together years ago for what we're doing now.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:35):**  And yeah, so we've got two of the largest malt houses in the East Coast within an hour  of me in any direction.  And we can take care of all of the malting.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:45):**  The facility I'm in right now, as you can see, we've got a seed cleaner, gravity table,  a mixing system, a bagging system.  I mean, it's, it's an entire place that we've built here that we we clean, we grind, we  
**[0:49:58-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:49:58):**  can do it all.  I remember doing some, I remember doing some research into what it would take to get like  a regenerative beer all from Kansas.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:07):**  And the only thing that we don't have is the malting is a place to get grains malted here  in the Midwest.  Everything I found was either on the East Coast or on the West Coast.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:17):**  So I think there are some malt houses there right now, but it all depends on cost effectiveness.  Right.  So, and it's, it's always cost effectiveness.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:27):**  And a lot of what, you know, it always comes down to, yeah, we can grind it for a cheap  price, but you got to have a hundred thousand bushels or, you know, some exorbitant quantity  of bushels and, you know, farmer can't necessarily always, always successfully, you know, market  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:42):**  that quantity himself.  We're doing it in 10,000 pound batches.  Okay.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:46):**  So that's, that's pretty small scale.  Russell is like, definitely like, if you challenge me and tell me I can't do it, I'm just going  to show you that we can.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:50:54):**  So definitely living up to, to, to that's amazing.  Yeah.  So if, if I call him and say, Hey, we need to make a, you know, regenerative beer all  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:51:02):**  over the country.  He's like, all right, well, let's do it then.  Who would call first?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:51:05):**  Yeah.  It snowballs.  Well, I think that's probably a pretty good place to end.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/34-Liz-Haney-and-Russell-Hedrick-Im-tired-of-people-farming-the-farmers-e18jhdj#t=0:51:11):**  We appreciate you guys joining us today and we left anything on the table.

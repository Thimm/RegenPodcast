**[0:00:35-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:00:35):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher here with another episode of Ranching Reboot, the podcast where  we discuss ideas outside of mainstream ranching with some of today's most innovative producers  of all things edible.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:00:56):**  With me as always is my best buddy and co-host CK.  But before we jump into today's episode, I want to thank all of our listeners for the  positive feedback and messages you've sent.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:05):**  It's very encouraging to both of us and we can't thank you enough.  Come join us in our private Facebook group, Ranching Reboot Paddock.  Today's guest is a self-styled grass nomad.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:15):**  She has made pilgrimages from North Carolina to California, New Mexico to Montana.  She's been trying to relearn the ancestral approach to land management, practicing thoughtful  grazing and observing soil health from horseback.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:29):**  Please welcome to the show, Ariel Greenwood.  How are you today, Ariel?  I'm doing good.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:33):**  I'm glad to be on the show with the both of you.  Awesome.  Thank you for having us.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:37):**  So grass nomads, and I follow you on Instagram and a half for some time and you guys bounce  back and forth between different parts of the country.  So where are you at now and where have you been this year?  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:49):**  Sure.  It's a rotation, you might say.  So maybe we should be grass semi-nomads because we do have a bit of a circuit, but right now  
**[0:01:58-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:01:58):**  we are in Northeastern New Mexico and we run a ranch for a cattle company that my man Sam  is a partner of.  So he's managing partner of the cattle company.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:11):**  It's a five person company based in Mexico.  And then Sam and I kind of operate as grass nomads LLC for our work here in New Mexico  and up in where we kind of spend about five months of the year in Montana and about seven  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:24):**  months in New Mexico.  That's what we've been doing the past couple of years.  And some of that could change in the future, but for now that's sort of our rotation works  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:32):**  pretty well.  So let's get into that a little bit.  Why do you do that?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:35):**  Do you bring the cattle back and forth or what?  Yeah, good question.  There's a few advantages to it.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:41):**  And like many things, some of it is part of a deliberate plan and some of it's just responding  to opportunities.  We don't bring cattle back and forth.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:02:51):**  We pretty much just bring ourselves and our horses and dogs and some books and things  like that.  Up in Montana, we work on a seasonal basis for Cayuse Livestock Company.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:03:02):**  We're not going to be Wyatt Donald, who some of your listeners might be familiar with.  And he's a really excellent manager of land and cattle and got connected to my partner  Sam through Zach Jones a few years back.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:03:17):**  And we actually spend a lot of our time on a ranch up there where Sam got his start many  years ago because Sam is also not born into ranching.  And up there we manage a couple of different ranches that are within about half an hour  
**[0:03:29-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:03:29):**  of each other.  And so that started off a few years ago with Wyatt connecting with Sam and then Wyatt got  a lease on another place just a few miles down the road.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:03:41):**  And around that time, Sam and I had thrown in our lot together, so to speak.  So it worked out pretty well for us each to have a ranch that we could run.  And that's yearling cattle up there.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:03:52):**  And so we worked together and each have our domains, so to speak, but help each other  out.  And that works out pretty well.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:04:00):**  So that was just an opportunity that came around that we were able to kind of grow with.  And I think we have a lot in common with Wyatt and with Kaius Livestock.  We care a lot about pretty rigorous grazing planning and record keeping.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:04:15):**  And we care a lot about trying to improve the health of the soil and the range through  thoughtful grazing and thoughtful impact.  We all really prioritize good stocking.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:04:24):**  We're trying to improve the livestock as a result of our handling them.  And I think that's good not just for the cattle themselves sort of in their own right, but  also for their use of the land and for our bottom line.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:04:37):**  And then our relationship here in New Mexico is that was a cattle company that Sam has  been a part of for about six years now.  And that works out pretty well.  
**[0:04:47-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:04:47):**  It's a creative arrangement to manage cattle, manage cows on a seasonal.  So it takes a lot of collaboration, communication, problem solving, a lot of things around how  do you hand off and share information with things.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:01):**  So we're still in the learning curve with that, but we think it's an arrangement that  has a lot of potential.  Well, let's talk about your background.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:09):**  So tell us where you came from and how you got where you are.  All right.  It's interesting.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:15):**  I get asked that question a lot and I always wonder like, what will my response be this  time?  Right.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah.  With every passing year, I gain more visibility of understanding myself and my decisions and  motivations and kind of what went into my being and probably forget some factors too.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:31):**  So I'll give you what I think is the most accurate answer to date, subject to change.  Well, on a more straightforward basis, I'm from North Carolina.  That's where I was born and raised and went to college.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:42):**  And then I started farming in my late teens.  I kind of found a local sort of sustainable vegetable and perennial plant farm through  community college I was going to and I started volunteering and that was in 2007.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:05:59):**  So I don't know when, you know, movies like farm ink and books like the omnivores dilemma,  but it was somewhere right around then.  So I was pretty swept up in the small family farming kind of movement.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:06:12):**  And I'm glad for that time.  I'm glad that there was a lot of momentum to kind of fall into sort of effortlessly  just by virtue of the work I was doing and the peers I was hanging out with.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:06:21):**  These days, I think there's a lot of healthy criticism of some of that move we can discuss  or not, but it was a good time for me.  And I went on to study both agroecology and psychology college and worked on farms during  
**[0:06:37-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:06:37):**  that time.  And then I moved out to California, got a job that didn't really pan out, but it was  a good sort of exposure to the wild and woolly world of semi-absentee land ownership and  
**[0:06:50-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:06:50):**  created livestock and kind of a crash that that job first job in California was kind  of a crash course.  The big disparity between intention and result and really a lot of my instincts that a lot  
**[0:07:03-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:07:03):**  of our barriers truly regenerative agriculture are not lack of knowledge, but a lot of times  it's the social systems that are not in place need innovation.  So after that, late 2014, I found a herd of cattle to work with, a gentleman had some  
**[0:07:21-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:07:21):**  cows on a nature preserve actually, and he had sort of a free lease arrangement in exchange  for managing the cattle in a way that was in line with what the nature preserve cared  about, which was trying to sustain the grasslands by pretty targeted grazing and keeping back  
**[0:07:39-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:07:39):**  some of the brush, et cetera, things that can be harmonized with animal performance,  but oftentimes are not.  So that was an interesting learning curve.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:07:51):**  I was out there for two and a half years and lived onsite, which was pretty sweet.  And I learned a ton about self-sufficiency and problem solving and working in bad weather  and bad conditions and sort of intuited my way into a lot of low stress stock handling  
**[0:08:08-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:08:08):**  principles just by virtue of having to move a small herd, but herd nonetheless of different  classes of cattle alone across this landscape.  And I used one or two strands of electric fence, GP poly pipe, all over the ranch above  
**[0:08:24-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:08:24):**  ground fortunately.  Very management intensive and not particularly efficient relative to our goals at the time,  but it was a good stepping stone for me.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:08:34):**  And from there, I was hired to manage the grazing for a ranch in Northern California  that had a few ranches and a grass fed program.  And I had kind of started my own grass fed label, fledgling label at the time, just to  
**[0:08:50-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:08:50):**  try to sort of pay myself for my work.  So I was able to build on and expand those skills and was taking formal courses in holistic  plant grazing and land monitoring and that kind of thing at the time too.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:05):**  So that was sort of my entry into cattle and livestock and land and management on a larger  scale.  That's great.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:15):**  I really liked that line of crash course, disparity with tension and resistance.  It's a real thing.  So yeah.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:23):**  So what are some of the other things that have really influenced you?  What are some of the other, like what are some of the specific resources that have been  good resources that you talk about?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:32):**  Sure.  Oh, well, podcasts.  And I'm not just saying that because we're making one right now.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:39):**  I started listening to podcasts in my late teens when I was working on that farm.  And I just think it's such an incredible way to encounter ideas that might be challenging  or threatening in a way that is low stakes and where we can really think about them.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:09:54):**  And a big part of what my appetite for working with livestock on rangeland was just listening  to interviews with farmers and ranchers and Alan Savory back in the day.  And I was studying, taking these ecology courses at the time.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:10:11):**  And so a lot of that stuff sort of checked out the relationship between ruminants and  prairie ecosystems.  So I think we are in a sort of golden age of learning and sharing because of how many  
**[0:10:26-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:10:26):**  new voices can be heard and how many new ways we can encounter information.  That sounds really kind of cliche.  I'm sure people started saying that about the worldwide web back in the late 80s, early  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:10:37):**  90s.  But I think podcasts in particular, because you can listen to them while you're working  or you're listening to your conversation.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:10:42):**  Driving, living in a tractor, right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:10:47):**  And it's a way of taking in information that for me is I'm more likely to remember because  I have all these other sensory reinforcement.  I've been riding around the ranch and come to a particular spot and just a fact or a  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:00):**  bit of sort of semantic knowledge will pop into my head.  And I realized this because I was listening to a particular podcast when I was last covering  that fence or something.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:08):**  So that's one and that's an easy one.  Another one that has been really valuable to me has been online groups, online Facebook  group.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:18):**  And I started to get on the internet when I was in my, like, I think I was eight years  old and so I was an early adopter.  That was in the late, late night, relatively early adopter and found my way by way of like  
**[0:11:30-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:30):**  animal husbandry forums, you know, horse forums, like hermit crab forums and stuff.  So for me, a big part of my development just as a human, but certainly as a grazer ranch  manager is the ability to seek out specific information, pose questions, perhaps to total  
**[0:11:47-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:47):**  strangers, but people who are almost certainly going to know more than I do.  You know, if they're replying, it means they have something to say and the quality of that  information might not be great, but it's just a good way of casting a wide net.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:11:59):**  You know, there's a, for example, there's a stockmanship and ranch roping group on Facebook  and a regular member of that group is Steve Cody, who is, you know, a stockmanship expert  and literally wrote the book on low stress stockhand.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:12:11):**  So you know, we shouldn't all rush on there and inundate just Steve with our questions,  but it's a pretty cool thing that someone who is using the search bar first, please.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:12:21):**  Absolutely.  Practice good form at a time.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:12:25):**  I just feel really fortunate to be in an age where, yeah, where there is a search function  and where absolute experts care so much about what they do, that they make their knowledge  available to other people.

And I've had just some mentors along the way, and I would say I have not taken advantage.  I mean, I hate to say take advantage, but I have not gleaned as much from those mentors  
**[0:12:53-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:12:53):**  as I could have if I'd been more thoughtful about it.  But I, you know, people in California like Spencer Smith and Kent Reeves and Richard  King and Joe Morris, and just with sort of introduction to like holistic management,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:13:09):**  Aaron Lusich, Guido Frisini, lots of people who just made their time and minds available  to me.  That's another thing.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:13:20):**  And then, you know, you'll notice that I didn't mention any female names just then.  And that's because I have not until recently had a lot of sort of female peers and mentors  in ranching, but the women in ranching group, which is now, you know, hosted by Western  
**[0:13:36-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:13:36):**  Landowners Association.  That, you know, I once heard it said that, I'm probably going to bastardize this quote,  but it was something along the lines of...  
**[0:13:46-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:13:46):**  We have Beth scheduled next month.  I'm trying to get Aaron, so if you can poke Aaron too.  Yeah, we have Beth scheduled next month to record.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:13:57):**  So looking forward to that.  Yeah, excellent.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:14:01):**  I heard this expression once that was something, it was a woman and it might've just been a  tweet or something, but she said something along the lines of, it was in reference to  some big idea, some company she was starting her product or whatever.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:14:13):**  And she said that the men she met told her why it wouldn't work.  And the women she met told her or asked her how they could help.  And I don't mean that as any particular job against men so much as I think that there's  
**[0:14:29-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:14:29):**  a particular way that women assist in mentor that is different from how men often do.  We need both, but there's so much to be said for just being an advocate and a cheerleader  because any individual human's ability to become their best self, to rise to the challenge,  
**[0:14:50-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:14:50):**  to problem solve, to think independently and autonomously, we all have that capacity, but  for many of us, and I think especially women, we've been so trained to distrust ourselves  to have imposter syndrome.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:15:01):**  So not even try something to think we need to ask all the experts first.  And that's just an instinct that we have.  And so I've been really thankful for so many of my female friends who have just blown that  
**[0:15:12-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:15:12):**  out of the water.  You know, like Brittany Cole, but she's a really good friend of mine.  And she's an example of someone who just has done so much self work in addition to spending  
**[0:15:21-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:15:21):**  years in the field and her practice of contract raising that she just, when you're around  her, you just feel energized and reminded of your own capacity and to be yourself because  she's much herself.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:15:34):**  So that's a resource that I think is undervalued in ranching, especially ranching.  That's a little bit against the grain, but I think is just someone to say, you know what,  you can do this, I'm here to help, but you can do this is that's really impactful.  
**[0:15:50-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:15:50):**  And I mean, there's so many people I get specifically and that I would like to, but that would take  most of our time.  I think once we kind of get toward the end of what we already have scheduled and planned  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:01):**  out we're definitely going to want Brittany Cole Bush.  So she might listen to this.  So Brittany, email us and let's set something up.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:09):**  We don't hear from you.  You can get her to sit still long enough.  That's the challenge with folks like her.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:17):**  I'm trying to, I mean, I should also to give absolute credit where do, you know, when I  met my partner, Sam I met him because the ranch that I was working for had a land base  and was looking for potentially for a manager for it.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:34):**  It was a larger piece with more cattle and far away from where I was.  And Kelly Mulville at Piscinus Ranch suggested that I, or I guess I wrote sort of a job description  and forwarded it to Kelly and asked him to share this with my be interested.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:48):**  And he sent it to George Witten and a lot of your listeners will know George Witten  and then George Witten sent it to Sam and Sam and I struck up just sort of a professional  correspondence for a while.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:16:59):**  And that was how we got connected.  And so I didn't manage to hire him, but I, you know, we did end up kind of throwing in  our lot together.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:17:08):**  And at the time I was, you know, I'd been working with cattle pretty independently for  a few years at that point.  And I grew up riding horses casually.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:17:17):**  So I was comfortable with some of those things, but to go from working on small, somewhat  productive California ranches you know, working at sort of a boutique scale compared to a  lot of places to then working on a, you know, at that time we were on a hundred thousand  
**[0:17:35-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:17:35):**  acre lease on a Apache reservation, you know, where we manage horseback and it takes forever  to get anywhere and you're on rangeland, you know, big pastures, similar area.  And that was for me, it was a huge like punch to the gut, like in terms of ego check and  
**[0:17:54-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:17:54):**  I knew it would be difficult, but it was more difficult than I thought it would be just  to ostensibly have skills in a domain and then get there and not feel very useful.  But having come through it with a really good partner who has taught me so much about, you  
**[0:18:08-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:18:08):**  know, starting horses and working with dogs and all these things that I had a little bit  of feel for, but not nothing to the degree that I now use those skills.  Now that was a really challenging time.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:18:19):**  It was kind of like running the gauntlet, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I think agriculture is so tricky because there's a lot of sort of how to put it.  There's a lot of norms and resources that are not in place in agriculture for a lot  
**[0:18:34-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:18:34):**  of different reasons that many other industries have.  And so to step out and grow and find opportunities for yourself requires a lot of putting your  ego on the line and a lot of falling on your face, oftentimes literally.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:18:49):**  And I don't want it to be that way.  That'll always be the case for, to some extent, just by the nature of the work.  But I think it's really good for us to try to work with the realities we have now also  
**[0:19:00-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:00):**  trying to innovate and brainstorm on what ways can we make this more accessible to more  people who want to do the work and who are committed, but come from different backgrounds  that don't have the skillset, but have the passion.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:10):**  Because we just need more entry ways to the work we need to put on the ground.  And that's why this show exists.  Right.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:18):**  So, right.  And I have, I have noticed some of our great like grazers or that have a holistic approach.  They're actual, when they're seeking employees now, they're like, we don't care if you don't  
**[0:19:29-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:29):**  have the skillset, you have to have the right mindset and then we can give you the skills.  And that's almost more valuable for them to have someone who has the passion and drive  to learn than someone who, who maybe has a skillset, but not, not the right mindset because  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:43):**  you can't, you can't get over that hurdle of someone who's not going to understand why  you do what you do.  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:19:49):**  And I mean, my biggest I've historically been my own worst enemy in my growth in agriculture,  just because I, through, through how I was raised or my own making or, you know, obviously  always some combination of both, but I'm the kind of person who like, I want to do it right  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:07):**  the first time and I get really down on myself.  I don't know how and, and, you know, it's hard for me to just jump in if I don't understand  what the goal is.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:14):**  I want to know the whole picture first.  And a lot of that stuff, you just have to kind of set aside because it just doesn't  work to have things there's there's, you know, on the one hand, we can do a lot better to  
**[0:20:26-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:26):**  train and initiate employees and develop them in a way that's thoughtful and responsible  and safe.  And at the same time, there's just no manual that you can read to be fully prepared for  
**[0:20:34-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:34):**  everything.  And a lot of times, as you're saying, people who have people who have a little bit of experience  with something it's like Dunning Kruger syndrome, right?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:45):**  Like they, they think they don't know what they don't know.  And so they ended up causing a lot of wrecks and, you know, we're all entitled to our mistakes,  like they're bound to happen, but if you're causing expensive wrecks on someone else's  
**[0:20:58-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:20:58):**  dime, then that's of course pretty challenging.  So I think, and there's a point where you have to check your ego at the door and realize  that there's things you don't know, and admit that you failed or admit, admit that you don't  
**[0:21:11-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:21:11):**  know and then use some of these resources that you've talked about dealing that stockmanship  forum, you know, or we're listening to some podcasts, you know, Ariel, I gotta say, you  are probably one of the first 100 or 200 people that I found and followed on Instagram when  
**[0:21:27-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:21:27):**  I started up my Instagram account.  And it has been very enjoyable watching your journey for the last six or seven years.  And your post as, as you've grown and developed.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:21:39):**  So you talked about doing some daily moves and running reels and moving poly pipe in  California and that's an operation that I am intimately familiar with.  So now that's a big change to what you're doing now, managing much larger herds on a  
**[0:21:54-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:21:54):**  much faster landscape with horses and dogs.  So let's talk about some grazing management and soil health from horseback.  What are you doing to move the needle?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:22:06):**  Good question.  Well, I mean, the biggest outstanding question is are we moving needle because all things  equal really good management can do that.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:22:14):**  But when we are, you know, we, we started this, this particular lease at the start of  the year, we moved all the cows and equipment and horses and whatnot from, from the aforementioned  Apache reservation just a little over a year ago and came into a land base that, um, I  
**[0:22:31-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:22:31):**  think historically has been managed pretty well, probably pretty conservatively.  So minimize damage in terms of, I think it had been stocked pretty much set stock, but  grayed lightly, but probably over graze the last few years.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:22:45):**  And especially in that transition period when owners knew they would be leasing it out,  but they still had their own cattle there.  Um, as we all know, sometimes it's the last little marginal period of time that can have  
**[0:22:55-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:22:55):**  a big impact for better for worse.  So, um, grass is really short right now and we de-stocked, um, pretty significantly as  much as we felt like the company could withstand.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:23:07):**  Um, and basically as soon as Sam and I got back here, we started to craft grazing plans  that took into account, um, the use from the prior grazing seat, prior dormant season.  Um, and just sort of, uh, tried to project ahead factoring in what, like how well we  
**[0:23:28-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:23:28):**  left it in the past.  And, um, that's kind of a clunky way of saying that, but a big factor here on this particular  ranch is we have that, um, thousands of antelope and herds of up to a thousand elk.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:23:41):**  Um, so probably well over a thousand elk cause there's different.  So that makes it pretty challenging to both plan for plant recovery and plan for a stockpile.  So our attitude is kind of had to be one of let's just treat the elk and the antelope  
**[0:23:57-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:23:57):**  as, as just a fact of life, you know, which means what we do with the cattle really has  to be on point.  Um, so, you know, we've, we've tried to plan it to where we're, we're grazing dormant grass  
**[0:24:11-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:24:11):**  as late into spring, as close to summer as possible.  Ideally, you know, in my ideal world, when it's really hard to get here, but I would  love to be grazing, effectively grazing, like always half a year's worth of grass ahead  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:24:24):**  of me.  But to get there takes really careful management and really managing those margins incrementally  bit by bit.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:24:31):**  And it's, it's just getting, it's, it's a game of inches really.  Um, and so we we've planned on trigger dates for when we might have to de-stock more if  we don't get sufficient snow or rainfall.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:24:44):**  Um, you know, ideally we wouldn't be relying on spring growth at all, but I think just  with the circumstances, we'll probably have to be grazing.  I mean, cattle are always going to graze spring growth if it's during the pasture, but, um,  
**[0:24:55-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:24:55):**  we're probably going to have to be utilizing some of that as part of for, you know, the  forage they're intaking.  Um, and just hope that over time we can build it, build things back up incrementally and  
**[0:25:05-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:25:05):**  always have more grass than we have cattle.  Um, right now we have cattle pretty scattered on this ranch and we brought back, um, someone  who's worked with us in the past and managed cattle with us in the past, who's pretty familiar  
**[0:25:19-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:25:19):**  both with, um, our sort of style and ethos of management and our way of working with  animals and we get along really well.  And so he kind of works on another part of the ranch and we work on another.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:25:29):**  Um, so we've had to add in personnel just to manage, just because we've had to scatter  cattle across the ranch more, um, because of that drought situation.  And, um, there's a lot of things that we're doing though, just as a matter of course.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:25:43):**  Um, so we're trying to locate and place cattle in pastures so that we'll utilize grass that  they otherwise were less likely to.  And we're doing that through a mix of water development, through, uh, fence development.

That's to be pretty compatible with the significant elk presence.  Um, just hurting and trying to get cattle responsive and well-trained and comfortable  
**[0:26:05-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:05):**  moving out, you know, um, comfortable leaving and going out to graze and placement of, um,  selfing supplements.  So predominantly blocks and especially lick tubs.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:16):**  Um, those around, uh, adjust grazing distribution a little bit.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:22):**  And that comes more in the form of, you know, we'll put a tub out and once it's, you know,  those things weigh two 53 pounds.  So once it's down enough, it can pick up and move it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:31):**  But yeah, that's, those are kind of our tools right now.  Um, and we're using all of them.  We're putting in about eight miles of high tensile fence right now.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:39):**  After that currently is 27,000 acres and cattle tend to just kind of pull up in the very bottom  areas and do that.  So, um, and we have cattle that we purchased this spring.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:26:50):**  The company purchased the spring because we needed to expand the herd.  And some of those are taking a long time to integrate sort of into our program until,  you know, they can bunch up and gather and move calmly.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:00):**  But it is really fun seeing them change.  It really is often just sort of a few cows who've who knows what happened to them in  the past, but the rest are pretty open to, to learn changing and settling in.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:11):**  And yeah, we, um, right now we have cattle kind of where they're going to be for, um,  the next probably six weeks or so at least, um, because it is dormant season.  But, um, we, we took a lot of, a lot of work getting, coming back from Montana, getting  
**[0:27:26-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:26):**  everyone where they needed to be for weaning and pregging, having these different groups  in calves and cows and bulls and shipping everyone.  Um, so come spring, we'll start really moving cattle around, not just within pastures as  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:38):**  we're doing now, but into new pastures.  And, and it's a big ranch.  We work mostly horseback with, with dogs, like you said, and we try to think of our,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:47):**  our dogs, especially as being a pretty critical tool for stockmanship and they can make your  cattle worse or they can make them better.  Um, so we're trying to really be thoughtful about how we're doing that as we develop our  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:27:56):**  dogs, develop our horses.  Awesome.  So briefly touched on herding.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:01):**  You said something about, you know, herding, we got into a little rabbit trail about how  to move cattle around to different parts of the pasture by moving their supplemental protein  and whatnot.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:11):**  Um, you mentioned herding.  So are you guys out there on horseback doing any, doing any herding and trying to place  cattle or any kind of in herding techniques like Glen Elzinga talks about instinctive  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:22):**  migration grazing that Bob Kenford and Ricky Cremins are pretty high on?  To an extent.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:28):**  Um, I think that we're doing exactly what Bob instructs and I love to learn more from  him.  I've, I've watched his DVD and there's, there's, I think there's probably a lot to it that  
**[0:28:38-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:38):**  would just need to be experienced firsthand.  Um, but in terms of the principles behind that, um, yeah, I mean, we, our strategy right  now for cattle, we want to move around within pastures is, um, we'll typically set out a  
**[0:28:53-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:28:53):**  little, a lick tub, for example, um, ahead of time, and then we'll gather cattle up,  whether at a water point or make sure they have a really good drink before we move them  so that they're not just going to leave to go to water as soon as they're placed.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:29:06):**  So we're usually going out late morning, um, so that everybody's had a drink if they want  it or can get a drink and be comfortable if we take them to water.  And then we just try to get them gathered and pointed where we want them and, um, try  
**[0:29:19-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:29:19):**  to be pretty thoughtful about, um, you know, I have no trouble using, um, you know, I have  no trouble using, um, pretty good pressure force when appropriate with cattle, but I  think it's, it's a particularly important stage how they're handled when you're taking  
**[0:29:31-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:29:31):**  them to where you want them to stay.  So, um, so we'll get them gathered up and, um, take them sometimes up to a few miles,  um, often a little bit higher elevation.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:29:43):**  Um, and we try to take them a trail that they're comfortable taking, not, which isn't always  going to be, you know, the straightest route, but take, be mindful of the contours that  they're traveling and how they might kind of fall off a hill down back down to the bottom.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:29:56):**  And, um, and I think that's, that's been helping and we need to do it more.  And of course that in conjunction with the fence we're building will be extra effective,  but it helps the cows that are already adjusted and it really helps the cattle that aren't  
**[0:30:09-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:30:09):**  quite with the program yet.  Um, but then, so we'll take them to a place where we've got some supplements set up and  then we just try to slow them down and let them start to graze, you know, find that supplement  
**[0:30:21-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:30:21):**  and then wander off and start to graze and, um, maybe even bed down if they're to that  point or if they've been grazing enough and we'll often dismount and just kind of settle  in with them for 20 or 30 minutes.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:30:32):**  And then we leave and, you know, we're doing that about once a week right now.  Um, we might have to start doing it more.  Um, but that seems to be, it's working well enough to justify the time.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:30:43):**  And fundamentally we need to be utilizing some of the grass that historically has gone  underutilized just by pastures being so huge or limited water understocked.  And there's lots to learn.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:30:54):**  I feel like I learned something new about, you know, angles and techniques and movements  and gestures and, and my dog, my  Body posture and approach angles and yeah.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:05):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the last time I tried something new and it kind of worked and, um, there's aspects  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:10):**  of it that didn't work.  And I was dealing with some cows that were wanting to leave as soon as they saw me and  take others with them.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:17):**  And I couldn't quite, I didn't have the clearance and the terrain to get up ahead of them.  And I didn't just want to send my dog cause she's still a little too fresh.  And so there's all these factors where it's like, here's the principle and the theory.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:29):**  Um, and of course people make it look really easy, you know, when they're working with  two year old doggies in a, you know, in a corral, but take it out into the real world  and, and it's, that's where it matters most.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:42):**  And that's where it's often the least obvious.  Um, but I'm, I'm really glad to that Sam and our other guy, Jeff, are, we're all kind of  of the same mind and committed to the same things.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:31:52):**  And the most frustrating thing is when you're trying to do something and you have people  along who, who for whom it's just an outing and don't really think about how much their  actions are affecting the cattle.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:02):**  And, um, and frankly, you know, a lot of the things we do, you might not see a difference  in the cattle and how they behave unless you're really looking for it.  You know, we're trying to find these little leverage points that we can manipulate to  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:15):**  get the results that we want in the cattle and to make their lives easier and to make  our lives easier.  And thus the range easier.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:21):**  Anyone who's not looking for it is just going to say, I don't think it makes a difference.  You know, look, that cow's fine.  They're moving fine, you know, but the more I do it, the more I notice the tension behind  
**[0:32:32-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:32):**  the animal's eye or the flick of their tail or the angle of their head and their ear.  And you know how tight their back muscles are, and there's so many things, you know,  the more you look, the more there is to see, but it takes really looking and assuming we  
**[0:32:44-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:44):**  don't quite know what we're seeing as we're looking.  You just have to slow down and stop and look and listen to what the animal is really trying  to tell you.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:32:54):**  I think so.  We totally underestimate cattle too.  I mean, I think that, you know, I don't have any interest in trying to qualify, qualify  
**[0:33:01-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:01):**  or quantify how intelligent or not they are, but the reality is that there's just so much  more to them as a species than we often recognize.  And I think we, because they're so domesticated, we think that that's limited their range of  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:14):**  complexity.  And I think if anything, that's expanded it because we've left our thumbprint on them.  So why would we not want to develop and deepen that relationship?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:22):**  I totally agree.  So shifting gears a little bit, we got to backtrack.  I'll lead you down many rabbit trails and some badger holes.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:34):**  We love rabbit trails.  That's fine.  If we never get where we're going, it's just a good reason to have you back.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:40):**  There you go.  So you're in Northeastern New Mexico and you know, we're recording this and it's not going  to come out until probably about the end of March, I think is what the, or end of February  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:52):**  at least is what the release schedule is.  Not March.  I don't know what I was thinking.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:33:56):**  Yeah.  So literally last night I was, I was talking to a gentleman that's offering me a herd of  cows and he's south of you in, I guess it would be Southeast New Mexico, right along  
**[0:34:08-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:34:08):**  the Texas line.  And I know that whole country is droughted out and I don't, it's a horrible situation.  And I, and I feel like that drought's kind of not going to go away at any time.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:34:19):**  So let's talk about why this eight miles of hot wire and water development is important  for the impending drought.  Well we're in the drought now, but I hear your point.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:34:29):**  I mean, this is a landscape that's prone to it.  And you, some people would say it's a landscape that is just permanently in drought because  of how degraded it is, you know, in terms of the, the soil cover, the plant community  
**[0:34:41-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:34:41):**  and the ability to make good with the rain we get, we're set back pretty far, I think.  I think it's paradoxical, but the, the less grass we have, the more we have to manage  it.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:34:53):**  And it's in the dormant season, it's interesting because, you know, there's little attitudes  sometimes, like I've often heard it said, in some sort of holistic management circles,  I think incorrectly or in a way that's misunderstood that you can't over graze a dormant plant.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:35:09):**  I think that's true from the perspective of you can't cause a plant to shed roots the  way that you can in the active growing season, if my plant physiology understanding is correct,  but structurally speaking that, that residual plant really, really matters.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:35:27):**  And there's a point at which when we get so short in a landscape that can be really hot,  extremely windy, really heavy rain events that when the, not only does the ground not  have cover, but there's just not enough height of stubble to, to slow down the wind, to slow  
**[0:35:47-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:35:47):**  down the water, to collect snow, that you can just end up in a downward spiral that's  hard to pull your nose back out of.  And I haven't been grazing long enough in New Mexico to know exactly what that point  
**[0:35:59-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:35:59):**  is, but looking around a lot of these ranches in person, this ranch are right up against  it or worse.  So the funny thing about scale though, is like, you know, if you've got a pasture that's  
**[0:36:10-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:36:10):**  27,000 acres in the case of this one, we're splitting up, you know, if 10% of that pasture  is looking really bad and needs, or is headed that direction, that's 2,700 acres.  That's bigger than a lot of people's ranches.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:36:25):**  Granted this land is not that productive, but that's why the margins really, really  matter.  And in drought years, if you're leaving half inch behind versus a eighth of an inch, that  
**[0:36:37-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:36:37):**  really matters, you know?  And I think there's this tendency that humans do in our minds where a situation seems bad  and so we just want to look away.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:36:46):**  We just want to throw up our hands and get our drought payment and say, there's nothing  more I can do.  But we need to be doing the opposite.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:36:53):**  The harder a situation is, the closer we need to be looking.  And it's hard to look at rangeland that's degraded, that's battered, whether from cattle  or elk or historic drought or any combination.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:37:03):**  Like personally, I feel it on my skin.  Like if a land looks like it is hurting, it hurts me physically.  And I think that's the case for, you know, I think that's been the case for, you know,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:37:14):**  indigenous land stewards for millennia.  And I think that's the case for a lot of ranchers and grazers also, where we begin to feel  with a landscape.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:37:22):**  And I guess where water and fence and placement comes in is speaking strictly from the perspective  of the structure of the plants, not talking about TDN or animal, you know, if they're  getting enough fill or anything like that, speaking strictly of how the animal's interacting

If we can get them to spend more time grazing and impacting parts of the ranch that can  take that impact and still sustain their nutrition and keep them off of areas that are already  
**[0:37:50-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:37:50):**  just beat down and grazed down, then we're distributing impact in a way that is going  to salvage some of the areas that are really hurting.  Especially considering areas that elk like to come in and hang out are often those really  
**[0:38:02-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:02):**  beat down areas.  So it's like the elk are already going to beat that up, you know, and we're humans,  we're managing domestic cattle that we've manipulated over time.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:12):**  It's our job to take responsibility for our impact on landscape.  The wildlife is to do what it's going to do.  And that's, it's just an interesting psychological phenomenon that I'm paying attention to  
**[0:38:23-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:23):**  more and more where the worse the situation is, the less we want to acknowledge it.  Right.  Reverse that and support each other in looking closely at what could be a train wreck, then  
**[0:38:33-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:33):**  we'll be able to make the marginal incremental decisions that have exponential, the potential  to have exponential change.  Right.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:42):**  I don't know if that really answered your question, but I think, I think that's, I mean,  to me, it makes a lot of sense because I think we've trained ourselves to have a coping mechanism  that fosters like destruction, like even like interpersonal life.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:38:57):**  And I think about like, you don't, you shouldn't run away from this.  You should see this as an opportunity to like, how can I not destroy this?  And how can I improve this?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:39:05):**  I mean, if you get 10% increase of change, 2,700 acres, that's huge.  Like that's, that's the goal, right?  So that's, that's what, I mean, we should put in context.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:39:14):**  That's what we're working towards.  Yeah.  And, and I think the, just the stock day or animal per acre, animal day per acre concept  
**[0:39:21-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:39:21):**  is so critical for that.  And a lot of people in arid or semi-arid rangeland don't think about, don't think in that way,  because I think the thought is, well, you're running so few animals per acre anyway, so  
**[0:39:35-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:39:35):**  few animals per, per hundred acres anyway, then why think down to the decimal point?  But like, no, that's, that's why we do it.  Montana is a lot more forgiving in many ways because where we are there is higher rainfall  
**[0:39:49-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:39:49):**  and it's a short, but pretty intense growing season.  And those ranches have been the larger one in particular, Wyatt, when he was running  cattle there before he started to contract with, with other people with us, he was able  
**[0:40:02-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:40:02):**  to slowly build up the reserve of residual grass there.  And that has made all the difference.  So we're to the point now, especially on the larger ranch and increasingly smaller ranch  
**[0:40:16-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:40:16):**  that I kind of run where when we turn cattle out, they're able to eat dormant feed alongside  the washing stuff.  And when they're, you know, when you have in some cases, 1500 head of 700 pound yearlings  
**[0:40:29-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:40:29):**  turning out in one herd, it's really important to have just that cushion underneath their,  their hooves, especially on places that have higher clay.  And that's the difference between, you know, that's why we all say, well, are cattle good  
**[0:40:43-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:40:43):**  or bad?  It depends just like anything.  And I think that I like talking about the mechanical piece of animal impact because  
**[0:40:51-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:40:51):**  that, you know, you can be grazing and in a way where you have long, you know, high  intensity, but long rest periods and still be setting your rangeland back.  If a manager is not paying attention to what the land is like that they're coming on and  
**[0:41:07-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:41:07):**  what they're leaving for the next go.  And you're, you're, you're touched on something that a couple of our previous guests that  we've discussed about, you know, pugging and compaction from herd effect.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:41:20):**  And some of the things that we've been hearing and what I'm starting to come to understand  is the more loamy and sandy your soil is, the less compaction is an issue.  And the faster you can drive the carbon pump, the higher clay you have, the more sensitive  
**[0:41:35-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:41:35):**  you need to be about herd effect and stock density when you do have moisture to avoid  a pugging or compaction situation like that.  That checks out with me and my experience, absolutely great.  
**[0:41:47-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:41:47):**  California in that ranch in Montana, it's it, those kind of soils, they remember they  have a long memory.  So if you, if you mess it up, yeah, they recover, especially if they have high rainfall, but  
**[0:42:00-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:42:00):**  it might be, you might be seeing taproot or daniels for the next three years in places  that get high impact.  And for me, I don't have any problem with the small percentage of a ranch, you know,  
**[0:42:11-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:42:11):**  around water points or critical corridors having just being a little weedy, if it means  that that enables you to manage the whole, the majority more effectively, but those areas  are really instructive.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:42:23):**  And and I think, I also think, I mean, this is a tough pill to swallow, but I think those  of us in these sort of ambitious plant grazing communities need to be able to acknowledge  that some ranches, if our goal is to rehabilitate degraded rangeland or pasture, or our goal  
**[0:42:42-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:42:42):**  is to get, you know, more productivity or more diversity or both, whatever our goal  might be, the best way to get to that goal might mean not grazing a ranch every year  or not grazing a part of it every year.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:42:55):**  You know, we have our mind linked to this production cycle that is on an annual basis  and somehow resets every 12 months.  And that's just not the reality in nature.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:43:05):**  The cycles in nature can be much longer.  And economically, that can be really challenging.  But if we are insisting that we graze a ranch or a pasture every single year or more than  
**[0:43:18-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:43:18):**  once a year, but our monitoring feedback is telling us it's not advancing where we think  it should be in terms of ecologically or its productivity, then we need to think about  rest as a critical tool, because it's not always an appropriate tool, but sometimes  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:43:35):**  it is.  And I think we're so wary of overrest that we forget to use it on the times when it is  an important tool.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:43:42):**  And I think that timing of the rest and recovery, you know, in more brittle environments, obviously  I'm not in as brittle environment as you are there in New Mexico, but you know, it's still  fairly brittle here with variability of rainfall and dryness generally.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:43:58):**  I think that, you know, in sandy, brittle soils, you know, the management is so much  more critical because, you know, once that needle starts to move, it just starts going  and it goes fast.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:44:10):**  You have to be able to find those keys to move the needle and the variability of rain  from where you are to where I am, I think you're exactly right that, you know, we've  got tied into this annual production paradigm that, you know, these things happen every  
**[0:44:25-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:44:25):**  year.  And I was just thinking that, you know, like in 2019, I was really wet and I was really  cool or way high on rainfall.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:44:34):**  The grass was all washy.  Places where I had good stockpile from previous year, cattle did okay, but where I was all  on new growth and it was really washy, they were lacking for the dry matter and some of  
**[0:44:46-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:44:46):**  them actually went backwards.  The yearlings didn't gain very well.  So yeah, we have to look at these things and say, well, okay, that's why this happened.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:44:55):**  Yeah.  It was a wreck that the yearlings didn't, you know, barely gain three quarters of a  pound a day for 120 days.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:45:00):**  I mean, that was almost a catastrophe, but you know, looking back now we know why that  happened and you know, we can talk about it and we can learn some other ways to mitigate  that.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:45:10):**  And we come up with strategies so it doesn't happen again.  Yeah.  Something Spencer Smith mentioned to me a few years ago, it was always stuck with me.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:45:20):**  When he's teaching people holistic plant grazing, he encourages them to have a goal every year  for each pasture.  And I think that's really thoughtful and the smaller ranch we run in Montana has really  
**[0:45:33-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:45:33):**  kicked me in the butt in that respect and really forced me to consider it pasture by  pasture because the land is so variable there in terms of its historic use that you'll have  a pasture that is just degraded and just covered with a few weeds and then running the other  
**[0:45:47-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:45:47):**  side of the fence line is something very different.  And I haven't done this yet, but I would love to get to the point where I could rest a meaningful  percentage of a ranch every year, even if it means overgrazing another percentage.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:46:02):**  I don't know how much that would be depending on how pastures are laid out partially, but  even if it means in the short term overgrazing part of the ranch causing temporary damage,  you might say, to get enough up under our feet on that other part.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:46:18):**  Then when we come back, we're on an upward positive trend with just material we can work  with.  The other thing though is I think a really important part or a really useful part of  
**[0:46:27-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:46:27):**  our approach to management is, and it's nothing uncommon, it's I think pretty common, but  just trying to graze every pasture differently every year to whatever extent we can.  Of course, there's some pastures it's like you're going to receive cattle and you're  
**[0:46:40-0:46:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:46:40):**  going to turn out and they're going to be there after you wean or whatever the case  may be.  But to whatever wiggle room we have, because if we're just trying to get more diverse expression  
**[0:46:52-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:46:52):**  of different plant species, which isn't always the goal, but I think is a valuable direction  to go in general, there are some plant species that will not express unless they're in a  really short, grazed down, pretty hard pasture.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:47:05):**  And then there's others that won't express unless they have sufficient litter and residual.  I realize that those are two different terms, litter and residual, and interchangeably we  can go down that rabbit trail if we want to.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:47:17):**  There's plenty to say about that matter.  There's a website, I think it's the Prairie Ecologist, and he's got some really good resources  for anyone who wants to explain to a potential landowner that they might want to lease from  
**[0:47:33-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:47:33):**  a work with some of the principles of plant grazing without using, it doesn't really use  any of the jargon that we're familiar with, but in terms of manipulating that variability,  lingering behind and accelerating, rest recovery, getting these different impacts for different  
**[0:47:51-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:47:51):**  reasons and how the ecosystem in general tends to respond.  And somewhere more, I think in the Midwest, so it's not applicable to every landscape,  but it's pretty useful.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:48:00):**  A term we've been throwing around lately, might've actually coined it here on the podcast,  is contextually appropriate management.  And I'm going to steal the Pareto principle here and say that 80% of what we do drives  
**[0:48:17-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:48:17):**  20%, or 20% of what we do gives us 80% of the results.  And I think we can almost kind of apply that to that idea of contextually appropriate management,  because that means something completely different for me than it does for you in Mexico.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:48:33):**  And it has a different meaning when you go to Montana.  Yep.  And I would say taking that a step further, not just in the nuts and bolts of grazing  
**[0:48:43-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:48:43):**  and our production plan, but I've been thinking a lot how in our discussion and language about  not just plan grazing, but holistic plan grazing and holistic management, how can we use contextually  appropriate language to describe that?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:48:59):**  And it's something I've been thinking about.  I've been talking to Delene Atcity, who's on the HMI board along with myself and who  runs, I think it's called Indian Nations Conservation Alliance.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:49:10):**  And he's a Navajo and Pueblo, New Mexican, and went to King School Ranch Management and  has done all the things and all the experience and is working closely with Navajo people  to try to help them improve their range management and cattle production and marketing.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:49:30):**  And it just got me thinking, and I'm speculating a little bit, but there's a lot of things  about holistic management that are not going to be cult, and how we typically do it, I  will say, that are not going to be culturally appropriate for all the people across the  
**[0:49:46-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:49:46):**  world who manage livestock and manage land.  And in some ways, it's an especially useful tool for people who come from a more Western  lineage, cultural otherwise, because many of us are so divorced from our communities  
**[0:50:01-0:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:01):**  and cultures of origin, and we have forgotten these life ways and patterns and ancestral  patterns of working with land and animals.  And so the sort of rubric and spreadsheet approach to holistic plan grazing is really  
**[0:50:13-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:13):**  helpful for us in how our minds often work and how we do business and interact with the  world.  It's not going to be the case for every person, and yet the function of thinking in a way  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:24):**  that encompasses all the stakeholders, all the factors at play, thinking that is broad  and expansive is something we all need to be doing, but there's just different ways  of doing it.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:33):**  That's something I'd like to see the sort of general regenerative agriculture holistic  management world expand into is how can we adjust and augment our language and our tools  to get to these goals of a holistically managed land base, but be creative and nimble in how  
**[0:50:49-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:49):**  we go about that.  And that's a big challenge for me as someone who is, as you can tell, kind of verbose and  likes words and language.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:50:57):**  There's a lot of people where the less you say, the better, and it makes things you do  say and even things like our body language and our tone, those are a part of language.  And those are legitimate parts of language for many people in many cultures, even just

Those are all ways of communicating what goes on sad matters.  And that's a challenge for me and my personality, but it's something because I care about ultimately  
**[0:51:25-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:51:25):**  the results in people's lives and the land, it's something that I'm trying to tune into  and learn from and I hope others are as well.  That's great.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:51:32):**  But relearning the ancestral approach to land management.  I love that.  Yeah, it's hard.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:51:40):**  Many of us are paradoxically impoverished in that respect.  And I'm really glad for...  You have...  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:51:45):**  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Impoverished not just in wealth, but impoverished in knowledge.  
**[0:51:49-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:51:49):**  Yep.  Knowledge and knowledge born of a, not just sort of semantic knowledge of knowing how  to do things and knowing specific facts, but knowledge that is deep where the connections  
**[0:52:00-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:52:00):**  and relationships are not just known, but felt.  Right.  As far as resources, how can we, someone like me who wants to learn more about that in learning  
**[0:52:12-0:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:52:12):**  and knowledge, do you have any suggestions on how I could reach out to better educate  myself?  That's a good question.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:52:20):**  And a question I'll always, I feel like I'll think of things after the interview has ended.  I just think about how this whole 2020 year has gone on and how I've had to re-look at  things and situations and was I raised that way or was my culture, was my mindset thinking  
**[0:52:38-0:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:52:38):**  that way and I didn't even realize it.  And so I think one thing I've talked with Brian about is I have to learn some habits  that I don't realize they have or mindsets that I don't realize I have.  
**[0:52:51-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:52:51):**  And I'm always looking for other perspectives to help me kind of have that paradigm shift  or even just like uncover that like I need to not have these nuances in my life.  I think it's such a challenge because, you know, Brian, you and anyone on your show and  
**[0:53:10-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:53:10):**  we're in UCK, we're all bought into this idea of we're trying to harmonize the way the world  is in the current economic system and all of the things with realities of human nature  and with realities of ecology and like no biggie, right?  
**[0:53:29-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:53:29):**  It's only the hardest possible thing.  But it's just the day's work though.  Yeah, it's just a, you know, seven generations worth of work probably if we're lucky.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:53:41):**  But I think something I've found helpful, yeah, I mean there's so much to say on this  and most of the good stuff is probably can be said from someone other than me, but I'll  take a crack at it.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:53:52):**  I've been trying to apply some principles of relationships with people to relationships  with land.  So what I mean by that is, you know, we have a lot of kind of good common sense heuristics  
**[0:54:04-0:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:54:04):**  about, you know, relating to other people, things like don't take advantage of other  people, be respectful, be mindful of how our actions affect them and also things that are  a little more self-critical like how am I taking this person for granted?  
**[0:54:21-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:54:21):**  You know, what is my attitude towards this person?  And so on.  I think we can turn those around and think about land too.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:54:28):**  And I think a big part of our problem is we have stripped land and its beings of its,  I won't say of its sentience because that can be mistaken, but of its sort of life force.  We have, you know, we've commodified everything and reduced everything to recently bought  
**[0:54:43-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:54:43):**  and sold and that I think is a pretty difficult page to turn.  That I think, you know, there's specific strategies and practices we can do, but on simply an  attitudinal individual attitudinal level, I think it helps do whatever work is required  
**[0:54:59-0:55:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:54:59):**  to regard land as a living source of our sustenance.  And of course animals is being part of that as well and fungi too.  And the other thing though is I think a part of that learning process and I feel like I'm  
**[0:55:15-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:55:15):**  still in the very infant stages of this for myself, but there's so many people who have  intact and retained cultural ways of relating to land that are just more practical on the  long term than a sort of Western imperialist approach.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:55:33):**  And it serves everyone to be trying to support those people and support their causes, support  their access to land and their ability to manage it.  And I think that kind of helps us to really support them doing that within the context  
**[0:55:48-0:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:55:48):**  of our current economy and current laws and regulations and so on.  A metaphor I like to think in terms of is how do I work within the current system to  find the cracks in it to sow seeds for a better one.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:55:59):**  And there's a lot of different ways that work can look like.  But I think, especially those of us who are working with livestock and prairie and real  estate, those removed of its indigenous inhabitants, animals, for in many cases by and for cattle  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:56:16):**  ranching.  And that's just the reality that we're living and working.  There's no need to ignore that or deny it.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:56:22):**  It's like, how can we go forward with that?  And I'm very excited about that and really think-  We do have to acknowledge that there is a little bit of irony there.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:56:30):**  Pretty ironic.  Yeah, we did kind of clear it out and ruin it for cattle ranching.  But as it turns out, ironically, the way to fix the problem we created is by simply with  
**[0:56:42-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:56:42):**  cows but better management.  Yeah.  Cows were in many cases bison or managing wildlife more thoughtfully.  
**[0:56:49-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:56:49):**  I think for me, I want to see all people who feel a need and a drive to live, to find the  livelihood on land, be able to do so.  And no matter who they are, no matter where they come from, because we need it and the  
**[0:57:04-0:57:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:04):**  world needs it, the climate needs it, biodiversity crisis needs it.  And so I think-  I think our culture needs it too.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:12):**  Our culture is just so disconnected from the land and food production as a whole that I  think that's pretty disturbing.  Yeah.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:21):**  And right now, as I understand it, the biggest threat to biodiversity in the United States  is habitat loss.  And a lot of that loss is happening in places that are prairie, grassland, whatever you  
**[0:57:32-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:32):**  want to call it, basically, functionally speaking, a rangeland ecosystem.  We're losing that to housing developments and to commercial developments and to tillage-based  agriculture.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:42):**  And so personally, I don't really care what kind of animals we're working with on a landscape.  I just think we need them out there.  We need animals instead of new subdivisions.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:57:55):**  And there's plenty of subdivisions.  We need to retain what we have and we need to expand it through pretty much through a  whatever means necessary.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:03):**  And there's so many people who still have cultural patterns of how to do that.  And we can compare notes and work together.  It doesn't have to be a complete silo.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:14):**  So that's exciting to me.  And there are so many good people I hope you'll have in your podcast in the future who are  hard at work at that.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:20):**  If you have any recommendations, please forward them over.  The recommendations you gave me a couple of weeks ago were just absolutely fantastic.  And I'm looking forward to getting in contact with them and having them on the podcast.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:31):**  Awesome, too.  So what's one myth about you that you'd like to take this opportunity to debunk?  I don't know if I reach myth status.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:42):**  So I don't know.  If you have any ideas, you'll have to tell me.  Well, one thing a lot of people might not know about me, including close friends, is  
**[0:58:51-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:58:51):**  I am very, in some ways, newly very interested in artwork and painting in particular.  And I'm actually working a couple days less per week on the ranch this winter to take  advantage of having time in a house with a studio to focus on artwork.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:59:09):**  And I got to say, as a kid, I really wanted to paint for a living.  And then I was introduced to agriculture.  And in particular, sustainable, small-scale agriculture, which can make a martyr out of  
**[0:59:23-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:59:23):**  anyone for better or for worse.  And so I set all that stuff aside.  And it's really challenging for me to find a way to value something like making pretty  
**[0:59:32-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:59:32):**  pictures when I feel like the world is half the time crashing down around me.  So that's something I've been sort of trying to lean into and explore and try to think,  how can I use my art in a way to advance some of the ideas and values that I think are important,  
**[0:59:48-0:59:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:59:48):**  whether that's stuff like reciprocity in a relationship with nature or something more  brass tacks like low-stress livestock handling.  I don't know.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=0:59:58):**  I'm not exactly an illustrator yet.  But this is coming partly out of the idea that I want to be doing this my whole life,  this kind of work.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:00:06):**  I don't want to be an agricultural martyr or an activist who burns out.  And that's not a good way to live for myself.  And that kind of attitude is just coming from a very extractive economy that I would like  
**[1:00:17-1:00:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:00:17):**  to plant.  So that's just a lead right now.  I'm just kind of sniffing into the wind trying to figure out where I can take that appetite  
**[1:00:26-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:00:26):**  that I have.  But there's so many changes that I hope to see in our culture that aren't going to come  rhetorical discussions on Twitter or Facebook or aren't going to go through well-framed  
**[1:00:40-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:00:40):**  monologues in an essay-based format.  It's like we need different ways of communicating our ideas and of receiving information because  if holistic management teaches us anything, it's that a lot of our decisions that we make  
**[1:00:52-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:00:52):**  and a lot of the reasons our land looks the way it does is through the things we don't  examine, our feelings and emotions and attachments and affect that we have to find a different  way of interacting.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:01:02):**  So you mentioned the extractive economy and we've been talking about holistic grazing  and trying to regenerate landscapes.  So what are some of the things that the average listener that's in a filing cabinet for young  
**[1:01:17-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:01:17):**  urban professionals in a city, what are some of the things that somebody that can't get  out and work with animals do?  What are some of the things they can do to help move the needle?  
**[1:01:28-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:01:28):**  I mean, the easy answer is like go try to buy grass-fed beef from a local rancher whose  practices you value it.  That's really important for sure.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:01:37):**  But I think that part of why the regenerative agriculture, why it always feels like an uphill  battle is that we require practitioners on the land to have so many skills that already  exist out there in a lot of other professions.  
**[1:01:52-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:01:52):**  So I don't have a really good specific answer, but I mean, I think pasture map is a great  example of people who have skills that maybe are not specifically quote in the fields,  getting their boots dirty and their hands dirty, but skills that nonetheless your average  
**[1:02:07-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:02:07):**  farmer rancher couldn't just design mapping and record keeping software.  And like I never, I'd never want to learn to code.  No, thank you.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:02:16):**  I'm so glad that there are people who do and have applied that towards the needs of farmers  and ranchers to be able to steward their land and resources better.  And you know, another example that comes to mind sort of along those lines is there's  
**[1:02:29-1:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:02:29):**  a new project called, I think it's called the Good Meat Project.  And the Good Meat Breakdown is sort of a particular program of theirs.  And that was started by a woman, her name is escaping me and Beth's going to kill because  
**[1:02:42-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:02:42):**  they're good friends.  But a woman who wanted to, as I understand it, you know, wanted to learn more about where  food comes from and learn to, she became a butcher and learned to break down animals.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:02:53):**  And through that lens began to see all the disconnects between people and producers.  And it was just like, this is something that we can solve through, you know, highly attainable  and shareable visual information.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:08):**  And there's so many ranches that have tried to put together their own little pamphlets  and booklets with how to buy beef and what percentage of wood and why there's disparity  between the pounds you get versus the pounds you pay for and so on.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:21):**  This just cuts through all of that.  Any farmer or rancher can go refer to their customers.  They have stuff that you can share that you can use, you know, for your own promotion  
**[1:03:31-1:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:31):**  of marketing and share.  And that's an example of someone from the outside, you know, who didn't grow it, who  solved the problem.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:39):**  We'll have to make sure we get that link in the show note page.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, and you can Google it and find it, but I'll, I'll send it along as long as, as  
**[1:03:47-1:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:47):**  well as other stuff too.  Another person that your listeners might be interested in is this guy, Chris Newman of  Sylvan Aqua Farms, who is like totally, you know, super abrasive.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:03:59):**  Brian's smiling.  Say things plenty of people.  I want him on the show.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:04:03):**  I got to get a contact for him.  I want to get him on the show.  He'll say things that will piss you off.

And nonetheless, any grownup can, should be able to handle hearing things said in a abrasive  way that are still true.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:04:25):**  And, and he's doing really good stuff in his mid Atlantic region.  I think he's in Northern Virginia.  That's the case he makes is like, we need to move beyond this thing where the small  
**[1:04:36-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:04:36):**  family farm is a paragon of sustainability.  There's so many people who have skills and desire to work in agriculture.  We don't all need to know how to do the books and do the planning and get the permits for  
**[1:04:48-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:04:48):**  a new building and, and, you know, be able to move cows and test forage and, and do all  the things.  Like there's so many thick skills that we can involve other people in and move the needle  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:01):**  much more rapidly.  Yeah.  And that's, that's something I'm excited about too.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:06):**  And Sam and I talk a lot about is how do we, um, how do we forge partnerships based on  shared values, but complimentary skills and have those partnerships and be professional  above board, have bylaws and agreements, you know, and learn from all the hippies and their  
**[1:05:21-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:21):**  intentional communities who learn the hard way, what works and what doesn't and how far  idealism takes you and where it falls apart.  And in, in many ways, the more we treat agriculture like a real business, provided we are internalizing  
**[1:05:34-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:34):**  incorporating a lot of the factors that externalizes we treat it like a business, we'll be able  to achieve our ecological goals way better than if we try to just do the right thing  by the environment and sacrifice the process of our business relationships too.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:47):**  That's great.  So burning question on my mind.  You could have dinner with, Oh man, why I've never asked myself this question.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:05:54):**  So I still don't know the answers I would do for that, Brian.  Why didn't put you on the spot yet?  I know you're safe for another episode, but it's been weeks that we've been asking this  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:04):**  and I'm like, I still don't know the answer.  So if you come up from the aerial, I'm impressed.  Cause I know.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:10):**  Yeah.  This is one of those questions that I'm sure in the future, I'll be smacking my face and  like, gosh darn, why didn't I know?  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:17):**  I know the perfect case.  Okay.  Just shoot from the hip.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:20):**  Okay.  So I'm going to be Yvonne Ilitch who was a like excommunicated Catholic radical who had  a lot of really cool ideas about what he called a convivial society.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:32):**  And he wrote a book called G schooling society and in kind of the connection between authority  and education and what that does to the human mind.  He'd be one person he's he passed away, I think.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:47):**  But if we can revive him for dinner, that would be great.  I like it.  I would love to have dinner with Brené Brown.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:06:57):**  I think that woman has so much to offer those of us in agriculture, because I think a lot  of agriculture makes its decisions for reasons of self-protection and avoiding shame rather  than advancing something.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:11):**  And she, you know, offers the lay person so much good stuff for trying to get beyond that.  Maybe we should try to get her on the podcast.  That would be the best man.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:21):**  I'll just stumble into that zoom meeting accident.  We'll have you in the background.  I'll take notes.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:29):**  Who else?  Give me just this.  If you wanted to come back for that as a special guest guest host, you could definitely arrange  
**[1:07:36-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:36):**  that.  That is one thing I know that I could do well is talk with me around.  You have to mail her like a good ribeye or something.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:43):**  So they have so many people kind of dancing around.  You'll have to edit this part out.  I hesitate to say this because I feel like it could be such a cliche answer, but I would  
**[1:07:58-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:07:58):**  be really interested in spending time with like Rosa Parks or like her.  Yeah.  Anybody.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:05):**  I thought you were going to say Alan Savory.  That would be cliche.  Rosa Parks isn't cliche.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:09):**  I've had dinner with Savory.  So she took that off her bucket list.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:14):**  I'm good.  Oh, you lucky dog.  Yeah, he visited the Nature Preserve.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:18):**  That was good.  I tried to ask him all my questions.  Rosa Parks or someone like her, by which I mean somebody who, because they came from  
**[1:08:27-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:27):**  a background and lived in a period of time, they did not have a lot of power or resources.  Not only took a big risk for what they believe was right, but took it in a way where they  knew exactly what was on the line.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:40):**  That I think that those two things combined.  But I mean, to me, that's what defines real courage is someone can really say, I know  exactly what I'm giving up.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:47):**  This is not an impulse.  I know exactly what I'm risking.  I'm very impressed by people like that.  
**[1:08:52-1:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:08:52):**  And I would love to just like have any of that kind of rub off me.  Because I think some of it's strength of character, some of it's a personality, how they're raised  and some of it's just giving a lot of hard thinking and willing themselves to the point  
**[1:09:04-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:04):**  of courage.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:07):**  We're kind of coming up toward the end of the scheduled time and I really appreciate  you joining us today.  Is there anything we've left on the table?  
**[1:09:12-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:12):**  Oh, so many things.  We should do this again.  There's plenty to talk about.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:15):**  We will do it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:18):**  Good.  I mean, I think the question of like finding good mentors and in good work, working situations,  there's a lot to chew on there for people.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:27):**  And also just like, I would love to brainstorm with the both of you and any guests you had  on how can we advance ranching in a way that takes the best of intergenerational family  farms and ranches, but also opens the door a little wider and has creative arrangements  
**[1:09:45-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:09:45):**  and working agreements and business structures that just advances us so much faster towards  the goal of people having a good livelihood and rural revitalization and bringing more  people to the table and to the land who usually can't be there.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:00):**  And I just think we're scratching the surface and it's an exciting time to be a first-generation  grazer personally.  Awesome.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:07):**  Is there anything you'd like to ask CK or myself?  Well, the first thought is who you would have dinner with, Brian.  Surely you have an answer.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:15):**  No, I really don't.  Wow.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:19):**  I just honestly, I haven't thought about this.  I would have to say Alan Savory.  And I think I'd want to sit down with Stan Parsons too.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:26):**  Oh yeah.  Good one.  The two of them together again at dinner, I think the Epic.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:34):**  They both did kind of start in the same place, HMI and Ranging for Profit.  And I've been through both courses and I think they're both terrific, but they started in  the same place.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:43):**  And now I think it's awesome as watching both committees grow that everything is kind of  come full circle and Alan and he's coming back to me.  So I think it'd be pretty cool to have both of them at a table.  
**[1:10:54-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:10:54):**  Not just so I could yack at them, but have a few questions.  And Brené Brown to mediate, right?  Okay.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:11:01):**  I'll just cheat and go with that one.  If we're going to have those two, you might want to have a psychologist there as well.  That's probably a great choice, especially because of her work about ego and shame and  
**[1:11:16-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:11:16):**  being able to communicate some of those things.  So yeah, I think that that would be perfect.  Stan Parsons, Alan Savory and Brené Brown.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:11:23):**  Yeah, it's definitely good to, I mean, it's a good practice to try to think about people  who've started from the same vantage point and went different direction and it's not  often that we can ask them why, like, why did you go that way?  
**[1:11:35-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:11:35):**  And I think so oftentimes the answer is because, well, this other guy was going that way.  And so in fact, people often seem like they're forging in opposite directions, but they're  really just trying to kind of round out something for fear of it being lopsided.  
**[1:11:46-1:12:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:11:46):**  You know, it's kind of like how siblings will become different people because of who their  brothers and sisters are than they otherwise would if they were born family children.  Yeah, and I think it was just like a very, very small difference that kind of split the  
**[1:12:01-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:12:01):**  two back in the early eighties.  And it was just such a small thing.  And like the concept that's in my mind, you can be 95% similar to somebody I'm sharing,  
**[1:12:11-1:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:12:11):**  but disagree so significantly over that 5% that you can't work together.  And I think that, you know, we've got a better awareness of that and those sorts of things  now.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:12:23):**  And there's more tools to communicate and share knowledge.  So that threshold is going to be a commonality.  I do have, I just thought of another question for you, Brian, for both of you, but I think  
**[1:12:33-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:12:33):**  Brian, you might have thought it, you've probably thought about this a few times.  If you were to design a feedlot, because feedlots play an important part in agriculture as we  know it right now.  
**[1:12:43-1:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:12:43):**  If you were to design a feedlot that had the goal of fattening cattle, which is the primary  rule, but you wanted to do it in a way that also not only took care of and attended to  the animals welfare, but also to their other sort of psychological needs.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:00):**  You know, cattle like to explore and rub and whatnot.  How would you design it?  Well, if you're just going to put me in charge of the world and give me a blank check to  
**[1:13:08-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:08):**  work with, it wouldn't look like a feedlot.  We just take all of Western Kansas, put a fence around Western Kansas and get some herders  into water development, maybe break it all up a little bit and herd them across.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:20):**  I'm thinking a lot of the farm, you know, tillage farm ground should all be, you know,  could all go to cultivated annuals, annual blends, grazing blends that are designed to  put not only pounds on animals, but also carbon in the soil and using that in conjunction  
**[1:13:37-1:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:37):**  with a no till.  I think there's plenty of land out here in the plains to holistically raise far more  grass fed beef commodity production.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:46):**  I'd love to visit that feedlot, probably smell a lot better than the ones off I-5 in Southern  California.  Probably think it would smell great.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:54):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  
**[1:13:57-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:13:57):**  Well, I have plenty more questions I could ask, but if you need to wrap things up, I  understand.  We can always have you back in another time.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:14:03):**  Ariel Greenwood, the Nomad Grazer, it has been absolutely a pleasure to have you with  us today.  Is there any websites, resources or places you want to send people, products you want  
**[1:14:13-1:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:14:13):**  to hype real quick before we go ahead and sign off?  Our website is just grassnomads.com and you can get in touch with us that way.  I also have ariagreenwood.com, which is basically a blog.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:14:25):**  I very rarely update it, but I actually just in the past few days I'm working a bit of  an exploratory essay that I think I'll title Practical Pastoralism that will talk about  some of the things we talked about today and your readers or your listeners might find  
**[1:14:41-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:14:41):**  it interesting and be cool if they would read it once it's up, hopefully by the end of a  few days and definitely by the time this airs in late February.  Yeah, I think you're on a schedule for third or fourth week February.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:14:52):**  Okay.  If it's not up by then, then send me an angry email, but it should be up then and I would  love if people tuned in and commented and yeah, there's just a lot of discussions and  
**[1:15:02-1:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:15:02):**  sticking points that I think are unnecessary if enough people just kind of turn their attention  to it.  I love engagement from people that way and I'm not on Facebook and stuff like that that  
**[1:15:13-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/5--Ariel-Greenwood-Relearning-the-ancestral-approach-to-land-management-esulg0#t=1:15:13):**  often anymore, but I like email correspondence like that.

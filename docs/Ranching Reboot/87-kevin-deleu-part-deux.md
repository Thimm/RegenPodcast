Today we're going to unpack AI protocols and EPDs for dummies. Kevin talks  about grazing in Brazil and the cattle business and what it's like down there. And we discuss  
**[0:00:56-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:00:56):**  the future of the seed stock business, genetics and the cattle industry in general.  All right, got to pay some bills. If you haven't heard about Anchor by Spotify, it's the  easiest way to make a podcast with everything you need all in one place. Let me explain.

**[0:01:50-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:01:50):**  doing great. Nice cool morning up here in the Red Hills. Just got to enjoy a little  bit of a rain shower this morning while I was out checking the cows. Oh, good deal.  Not it. Probably not even measurable, but it was nice to at least feel rain on my face.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:02:02):**  Yep. Yeah, we have a little bit of rain in the forecast coming up. So hopefully it hopefully  it shows up. You know, going into, you know, two years of this hard drought. I don't even  it's I don't even want to look at a forecast anymore because it doesn't ever say anything  
**[0:02:18-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:02:18):**  good. It's just Yeah, he's hot and dry. Like, crap. If I want a Groundhog Day, I just go  watch go rent the movie. Right. Around here. I mean, especially during the summer. There'll  be they'll say, Well, we got a bunch of rain coming bunch of rain coming. Well, then time  
**[0:02:35-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:02:35):**  shows up and there's no rain. And we get that a lot during the summer, at least in the winter.  It's it seems like it's a little more on point whenever they say there's rain coming.  Well, wouldn't it be nice to have that job? You could be wrong 95% of the time, and you're  
**[0:02:54-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:02:54):**  still going to get paid like, Yep, if we're wrong 95% of the time, we're probably you  and I are probably out of business.  Yeah, exactly. No, they they're, they're set.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:03:04):**  Yeah. All right. Well, I wanted to have you back again. And because we didn't really talk  about anything last time I had you on the show. Like, I mean, we talked about  We kind of rambled.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:03:17):**  Welcome to ranching reboot. Yeah. That's kind of what we do most of the time. Right. So,  there's a bunch of other things I wanted to ask you about. I'm not even I'm not even really  sure what are stored on this. I guess I guess we could kind of, you know, take at it with  
**[0:03:40-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:03:40):**  kind of attack. You're not attacked. That's the wrong word. She don't even know what I'm  talking about. Let's talk about cows. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about like, I have  some questions about AI. Like, okay, you know, and this will show my ignorance. So, like,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:03:56):**  I kind of know the broad strokes, right? But I don't know, you know, some of the nuts and  bolts details. And I want to talk about EPDs like and maybe we can really dig down into  EPDs and and discuss some of those. So and I do have I do have some other questions that  
**[0:04:12-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:04:12):**  you know, folks have kind of sent in. One of the things I'd like to talk about, since  you're in a registered business, and I'd like to talk about showing value or perceived value  in a show ring, as compared to customer value or producer cost. And, and by breeding to  
**[0:04:36-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:04:36):**  the show ring standards, are we doing our breeds any favors in the long term? Okay,  gotcha. Gotcha. So how do you want to start off? Man, I don't know. Well, how about calving  ease bulls? That's that's an easy one. I know we've talked about that a little bit. So I  
**[0:04:58-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:04:58):**  want to I kind of operate under the theory that we've gone entirely too far with calving  ease bulls and pretty much everything out there is quote, a calving ease bull. And I'll  also say this, you know, I expect to, I try to treat my heifers just like the cows I wish  
**[0:05:15-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:05:15):**  they were like, that's, that's how I sum up my heifer development program. Okay. Like,  I have my ideal cow, one that sticks, rocks, dirt, salt and scenery. Yeah, maybe a little  protein supplement in winter. And that's how I want my cows to perform. So I've got to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:05:29):**  push my heifers to that standard. So I don't feel like, you know, if I separate out my  heifers, and I feed them different, I feed them special, to try to boost their fertility.  I don't feel like I'm doing my cow herd any favors in the long run, by, you know, by by  
**[0:05:44-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:05:44):**  trying to, quote, set those animals up for earlier success, rather than letting them  fail in the system and weeding them out.  Yeah. No, yeah, no, I think you're definitely right on that, at least can't push them too  
**[0:05:56-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:05:56):**  hard, because they're the ones that are gonna, they need to be able to perform for the rest  of their, their lives, hopefully, they're on the operation.  And okay, and I guess that kind of can tag into discussion we had in the last day or  
**[0:06:08-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:06:08):**  so about bulls. Like, it was a one of my fans actually texted me this morning, Lincoln.  And we're talking about bulls. And so I've been, I operate under the philosophy that  I want to buy my bulls from somebody as close to me on as similar of a program as I can  
**[0:06:32-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:06:32):**  find. Like, I don't want to go buy bulls that, you know, from about six months age, they've  been pushed with a lot of creep feed and a lot of corn and a lot of high energy feed.  Yeah, that's not what's going to make my program successful. What's going to make my program  
**[0:06:48-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:06:48):**  successful is a bull that can, that basically I can put in the worst on the worst grass  in the worst pasture and forget about and he's gonna look awesome. Like, that's the  bull, like, that's the bull that's going to succeed in my program.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:07:02):**  Yep. And he's going to go out there and still breed all the cows on whatever, you know,  whatever it is he has available, you know, to eat. And that's a big problem, especially  in Angus, I see it a lot. The calves just get pushed way too hard. You go to see them,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:07:19):**  well, you know, any fat animal looks good. And some of those bulls, they get pushed so  hard they'll look like another bull in the same pen that might perform even better, but  they're just so fat, you have no idea. And then you go take them out and put them out  
**[0:07:36-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:07:36):**  on the range or something, go to work, and they just fall apart. And then at that point,  you don't know what kind of progeny you're going to be getting out of them. Is that what  you're going to be getting is just animals that fall apart or they have to perform on  
**[0:07:52-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:07:52):**  grain?  And you know, that goes back to understanding your customer and understanding what value  as a business is providing to your customer and who your customer is like. We have completely  
**[0:08:09-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:08:09):**  different customer bases, right? And understanding what your customer wants, I think is, you  know, it's important for me being in a cow calf wanting to look at, you know, maybe,  maybe get a seed stock business later or selling cows or selling some of my heifers off later.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:08:29):**  You know, it's a difficult thing to do.  Yeah.  Like, you know, that some of the record keeping is, you know, the registered folks want, like,  
**[0:08:42-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:08:42):**  got to get the calf weight within 24 hours. Like, I can't have 150 acre pastures. Like,  it's not quite that easy. And they'll, you know, they'll have adjustments also that you  can do for birth weight. But even then, I think most people don't even realize how much  
**[0:09:01-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:09:01):**  their calves weigh. A lot of times, you know, a calf that could be, you might think it's  80 pounds, it could be 90 pounds, or it could be 70 pounds. It's just a matter of going  out there and actually, you know, weighing them. And it was kind of tying back to what  
**[0:09:15-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:09:15):**  you were saying earlier about calving these bulls. I think we too much focus on the calving  ease over time. It, it hurts the structure of the cow and whatever females you keep retaining  out of that kind of genetics. At that point, that's when you're going to start having more  
**[0:09:37-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:09:37):**  problems with your calving ease maternal, where the cows are going to have more problems  with dystocia, if they happen to have a head, a real heavy calf or a big calf, they're going  to probably have dystocia, you're going to have to pull the calf. And a lot of times  
**[0:09:51-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:09:51):**  that coincides with generations of calving ease that are backed up in the pedigree. And  just, you know, just because an animal has a real high calving ease, real low birth weight,  it just, it doesn't mean that the animal is going to end up performing the exact same  
**[0:10:08-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:10:08):**  in the pasture. They're going to, they need to have a calving ease bull in order to have  a calf almost.  And I don't, that almost seems like we've taken things too far. Like when we, when we  
**[0:10:22-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:10:22):**  have these really big 1200 pound cows, or you know, the 1000 pound cow that nobody's  ever actually put on a scale. Like, if a 1200 pound cow can't have, you know, a 70, 80 pound  calf, why do our cows weigh 1200 pounds? I mean, I don't know what any mine weigh. I'll  
**[0:10:41-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:10:41):**  be I'll be straight up honest, and I suck at estimating weight by eyeballing. But, you  know, some of my little corianic cows have calf that's not a whole lot bigger than a  jackrabbit and six months later, he's only standing about six inches shorter than she  
**[0:10:53-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:10:53):**  is.  You know, and there's certain genetics also that it doesn't, I don't, I don't think that  can apply to I don't know exactly your cattle, but I'd imagine they couldn't probably handle  
**[0:11:06-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:11:06):**  a super heavy birth weight, Angus or charlay kind of bull. Let's say like they come out  with 100 pound calf, they're probably gonna have a little bit more harder trouble trying  to have them, you know, corianic cows, at least is what I'm imagining.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:11:23):**  Well, if I mean, I pay attention to Steve Campbell, and he talks about the slope between  hooks and pins, the hook bones in the pin bones. And I see, I see the more attractive  slope, like the pelvis rotation, I see that more in the coriantes and Longhorns than I  
**[0:11:43-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:11:43):**  see that in the continentals. Like, you see the continentals, especially the Angus, that  pelvis is rotated up, and there's a steeper slope from the hooks to pins, that pelvis  is rotated forward, which kind of constricts that birth canal opening.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:11:56):**  Yeah. And even the Brahmas will have that they prefer kind of a lot more slope, even  than Angus, sometimes sometimes Angus, they just they'll end up getting that tail head,  it just sticks straight up sometimes. And you can tell if that if it's an animal sitting  
**[0:12:15-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:12:15):**  there being flushed all the time, or that's just genetics. And that's, you know, the way  they look. And a lot of times I think that does come from the show ring visual appraisal  that people like to breed in. Whenever you're showing cattle, you'll loin them with the  
**[0:12:31-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:12:31):**  show stick where you'll just get the show stick and, you know, stick on their back.  So that way, they're, you know, nice and pretty.  Okay, so for the people that have never showed cattle or been around that, what the what  
**[0:12:43-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:12:43):**  the hell is a show stick?  Well, it's, you know, it's a stick that on the end has a even though what I'm going to  call it a poker on the end, and it has a hook, kind of like an L. And then you'll just use  
**[0:12:56-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:12:56):**  that to set up the feet. And also, you can scratch them on their belly and on their brisket  to keep them calm.  Okay, so it's, it's the stick y'all are carrying around that, you know, just get them get them  
**[0:13:07-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:13:07):**  exactly the right spot and keep them calm when you're when you're okay. Yeah, that was probably  the dumbest question asked on the podcast.  Never a dumb question.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:13:18):**  Okay, so we're talking about showing cattle. And I guess that's a good segue into what  I mentioned earlier about showing value. And so I'll shoot off my mouth and offer my, my  opinion for what it's worth. First, I kind of feel like what they're looking for in a  
**[0:13:39-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:13:39):**  show ring has almost no correlation to pasture performance. There's a lot of visuals I think  they look at in a show ring that, that if we're if we're trying to drive that metric  are maybe going to end up hurting our animal performance in a natural environment. And,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:13:59):**  you know, I get there's pressure competition, totally get it, you know, and you want your  animal to look the best there is. I would prefer to go to a cattle show where they were  all pulled straight out of the pasture the day before and hold to the show ring and maybe  
**[0:14:15-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:14:15):**  give it a bath like yeah, when you're spending six hours blow drying and put blue shampoo  in your cow, and it's on a special diet that you hand feed to it four times a day to get  that perfect show animal you're going to get paid a lot of money for. Is it good business?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:14:31):**  Are you doing anybody any favors out in the real world? I don't think so.  It's a beauty pageant for me. That's what I think it is. I think showing is really,  really helpful and good for the junior programs. And then once out of the junior programs,  
**[0:14:51-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:14:51):**  I don't I could some breeds, it works. But there's too many that breed for the show ring.  Instead of breeding for the pasture, and then they go to the show ring. There's a gentleman  that raises beef masters, and he'll take animals to the show ring. If you know, he'll pull  
**[0:15:15-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:15:15):**  them from the patch room and think, well, she's really pretty. That's kind of my ideal  kind of cow. I want to take her to the show ring and, you know, promoter and I think doing  like that is fine, because he was breeding for the pasture, he's breeding for performance.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:15:28):**  But then you get people that that's all they do. All they do is the show ring. That's all  they breed for. So what do they do? And they're breeding for a judge. They're breeding for  one guy's opinion, and to hopefully make bank on that. And I think it takes a lot away from  
**[0:15:45-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:15:45):**  the juniors in when there's parents that can buy their champions. They can buy the champions  for the kids, they they have $100,000 to spend. Okay, go buy that go win all the scholarships  that the other kids who need the scholarship money, and they're not going to get it probably  
**[0:16:03-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:16:03):**  because they their parents didn't have as much money as other ones that could buy the  champion. And then at that point, they say, Well, well, it's a good learning experience  for the juniors. Well, then what is that junior learning if mommy and daddy can go and buy  
**[0:16:14-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:16:14):**  all the champions for him, and then also help feed and then pay for the trailer, pay for  all the hauling pay for the hotel. I don't see much, unless that's all you do. And you  sell really high quality show cattle. I don't see where the return on investment is anymore.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:16:35):**  Considering the cost of feed, how much you have to feed them. Gas, you know, everything's  gone up. It's real, that's a really high input field in in the show in cattle.  That's that's why I've never been in it. I'm not I'm not a high input guy. And so the young  
**[0:16:59-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:16:59):**  man that has helped me the last two summers. Great, great kid named Keaton whisk. He's  doing the he's going for a degree at range management at Kansas State University. Really,  really super proud of this kid. Anyway, he started with me not long after I started the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:17:20):**  podcast, in fact. And we spent a lot of time that winter and spring, driving around looking  at cows. Now, Keaton has a background in showing that mostly he would show goats because goats  are cheap and you know, cows are not and it requires a lot less infrastructure to keep  
**[0:17:38-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:17:38):**  a goat or a show goat than it does show cow. So that's why he was in show goats. But he's  also an FFA and you know, he did some livestock judging and we you know, we talked a lot about  the difference between the show ring and and how my cattle would do like if I just took  
**[0:17:54-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:17:54):**  him from the pasture to the show ring and what the judges would be looking for. And  again, my incredibly limited experience. It seems like the judges want they want the steers  to look like heifers and they want the heifers to look like steers and they want everything  
**[0:18:13-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:18:13):**  to look square. Pretty much. And that just seems like it's completely backwards. You  know, you look in nature, okay, you you look at human boys and girls. We're different critters.  Okay, you look at you look at chimpanzees, they're different critters. You look at hippopotamus,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:18:35):**  males and females. They're totally different critters. I mean, the males have a bot males  have a phenotype and the females have a phenotype. And when we have these judges that are looking  for square cattle, you know, what's the hormone balance in that cat in that animal to make  
**[0:18:52-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:18:52):**  it look like that? I mean, I want my bulls to look like they're walking uphill on level  ground. You know, big shoulders, big neck, slim waist, good butt. I want my cows to look  backwards. You know, they need to look like they're going downhill on level ground. Good  
**[0:19:09-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:19:09):**  neck, not too heavy in the shoulders, big guts and a big butt. Yeah. Well, they need  to look like girls. Yeah, they need to have their feminine characteristics in that plays  back into their fertility. Also, you get, you know, the females that are just too short  
**[0:19:25-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:19:25):**  neck too short bodied. They look way too much like a bull. Well, that's what they're going  to produce as and it's not very well. If you know, if you have a cow that's just not feminine  at all, she doesn't have the characteristics to really have longevity in the herd.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:19:43):**  And likewise, I think the same should be true for bulls if he's, you know, not a really  masculine looking bull and not really expressing, you know, his his inner maleness. Mm hmm.  You know, that animal is going to be going to be subpar and not perform near as well  
**[0:19:58-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:19:58):**  in a pasture, I think. And there's a lot of bulls now that I see that are really EPD oriented.  And they just they don't look like bulls. They look like they should be seers. That's  what they should have been. But they're helping trait was, you know, the computer generated  
**[0:20:20-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:20:20):**  EPD that they have and that's what saved them. But no, then they go and get collected now  because of it. And just keeps propagating bad traits.  That's a good segue to tell me how you really feel about EPDs.  
**[0:20:36-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:20:36):**  They're helpful. They're a tool. And I, you know, I use them still. But if there are certain  EPDs, I won't, I don't want to go too extreme on whether too extreme low or too extreme  high just to save myself for my market still. And also because there's some truth to them,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:21:01):**  as well as genomics, which with Angus, it really doesn't matter up and once you have  the genomics enhanced into the EPDs,  Okay, what what are genomics for the five year olds like in the conversation,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:21:17):**  I'm not going to be the best at explaining this. It's taking the DNA on them, and then  sending it to the lettuce or to the Angus Association. And they'll it what it does is  it provides a little bit of accuracy to the EPDs. So on the EPDs, you know, you'll have  
**[0:21:35-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:21:35):**  the trait, which let's say birth weight, you have birth weight, and then you'll have the  EPD number itself, then you'll have the percentile rank, which would be, you know, of all the  animals in the, it's like class ranking in your high school, you know, if you're the  
**[0:21:50-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:21:50):**  top 1% in your class, your first or second smartest, well, some same goes for the EPDs  on the percentile rank. And then you'll have accuracy, which would be, you know, 50% accuracy,  75% accuracy. However,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:22:06):**  So it'd be like, they'd say, we're 50% sure that this, these genetics will, you know,  marble 90% prime.  Yeah, something like that. Yeah, that's Yeah, pretty, like 50% accuracy, kind of like weather,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:22:24):**  when the weatherman says there's a 50% chance of rain on this day. Well, there's a 50% chance  it won't. Yeah, exactly. And they'll usually start off with 5%, just as like baseline,  that means there's no accuracy at all. And the genomics will kind of bump it up, sometimes  
**[0:22:40-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:22:40):**  some of the traits will bump up to like 10, you know, point one, which would be like 10%,  20%, so on and so forth. And there's a lot of animals that I noticed in my herd, once  I get the genomics back, I'll look at the animal, see how they're performing. And it,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:22:58):**  to me, it coincides, I can definitely see why this one has such a higher weaning weight  compared to these others. And then there's some that they're just dinks, they're, they're  ugly, and they might have really good EPDs. Well, I'm like, well, the EPDs aren't right  
**[0:23:12-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:23:12):**  on this animal. So I'm not going to breed this animal with that in mind.  Or is that one of those things that, you know, it's just a genetic outlier, is, you know,  just bad roll the dice that day and just didn't get the right combination of genes.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:23:27):**  And I don't know if I explained it like this in the in the previous podcast, the way I  like to explain is like, you you want to go buy a box or tool chest, whatever, store all  your stuff in. And you have a few different brands you can pick from. Well, one of the  
**[0:23:44-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:23:44):**  brands is from a guy, he's been making these toolboxes his entire life, he makes it by  hand, he makes with all the different tools that he needs, he makes it according to your  specifications, he makes them custom does it really well, he has a really good product.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:23:59):**  Then you got another guy, he just went and hit, well, his product is made from a 3d printer,  the guy has enough money, he went out bought the 3d printer, and now he can just make the  exact same copy over and over and over again, that's the only tool he uses. And personally,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:24:15):**  I'd want the tool chest the toolbox from the guy who takes his time, uses every tool at  his disposal to make a good box compared to the other guy that just like an EPD breeders  just breeding on EPD is just that one tool just keep pushing them out, pushing them out,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:24:31):**  regardless of how good the feet are, how good the phenotype is.  Have you priced a handcrafted wooden toolbox?  It's probably a lot more expensive.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:24:41):**  They are.  That's why they go the other route.  They are high. And I appreciate that analogy. I appreciate that analogy. And I think it  
**[0:24:53-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:24:53):**  kind of, I can kind of see that as applying to, you know, the production side of agriculture  and the emerging regenerative slash grass fed side.  Yeah. Because like, you know, you could say the EPDs are like a hammer. Well, I don't  
**[0:25:07-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:25:07):**  need a hammer every single time, but maybe this one animal, the hammers worked really  well. And, you know, I can utilize that out of that animal, but.  Okay. EPD stands for expected progeny difference.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:25:23):**  Correct. Yes.  Now, I'm also going to say that when I get a bull catalog, it generally goes right in  the trash unless it's a, unless it's a federal cattle company. Those actually look at because,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:25:36):**  you know, the pictures are bigger, the data blocks bigger, and I don't have to put on  my reading glasses to read, you know, six point font and try to decode a bunch of numbers.  So other than, other than, you know, it is expected progeny difference. The hell does  
**[0:25:53-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:25:53):**  that even mean? And how do they figure it?  So I tell you what, I got a catalog right here, McKellar Angus. And I, this is a really  good operation that I use all the time. They're actually going to be having a sale coming  
**[0:26:06-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:26:06):**  up in October. So when you look at the EPDs, the progeny difference is saying, well, if  a bull is, let's say a plus one on his birth weight, and then you have another bull that  is a plus two, what it's saying is on average, the plus two bull will add two more pounds  
**[0:26:28-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:26:28):**  on average to the birth weight of his calves compared to, well, I said one, but a bull  that is a plus zero or a zero on his birth weight. So the other bull on average is going  to throw two pounds heavier on his calves than the other bull. Well, that doesn't mean  
**[0:26:46-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:26:46):**  that bull is going to be throwing 80 pound calves and this one's going to be throwing  60 pound calves. You don't really know, cause it's also dependent on the cow, right? What  mainly it's going to be dependent on the cow. So if you have,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:26:58):**  And that can be dependent on like, even if it's a donor cow. So like if you're doing  a, like a re-sip and a donor, that can be even weirder, right? I guess we can get back  into that later.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:27:12):**  I, I, I'm not very knowledgeable on that. I know that you can have birth weight differences  from embryo transfer. I think that's just something to do with the hormones maybe in  the re recipient cow as well. But yeah, I don't know a whole lot on that.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:27:32):**  Yeah. It didn't mean to get you off track there.  You're good. So what was I saying?  We're talking about birth weight DPDs.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:27:41):**  And some of my bulls, I use my herd siren, then the sun I retain out of him are over  a plus six on their birth weight. So what it's saying is on average, their calves are  going to weigh about six pounds heavier on average than compared to other sires. Well,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:27:59):**  you'll notice that in their progeny, their project are going to be in the 80 to 90 pound  range. Typically when some bulls are going to be lower might be in the 70 to 80 pound  range.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:28:10):**  Excuse me. Okay.  And another thing that people forget is that those DPDs can also compare to other breeds.  So a plus six Angus birth weight can be correlated to if I remember, I almost a negative two  
**[0:28:29-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:28:29):**  Charlet birth weight.  Are there good? Okay. So DPDs are are good tool for comparing within a breed.  Correct.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:28:41):**  So when you're trying to compare Angus EPDs with say Charlet EPDs, there's conversion  charts or is it? Yeah. Or is that just something that's like, you're really going to take with  a lot of grain of salt.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:28:54):**  Probably need to take it with a grain of salt. There's because I think another important  thing to factor in is also how many progeny going back in the pedigree have data turned  in on certain EPD traits. And like, especially compared to other breeds, because in the Brahmas,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:29:13):**  I don't, I don't even care about the EPDs because the most most bulls will have will  be less than 100 progeny. And then the Angus, you know, you'll have normally over 100 progeny,  1000 progeny, 10,000. And that's normal to see. So I don't think 100 calf set is really  
**[0:29:35-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:29:35):**  enough to get. That's not a big enough data set.  Yeah, especially when you have out of bulls that have semen that is really expensive,  and you're only flushing to cows. So then the majority of your calves are going to be  
**[0:29:48-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:29:48):**  out of one cow from a certain bull sometimes, not we're AI to the entire herd, and they  have 100 different cows, 100 different calves, and all out of the same bull, then you can  get a good idea of what what kind of data you're going to begin then from that bull  
**[0:30:07-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:30:07):**  later on.  So how do they figure up EPDs?  That I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. I think there's some of them that are  
**[0:30:20-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:30:20):**  Oh, what's the term? privately held information to the association just so it doesn't get  out to other associations to copy them. There is for instance, there's a dollar, there's  a value, an index value in the EPDs and Angus called dollar maternal and that information  
**[0:30:44-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:30:44):**  is privately the formula that goes into that dollar value is privately held information.  So you know, all the traits that go into the formula, but you don't know what the formula  is, actually.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:30:56):**  The one I really want to know about is the dollars energy.  So that should be the way I understand what they're telling us about the dollar energy  EPD is that's going to be a measure of how the animals were going to perform on grass  
**[0:31:14-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:31:14):**  how efficient of a converter she's going to be. That right?  That's typically I tell you what, I'll pull up the definition just so we know for sure.  But that's the way I see it. Typically, those grass efficient genetics are going to be higher  
**[0:31:31-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:31:31):**  dollar energy. And you'll notice that the really high performing bulls, really top 1%  birth weight or a little weaning weight yearling weight at super high performing bulls like  that are going to be very low on their dollar energy.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:31:48):**  Because they need a lot of power to put on those pounds a lot of high energy to put on  those pounds.  They need a lot of food. Let's see EPD and value definitions.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:31:58):**  And I suppose if you're living next door to an ethanol plant, you have unlimited access  to wet beet pulp and spent distillers grains for basically nothing. I mean, $20 a ton is  like an absurdly ridiculous price for that kind of cow feed. Yeah, build a feedlot, have  
**[0:32:14-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:32:14):**  some cows don't care about your dollar energy. But when when all you have is grass and negative  range, you know, a measure like dollar energy to me should be everything. But I really question  the validity of that dollar energy number. Because I have no idea how it's calculated.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:32:32):**  I have no idea if it has any bearing in the real world other than the Angus Association  saying yeah, you need a high dollar energy EPD in your cows. Okay, Angus Association  tell me what it is. Tell me how you figure it out.  
**[0:32:46-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:32:46):**  I found the definition here is it says expressed in dollar savings per cow per year assesses  differences in cow energy requirements as an expected dollar savings difference in daughters  of sires. A larger value is more favorable when comparing two animals more dollars saved  
**[0:33:03-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:33:03):**  on feed energy expenses. Components for the computing the cow dollar energy savings difference  include lactation energy requirements and energy costs associated with differences in  mature cow size. So animals that are going to be more grass efficient, have a higher  
**[0:33:21-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:33:21):**  dollar energy, they're going to be smaller mature frame cows, they're going to be cows  that don't milk as heavy, because the heavier milking a cow is, typically they're going  to need more energy requirements, takes power to make milk. But, you know, and, and, and  
**[0:33:39-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:33:39):**  that's the cost that it comes with with the high weaning weights, the high yearling weights.  Excuse me, I'm about to burp some. And yeah, and that's, I think that is an important EPD  value that you can look at as well as DMI, which is dry matter intake. On those cattle,  
**[0:34:03-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:34:03):**  you'll typically see the higher dollar energy kind of cattle, you'll typically see a lower  dry matter intake, which is important, you know, you want less intake to put pounds on.  And then there's another EPD called residual average daily gain, which you would want higher,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:34:22):**  obviously, higher average daily gain in a lower dry matter intake. So you know, less  feed, more gain. And that's, those are two EPDs I'm trying to keep at a good balance  with within my herd, I've been able to have a good start with that already. Is it something  
**[0:34:39-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:34:39):**  that I noticed very well in my cattle? Not really. But I think it's at least a starting  point for where I can begin to decrease my mature size on my cows and at least have that  EPD backing up that I can hopefully maintain that kind of efficiency with what I have so  
**[0:35:00-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:35:00):**  far, if that makes sense.  Yeah. Do we make our cows too big?  I think so. There's a lot of cows that people just love to show off how good a donors they  
**[0:35:11-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:35:11):**  are and stuff how fat they are. But it's tough for me to say because there's a gentleman  out in West Oklahoma, we talk a lot and he he prefers larger frame cattle on his on his  range. He says that the larger frame cattle just do better. And I think I want to say  
**[0:35:31-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:35:31):**  that he sells like at the sale barn. And typically they're they don't want cattle that are already  that already look finished. Right? You know, like feedlots, they're not going to go, they're  not going to go and buy calves that look like they're already finished. And by the time  
**[0:35:51-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:35:51):**  they're done finishing them, they're they're so overtly fat, they want calves that are  going to at least grow into themselves still, while they are being fed out. And a lot of  times the the, the more grainy fishing kind of cow are going to be larger framed is what  
**[0:36:10-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:36:10):**  I typically see. And but when you go and see an operation that I'm utilizing their genetics,  power plus cattle or dove cattle company in Oklahoma, they use a lot of the OCC genetics,  which is only Yeah, okay. You said I'm going to put that in a show notes. You said power  
**[0:36:30-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:36:30):**  plus power plus cattle? Yes. And what was the name on that? Duff cattle company. It's  the same thing, but they have their own feedlot, actually, where they feed out these, these  genetics. And I mean, they they reach prime and choice, just like all the rest. They're  
**[0:36:50-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:36:50):**  going to be smaller frame, probably smaller carcass weights. But I mean, I can I can imagine  those cattle would probably I'd imagine they would finish out quicker, you may not be getting  the same kind of carcass weight that I want to say that we've been trained to, to want  
**[0:37:10-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:37:10):**  because of the, you know, because the feedlots, they want a certain size carcass weight, they  want a certain size, to be able to get what they need from the packers and stuff.  You know, we're talking about like, the carcass size that the packers and the feedlots want.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:37:26):**  And this, you know, it circles back to understanding your customer base, you know, and like I said  before, y'all out there listening to this, and you know, you have a feedlot. Fine, that's  fine. Like, I'm not going to come, I'm not going to come to your door and yell at you  
**[0:37:40-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:37:40):**  for having a feedlot and then like talk shit on your waste management procedures. Okay.  I'm not that guy. I'm just going to keep asking you the questions like, are you sure this  is what we should be doing? You know, is this an ecologically sound process? So, you know,  
**[0:37:56-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:37:56):**  we've, the cow size is an interesting discussion because you know, you have on one hand, you'll  have like North American Meat Institute, you know, some breed associations saying, Oh,  yeah, we got to have these bigger cows, we got to have more pounds, more pounds, more  
**[0:38:10-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:38:10):**  pounds. But at the end of the day, it's not how many pounds you take to the sale barn,  it's what it costs you to raise those pounds, it's how efficient you were raising those  pounds. And you know, I like my Corianae cattle. Yeah, my cows are like my little cows are  
**[0:38:27-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:38:27):**  650. I've got a 10 year old cow that's 650 pounds and she's given me two calves already.  Like what's wrong with my little 650 pound cows? Like I got another one that's not a  whole lot heavier and her calf from this spring is only about three inches shorter than she  
**[0:38:42-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:38:42):**  is. It's kind of ridiculous to see this calf, this, you know, big steer calf nursing off  this little tiny 650 pound cow. It's like, that's a little weird, but it works. And if  I can, if I can have a 600 pound cow that's weaned in a 400 pound calf, I think that's  
**[0:39:02-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:39:02):**  a win. Like I would much rather wean a 400 pound calf off a 600 pound cow than a 600  pound calf off 1000 pound cow. Yeah, definitely. And, and when it comes right down to it, the  cows are what eat the grass. I mean, what that what that calf is going to eat in its  
**[0:39:22-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:39:22):**  first year of life, you know, daily dry matter intake is, is not much compared to the cow.  So, if we're just looking at trying to raise as many pounds of beef per acre as we can  pounds of protein per acre, it makes sense to have smaller cows. More hooves on the ground  
**[0:39:43-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:39:43):**  means more herd effect. And it means more calves. Yeah, I'm going to show up at the  barn with 400 pound calves. They're still going to sell for two bucks.  Yeah, yeah, because they still have the room that to grow into. And yeah, exactly. They'll  
**[0:39:58-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:39:58):**  sell for that. And the guy down the road is going to show up at the barn with 650 and  700s and wonder why he only got a buck and a half bucks 60 for him.  And how much how much more money did he spend on his cows, maintaining them than you did?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:40:13):**  And in the long run, you're going to be ending up making more profit.  Because I have more head and I'm bringing in more pounds with less feed costs and less  depreciation. Two biggest costs are under range. Cow depreciation and fed feed costs.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:40:30):**  If you can get those two under control, you're probably going to do okay. I covered depreciation  on the front end by buying depreciated out cows that nobody else wants. So, they're already  depreciated out. And they don't need a whole lot of feed. So, that helps me solve the fed  
**[0:40:46-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:40:46):**  feed costs.  Yeah, exactly. And right now, oh, go ahead. Sorry. No, no, no. I was done. Yeah. Right  now I'm trying to bring down my mature, my mature size on my cows because I had a cow  
**[0:40:59-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:40:59):**  run through the shoot the other day. What did we we were we were vaccinating. And we  put her on the scale. And she weighed 1750. And she didn't look 1750. She was pregnant  also. She was praying but she weighed 1750. And she's the same. Because that's the one  
**[0:41:20-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:41:20):**  thing about when we talk about mature size or mature weight. There's some cows, Angus  cows that they're not tall. They're not big framed, but they're heavy. They're thick,  they're wide. And I'll send you a picture of this cow. She's beautiful. She's exactly  
**[0:41:38-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:41:38):**  the way that you described, but she's 1700 pounds when she had a calf in her. And I don't  mind bringing down that weight just a little more because she  You know how many Corrientes I could run for that one 1700 pound cow. I could probably  
**[0:41:53-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:41:53):**  run four cows. Yeah. For what she eats.  And luckily, she's the kind that I don't have to, I don't have to supplement. You know,  she, she goes out to the pasture regards to the pasture, she keeps her weight, she keeps  
**[0:42:11-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:42:11):**  herself. So now with her, I'm going to breed her to a smaller, smaller frame, kind of bull,  hopefully bring that down.  But you want to keep her you want to keep her phenotype just shrink it a little bit.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:42:23):**  Yes. And because I have other cows that that will weigh about the same, but they're probably  two, three inches taller than her. And for me, that's too much. I'd rather have the 1700  pound cow that's smaller frame than the 1700 pound cow that's taller frame because that's  
**[0:42:40-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:42:40):**  the one that that's going to probably need more milk. It's kind of, that's not the kind  of approach on one shorter cow at the same weight is going to have more meat on the bone.  And it should have like logic says it should have more a better meat to bone ratio.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah. Yeah. And one thing the Brahma breed does this especially but they focus so much  on bone, especially in the show ring, because there's there's really focused on the show  ring and bone is a huge, the bigger the bone, the better. It usually seems but the problem  
**[0:43:17-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:43:17):**  with that is, I feel like you're taking away your longevity and your cow herd in at the  end, you're gonna start getting more joint problems, you get foot problems, weak pastures,  because there's so much weight that they're packing on to these animals. And just over  
**[0:43:29-0:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:43:29):**  time, you know, their pastures just collapse. Yeah. And they end up getting bad feet.  And there's, there's a post on Facebook, a guy was showing his embryos that he has out  of this cow. I looked at a cow and he was saying, Well, she has one of the biggest bone  
**[0:43:46-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:43:46):**  cows you'll ever find Brahma cow. And I go look at her at her production. She's only  raised one calf and she's 11 years old. He only has four other embryo calves. And I'm  thinking, guys, what are we doing? This isn't  
**[0:44:01-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:44:01):**  guys like that aren't doing the industry any favors.  They're not. And he there was another cow that he they'd posted. I have embryos out  of this cow. She's a double bred granddaughter out of this bull. She is pulled. She's a black  
**[0:44:17-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:44:17):**  Brahma. And I went and looked her up and she's five years old, never had a calf. Picture  of her. She's ugly. Never had a calf. But those three things, you know, she's pulled,  she's black, and she's double bred granddaughter, double bred granddaughter out of this bull.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:44:33):**  That means she's good. No, she needs to go to the sale barn. She needs to be out of here.  We don't need that genetics continuing.  She needs to be in a box somewhere at freezer camp.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:44:43):**  Yep, exactly.  I think there's, I feel like there's a lot of cows that guys are that are like that.  And is it somebody that's like, well, obviously, they have a day job, because there's no way  
**[0:44:57-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:44:57):**  that there's no way any anybody in the cattle business that's trying to actually make money  off of cows. Yeah, when I have a five year old cow that has only had one calf, like,  the only way that makes sense is there's massive subsidy or off farm job. Yeah, keeping that  
**[0:45:15-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:45:15):**  keeping that enterprise alive.  Yeah. And, well, he's hired by the owner of the ranch, and they had sold a company for  like 300 million. So he just had a bunch of a few money to throw out.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:45:29):**  You can say fuck you money. That's fine. We can test on his podcast.  If I won the lottery, if I had that kind of money, I would, luckily, I've already started  in this from like a, like a poor man's approach. So if I had that kind of money, I feel like  
**[0:45:46-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:45:46):**  I'd be on top of the game above everyone at that point, because I could utilize it so  well I could make  I saw that TikTok and I got to think, what would I do with $100 million? And the first  
**[0:45:59-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:45:59):**  thing I thought of is, idiot, you need to hire a lawyer, somebody gives you $100 million  in an account and not touch it and let them tell you how to spin it because you'll just,  you know, I'll just go to Vegas and do hookers and blow or something.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:46:12):**  With the way that I said it, that $100 million is gone already.  Yeah, like by every ranch that touches mine. Yep. Okay, we're done.  There's a good quote, like, I can't remember where I heard it, but there's somebody said,  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:46:29):**  well, I don't want to own everybody's ranch. I don't need to own all the land in the world.  I just want to own everything that touches my ranch.  Exactly.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:46:37):**  Yeah. Well, there's a point where that has to stop there, buddy.  And, you know, like, I, it's fun to dream like that and stuff, but you never know. If  it's a good way to at least keep you on your toes to be able to see where you could push  
**[0:46:57-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:46:57):**  your operation in a direction where you can have the best kind of outcome with the money  that you do have at least.  But thinking about having $100 million is way too much money for me. Like, I've got  
**[0:47:11-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:47:11):**  to think about like maybe having five, like, okay, I can think about how I could get rid  of five and leverage that for the rest of my life, you know, build a business that I  can, that'll provide me income for the rest of my life. I can do that with five. $100  
**[0:47:26-0:47:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:47:26):**  million is probably just turned me into a total idiot.  I wouldn't build a feedlot.  No, no, that's out of the question.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:47:39):**  I'd probably buy some extra land and I'd probably definitely, definitely double down on fencing  and water development. I hate to say this, but it probably be a lot more closer to what  Alejandro Carrillo is doing down at Chihuahua Desert, Mexico. You don't have any idea what  
**[0:47:58-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:47:58):**  I'm talking about down there?  No, no. I think I've heard something but  I'd say how many acres he's running down there, but I'll get it wrong. They spent so like  
**[0:48:08-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:48:08):**  Chihuahua Desert in Mexico, 12 to 14 inches of rain a year. Like farther south than you  and I. So it's definitely hotter and drier, probably higher country, you know, pre-poor  grass production. Like it's a lot of land. 20 some 25,000 acres, I think off the top  
**[0:48:26-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:48:26):**  of my head without, you know, I don't have Jamie around to look anything up or, you know,  or a Dave. I got to do all this.  That's all we need.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:48:35):**  Got to do all this off the cuff. Well, maybe one of these days we'll get some folks in  Discord that can look stuff up for us. But no, what he did is they went in and did super  intensive water development. Like miles and miles of pipe. Like makes my water systems  
**[0:48:53-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:48:53):**  we talked about last week, makes them seem like shit that wouldn't even get out of the  yard. Okay. Like miles and miles and miles of hundreds of tanks.  Oh, gosh, yeah.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:49:06):**  And what they did is they fenced the whole thing with electric fence and they fenced  one day paddocks. They have permanent one day paddocks on that ranch and they go move  cows every day on like a 20, 25,000 acre ranch. And we're not talking like like a two acre  
**[0:49:23-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:49:23):**  paddock here. Like I think we're talking like 10 and 20 acre paddocks that are permanently  fenced with electric fence. And, you know, hundreds are up in the thousands ahead of  cattle in one herd getting moved every day in permanent electric fence paddocks.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:49:40):**  Rotational grazing just.  I mean, rotation implies that there's a system that, you know, it's set. I think the term  that Alejandro would use or would like us to use would be adaptive multi paddock grazing  
**[0:49:54-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:49:54):**  or holistic adaptive plan grazing. Like, okay, there's too many damn terms around that nobody  can agree on. Like we don't have a common vocabulary dictionary and regenerative agriculture  and grazing and it kind of pisses me off sometimes, but we'll get there eventually. But no, the  
**[0:50:10-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:50:10):**  differences that he's found, you know, it's it's very similar what I've seen here, but  he's getting results a lot faster on a bigger scale than than I can afford to do here right  now.

See,  those ad reads aren't aren't so bad. I I do need to read. I need to re record that one.  That's not too bad. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So AI, educate me on AI. What? What's the how would  
**[0:52:26-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:52:26):**  you explain AI in cows to a five year old? Or does somebody say in Houston that works  in an office that yeah, but doesn't really see cows every day?  I think most people know even a little kid alone. Well, the well the the the daddy cow  
**[0:52:43-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:52:43):**  and mommy cow get together. Well, it's a way for the daddy cow mommy cow to get together  when daddy cow is $500,000 and halfway across the country. It's, you know, it's just a way  to be able to better your genetics from bulls that you don't have access to. And be able  
**[0:53:04-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:53:04):**  to also shorten your just your calving interval to where you can have I mean, you can have  a I mean, you can do with a bolt to if you do it just right. But be able to have all  your calves born on the same day. Pretty much. I mean, it'll be a span of a week or two.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:53:26):**  But you can AI all your cows on one day, it would be the same if the bull went out there  and bred all the cows on the same day. Also, it's not going to be every cow is going to  get pregnant. But but but everything that's going to calve on that day, what is it to  
**[0:53:39-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:53:39):**  268 days after service or what is it to 283 283. So anything that calves you know, 282  to 284 after service, you can be really sure was out of your AI bull everything later is  off your cleanup. Yeah, yeah. And you'll put the cleanup bull in after so that way you  
**[0:53:58-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:53:58):**  can like right now I've already finished all my AI calves being born. And the next go  round is going to be all natural exposed ones that didn't take the AI. So that that helps  a lot, especially be able to animals that can take to AI every year. I mean, it doesn't.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:54:18):**  It shows that the animals at least fertile enough that just one unit of semen, because  when a bull breeds a cow, you know, they can dump two to 400 units in a cow. Okay. And  then when you go to AI, you're only using one unit. But the only difference is is that  
**[0:54:33-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:54:33):**  the bull is depositing his semen before the cervix. And you're depositing that one straw  on the other side of the cervix where the fertilization everything will be where probably  90% of them would get passed anyway. Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:54:47-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:54:47):**  Just given a little bit, giving them a better chance.  Yep. Yep. And we tried I mean, I've been AIing since since it started. And it's really helped  my herd.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:55:01):**  Okay, so how many different ways? I let me back up. I know there's different ways to  AI, like, you know, you can synchronize, you can flush, there's also like, an option that  uses less horror that you don't have to like flush them and synchronize them and and use  
**[0:55:18-0:55:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:55:18):**  a bunch of hormones. Can you talk about the those two different ways?  Are you talking about like IVF in vitro fertilization? Because that's that I think that's what you're  talking about.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:55:28):**  I what I think I'm talking about is, is instead of bringing, bringing them in, and putting  the hormones in them to get them to sync up to where you can come back in a certain time  and hit them all with, you know, with the straws. Yeah, versus watching them and be  
**[0:55:46-0:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:55:46):**  like, she's ready, and then grabbing her and running around.  Yeah. So like, what the natural heat is what you're saying just natural heat and you take  the signs off that. And let's say, you know, standing heat, for anyone who doesn't know,  
**[0:55:59-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:55:59):**  it's so if you get if you have a cow that's showing signs of heat, first thing in the  morning, and another cow is riding her, and she's letting the cow ride her the same as  if it was a bull, if that was a bull jumping her and she's not running away, then she's  
**[0:56:14-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:56:14):**  ready to breed. Right? So it would be the same, except the difference is, whenever you  see a cow in standing heat, you'll AI 12 hours later. So it's like the ampm rule, if a cow  is standing in standing first thing in the morning, you'll AI in the afternoon or vice  
**[0:56:32-0:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:56:32):**  versa, if she's standing in the evening, you breed first thing in the morning. And then  you, we do it just because it's I mean, it costs maybe less than $2 per head just because  we don't have that many cattle will give sister Ellen, whenever we AI, you know, what's that?  
**[0:56:52-0:57:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:56:52):**  That is a GnRH it's a gonadotropin releasing hormone. It's one of the hormones that you'll  give if you whenever it comes to AI, and all that. Okay, what is it in English? gonadotropin  releasing hormone is what it's called. Okay, so what does it do? It releases gonadotropin?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:57:14):**  It releases gonadotropin. Gosh, I hope I'm not saying the wrong terms here. What I'm  asking is like what biological function is it modifying? It helps release the egg, release  the follicle, that's what it does. And but the cows already supposed to do that, if she's  
**[0:57:31-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:57:31):**  in a natural heat, she'll already do that. It's just kind of a assurance just in case  if you're not AI at the right time, because the reason you do that, the reason you do  that is because the egg will be released later on from their standing heat. And the semen  
**[0:57:49-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:57:49):**  when you deposit it also has to mature inside the cow as well. And I believe that takes  about five hours for the for the sperm cells to mature in the cow as well.  Okay,  
**[0:58:01-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:58:01):**  after after it's been deposited. So it's just that little timeframe that you have to go  on. Now I have AI on standing heat, and given them cis-relin and it's worked just fine.  I was thinking about doing a little experiment, excuse me, this fall, trying that a little  
**[0:58:20-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:58:20):**  bit and see if I can impregnate them on a standing heat. Or if it works better, you  know, 12 hours later, for me personally, heifers. And I've heard a lot of people agree with  this that heifers are easier to AI on a natural heat, rather than putting them through protocol,  
**[0:58:40-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:58:40):**  which the protocol we use, it's a 10 day fixed time protocol where on day zero will insert  a cedar, which is a prostaglandin implant. It looks like a T.  CIDR, right?  
**[0:58:56-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:58:56):**  Correct. It looks like a T, you'll insert it and we'll leave it in there for a week.  It releases prostaglandin, which is it's one of the hormones that the cow produces. It  helps.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:59:10):**  It's a female pregnancy fertility hormone.  It helps retain pregnancy also. Okay. But whenever you do that, you'll also give cis-relin,  which is that that hormone I was talking to make it release the egg. Yeah. But what that'll  
**[0:59:24-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:59:24):**  do also, it helps clear any, if she's cystic also, if she has cysts on her ovaries, that'll  help clear it as well. So on day zero, you'll insert the cedar and give the cicer-relin.  On day seven at 5 PM, we will take the cedar out and give them a shot of lutalyse, which  
**[0:59:48-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=0:59:48):**  is, oh gosh, the word just slipped my mind, but that is the hormone that helps them come  into heat.  Okay. Regulates cycle.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:00:03):**  I said prostaglandin, GnRH, I'll think of the name after.  I'm sure if you're wrong, I'm sure if you've said something wrong, I will get plenty of  hate mail. If you've said something, probably I'm embarrassed that I could, I guess I'd  
**[1:00:22-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:00:22):**  say this verbatim all the time. They'll email me, not you.  And so, and then you'll do that. And so with that protocol, that's a fixed time. So, uh,  60 to 66 hours after you gave that shot, the lutalyse. Correct. Okay. After you give that  
**[1:00:41-1:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:00:41):**  shot, then you can AI in that span of time. However, if there are cows that show signs  of standing heat, breed those cows based on that heat. So whatever cows don't come into  heat, you'll AI in that span of time.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:00:57):**  Okay. So during that seven days after you do the, the, the, the Cedar and the Cedar  pull, you've got that seven, you said seven days and then you do the lutalyse and then  it's 60 to 60 to 66 hours. You said.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:01:14):**  Yes, that you'll, that you'll fix time. So you got like 12 days in there that you're  watching for standing heats or just, okay. Yeah. So it's like three days. So after you  give the lutalyse, so all non-responders you'll AI in that little timeframe and you'll give  
**[1:01:33-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:01:33):**  them a shot of sister Ellen. And that's how you, you make up for the, um, to make it a  fixed time. So like their hormones are all set up. They may not have shown signs of standing  heat, but then once you reach that 60 to 66 hours, you can go ahead and AI them and give  
**[1:01:50-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:01:50):**  them that shot. And it'll hopefully make them release the follicle and you can AI then.  And so then that, and then from that point, uh, 10 days later, I'll put the bull in and  then whatever, whatever calves are born, whatever, um, you know, span of time after all those  
**[1:02:12-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:02:12):**  AI calves. And after that's just from natural.  Then you know. Yeah. Yeah. So on your cleanup bulls, cause I'm sure somebody will ask on  your cleanup bulls, what's your bull to cow ratio.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:02:26):**  Well, I have a small heart. So last and also a lot of power then. So I had three bulls.  Um, like I had one bull with the majority and he had, he had 25 cows with him. Uh, my  other bull who was, uh, he was 13 months. So I only put him with five. I he's my favorite  
**[1:02:50-1:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:02:50):**  bull. And I just, I didn't want to overdo him or anything being a 13 month old bull.  So I just put him with five, maybe six cows. And then another group that he fit with. Yeah.  Yeah. And then another bull had, I believe 10, but it was just more, some of the cows  
**[1:03:07-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:03:07):**  can't breed those bulls because it's their sire or their maternal brothers or right.  And well, isn't that called line breeding when it works?  It's line breeding when it works. And it's, uh, inbreeding when it doesn't, but I mean,  
**[1:03:25-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:03:25):**  we don't, we don't have any carriers that we know of in our herd for any defects. So  it's not nothing really that I'm too concerned about. Um, I don't know if you ever heard  of this, the old fashioned way to find out if a, if an animal is a carrier for genetic  
**[1:03:44-1:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:03:44):**  defect.  Uh, well first tell me what like genetic defects we're talking about and then, then tell me  that, tell me all the old timers did it.  
**[1:03:52-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:03:52):**  There's a few that I, some of them, I don't even know if they should be considered defects  in the way that they, you know, stamp them as a carrier for it. There's some, there's  a developmental duplication, which if you've seen before, it'd be like the, the cap, the  
**[1:04:07-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:04:07):**  calf with two legs sticking out of its head. Yeah. That kind of deal. That's developmental  duplication. There was a, those don't sell very well at the barn at all. No, there's,  it's been said that it's due to a twin. Maybe the calf was with a twin, but come to find  
**[1:04:25-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:04:25):**  out it's actually a recessive, uh, trait. It's a recessive, recessive genetic defect  that the Angus carry. And then there's also ones there's, um, curly calf syndrome. There's  nine total that you'll, that you'll test for. And well, the old fashioned way that they  
**[1:04:47-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:04:47):**  did it, I don't remember exactly if it's 34 or 35, but you get 35 daughters out of a bowl  and have that bowl breed all 30, all, all 35 of his daughters in one breeding season.  Like in one go, he breeds all 35 of them. And if all the calves don't have defects,  
**[1:05:06-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:05:06):**  then he's defect free. Could be 36.  I mean, I, I, the math works. Yeah. I mean, is the statistics, the probability, I mean,  the math works, but I don't know if that would really make sense a lot of times, but if that's,  
**[1:05:22-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:05:22):**  if that's the only tool you have, that's the tool you use.  Yeah. And you know, there's, there's Angus pedigrees. You can find, you can find bulls  in there that go back 600 times.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:05:34):**  Wow.  Yeah. 600, you know, I've, I've had animals that'll go back to a bowl a hundred, 200 times  sometimes.  
**[1:05:42-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:05:42):**  Okay. Great. I feel like you've kind of explained AI at least enough that either I understand  it or my brain's still full. I can't think of any more questions about AI right now.  So I did have over the last couple of weeks since we recorded the last one, well, the  
**[1:06:01-1:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:06:01):**  last few days, I've had a couple of questions come in and came up with a couple of my own.  I think we did kind of answer this in the last episode, but what are cattle worth in  Brazil compared to here?  
**[1:06:14-1:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:06:14):**  At the, like in Selborn?  Yeah.  Same.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:06:18):**  So roughly equivalent.  Yeah. If you do the conversion, cause right now it's, it's 19 us cents to one Brazilian  hayal, which is like the dollar, the Brazilian dollar. So it's, you'll see the prices like  
**[1:06:35-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:06:35):**  it might say, um, you know, $50 for a straw, but it's, it's whatever the conversion is.  So it, regardless, it will be a lot cheaper here in the U S but yeah, right now prices  are the exact same pretty much. And it's, they are more controlled by JBS and what we  
**[1:06:57-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:06:57):**  are at least.  I know JBS, does JBS pretty much just tell everybody what they're going to do in Brazil  as far as  
**[1:07:06-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:07:06):**  When you own the whole market, pretty much, you just say, Hey, this is what we want. When  you own the whole market, it's like, well, if we don't do it, then we're not, you know,  falling behind pretty much.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:07:16):**  I mean, I don't want to get sued, but like, is there, is there literally any other player  in Brazil other than JBS?  That I don't know. I, I'm not too sure on that. When I went,  
**[1:07:29-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:07:29):**  They're just so big they're everywhere.  Yeah. Well, when I went on that trip just now we passed five slaughter plants. Uh, we  passed one that was for cattle or maybe four, but one for cattle, one for pork, one for  
**[1:07:42-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:07:42):**  poultry and another one. I, I, I think it was another cattle one actually.  Wow. Yeah.  So one, one of the things that, uh, we really didn't cover last time was like the forage  
**[1:07:58-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:07:58):**  chain and feeding cycle, not necessarily for cow calf operations, but say for like a finishing  type operation.  Um, so like, what, what, what can you talk about? Like the forage chain that they run  
**[1:08:13-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:08:13):**  their cows and calves on, you know, the production herd versus what they run the finishing and,  um, and production herds on or the, the, the, the herd they're going to finish that they're  going to the barn.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:08:24):**  Uh, you mean, uh, like silage that's pretty, I mean, primarily what they they're going  to feed is just silage.  Okay.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:08:33):**  Like, and like as a finish ration.  Yeah. Yeah. That's a finish ration pretty much.  So corn silage and grain TMR, just pretty much like we do here.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:08:43):**  Yep. Yep. So pretty much.  What about the cows? Like how are the cows raised? And, and, you know, we can kind of  preface it like in this country, there's kind of, you know, two systems there's, there's  
**[1:08:55-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:08:55):**  what I do and guys north of me do that, you know, try to pasture all year and, you know,  feed hay, feed protein into pasture. And there's guys that pasture the cows for  about six months and then put them in a dry lot and feed them a ration the other six.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:09:09):**  The first that's, that's pretty well, cause there, they don't have winter like we do up  north where it's a, you know, they'll have green grass in the winter there, but they're  not going to have however many, excuse me, feet of snow. That's gonna, that they have  
**[1:09:27-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:09:27):**  to corral them. And cause even in the winter there, they'll have green pastures, tall green  passion and the cattle there are going to be frame here. And the only reason for that  is because of how tall their grass is. They need cattle that are a little bit taller.  
**[1:09:45-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:09:45):**  If you have those like your cattle or just short, the Pharaoh cattle, short, stocky cattle,  you're going to get, start getting so many problems on their under bellies. Cause they're  just, their bellies are dragging the grass the entire time and ticks are really bad too  
**[1:10:02-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:10:02):**  down there. So, I mean the cattle, like they're not going to heck, they may weigh about the  same, you know, thousand, 1200, thousand and 1200 pound cows, but their legs are, you know,  they're a lot like drags. Yeah. Yeah.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:10:17):**  That makes sense. And you know, it also makes sense why they like a lot of indicus and the  Lori blood down there is because of the, of the pest resistance, the tick resistance.  Angus, there, there was a semen collection facility that we went to and the Angus that  
**[1:10:34-1:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:10:34):**  were imported from the U S to there, some of them just looked like crap because just  in the little lots there, the ticks were so bad that they had to clean them off every  single day. I worked at a ranch there once and he would run Simmental bulls on his Nalori  
**[1:10:51-1:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:10:51):**  cows. He had an embryo transfer facility. So he would run Simmental bulls on the Nalori  cows and use those recess, those daughters as a recess, the Simmental bulls would start  getting ticks on their neck and on their butt. And then the flies would get in and start  
**[1:11:09-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:11:09):**  leaving their larva in the neck. And they would, they'd have this purple medicine that  they would just go and spray on the neck and you know, just the smell of death and decay  coming off and just maggots would start pouring out of their necks because of the initial  
**[1:11:26-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:11:26):**  tick infection, turned into a fly infection, then infested with maggots. And the Nalori  would never get it, but only Simmental, Angus, any Bostars kinds of breeds wreak havoc on  them.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:11:42):**  Interesting. So, I mean, in addition to having, you know, the Naloris, which are, you know,  a little more resistant to the ticks, what else, what else do they do down there for  tick control? Because here, what guys would do is, you know, they'd go get the saber,  
**[1:11:56-1:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:11:56):**  the siddectin and, you know, God forbid, ivermectin and drench their cows. And that would solve  the problem here, you know, with ticks and flies. How do they do it down there?  Same pretty much. They might have some other ingredients or whatever that they use that  
**[1:12:14-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:12:14):**  they can use that we are not allowed to here. There's a lot of, most, it seems like most  other countries have a lot less restrictions when it comes to the hormones or whatever  kind of pest control products that we can use on our cattle, on our pastures than we  
**[1:12:33-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:12:33):**  do here. But I think genetics plays the biggest because the ticks are so bad. I think at the  end of the day has to be genetics that saves them.  I think like everything, well, I saw some of your videos, you know, there's dip vats  
**[1:12:52-1:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:12:52):**  and I would assume that, you know, they're going in those dip vats.  And they, yeah, they do have that as well. Yeah.  And that'd be, that'd be for, for pest control. Yeah. And I guess I'm sitting here and I'm  
**[1:13:05-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:13:05):**  thinking of the story Alan Savory tells in, I think it's Holistic Management, third edition  about the tsetse fly areas in Africa. How that, you know, they had to have, they constructed  these big dip vats that they'd run all the cattle through. They tried quarantining these  
**[1:13:25-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:13:25):**  areas. They tried pulling the cows out. They tried burning it. They tried doing everything  and they couldn't control the tsetse flies. Like the more things they tried, the worse  they got. Yeah. And I can't remember what they ended up doing, but you know, it's, no  
**[1:13:39-1:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:13:39):**  one Alan Savory is probably some, you know, Holistic Adaptive Plan grazing the way they,  the way they started using those tsetse fly areas. And the problem got to be not as bad.  There you go. You know, so I think that I'm thinking about,  
**[1:13:53-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:13:53):**  you know, okay, yeah, we've got, we got a, we have a, we have a problem with ticks in  Brazil. Okay. The solution is not more and more chemicals, more and more toxic chemicals  because nature will find a way to evolve and do an end run around that toxicity. And I  
**[1:14:11-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:14:11):**  think, you know, a lot of us can agree that, you know, we sprayed so much toxic chemicals,  so much that we don't know everything that we've killed. Like we may have killed off  15 beneficial species with that chemical trying to control the one that it barely affects.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:14:31):**  And like others, I had a conversation about fungicide lately. Like, have we sprayed so  much fungicide in the world that we've eradicated the, the good fungus that's really susceptible  to those kinds of chemicals in order to kill the bad stuff that takes a high concentration  
**[1:14:54-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:14:54):**  of it. You know, have we eliminated so many of the good ones that that's all that's left  is the bad ones that are expressing themselves. And we have to like continue to have, you  know, increases exponentially in the order of toxicity in our antibiotics to fight these  
**[1:15:09-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:15:09):**  organisms.  At the end of the day, nature wins. Whatever you do to try and fight nature, it's going  to come back in some form or fashion to hurt you another way. You may or you know, you  
**[1:15:23-1:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:15:23):**  may get rid of a problem over here, but it's got to, it's going to get filled up somewhere  else. And it's like you said, well, we got to get rid of this weed over here. Well, in  order to do that, you have to kill all these other beneficial plants. And then what's that  
**[1:15:39-1:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:15:39):**  going to do? Well, it's going to hurt your soil, it's going to do this and that. And  so I think going forward, if most, if not all producers at least started trying to implement  more regenerative, or at least ways that working with nature on your operation rather than  
**[1:16:04-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:16:04):**  working against it, I mean, it's gonna it'll, it'll probably it could hurt your operation,  not maybe profit, per se. But it's going to end up helping our the entire world.  Yeah, rising tide lifts all boats.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:16:24):**  Yeah, yeah. I got my words mixed up there.  So, so since we last talked, you've obviously, it seems like you've done some thinking. What  are you going to be taking any steps towards a more regenerative ranch in the near future?  
**[1:16:41-1:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:16:41):**  That's why I'm trying. My dad, I don't I don't think this is true. He probably heard it from  one of his friends, you know, boomer FaceTalk, or Facebook kind of memes. It was something  about California banned fertilizers, or is going to ban fertilizers. I don't know if  
**[1:17:00-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:17:00):**  that's true. And I tried googling, I didn't find anything. But just him hearing that he  was like, Yeah, we have to make sure that we're, we can at least function and stuff,  you know, without fertilizers and stuff like finally, thank you for listening. It took  
**[1:17:14-1:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:17:14):**  somebody else for you to catch on. That's usually how it works. But  it only took the price doubling in six months, and somebody else saying it for you to listen.  Thanks, Dan.  
**[1:17:23-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:17:23):**  Yeah. It's I, I want to keep doing this, I don't want to stop. But I think in if I end  up quitting the cattle, it's because I didn't manage everything correctly. And I don't want  to have an operation where I'm so dependent on input, I'm going to have inputs. It's not,  
**[1:17:43-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:17:43):**  you know, I'm not saying that I'm not going to have inputs. But the less inputs I have,  being able to still produce the same kind of product. I mean that you can't, you can't  argue that you can't go against that. And I have grown up in a system where it's, oh,  
**[1:18:01-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:18:01):**  well, you have 100 acres around the cows, well, you have to run as many cows as you  can, you know, just give them feed, give them this given that well, then I have genetics  that are surrounded around all this high input. And now I'm screwed now have to get rid of  
**[1:18:14-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:18:14):**  cows. Well, I shouldn't have had to have done that in the beginning, if I had to maintain  this the entire time, I wouldn't have a problem. And so at least on some of the pastures, I'm  going to try and recuperate them, plant more legumes in them, and try and help the soil  
**[1:18:34-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:18:34):**  more. So that way I don't, I don't have to feed as much hay, I'm, I'm still going to  be bailing and making hay because in the winter, our small operation, it's I have cattle in  every paddock, I have cat something in every pin. And so first off, I need to decrease  
**[1:18:53-1:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:18:53):**  the amount of cattle that I have, because I have to keep some separate have to keep  certain bulls away from Yeah, for sure, you know, from my small seedstock operation. So  first off, I need to get rid of a few. So far, I've called all the bad ones. And now  
**[1:19:07-1:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:19:07):**  the all that I have left is one set, I don't need them. But they can go to someone and  do a really good job for someone else. But for what I want, I can get rid of them. And  it just so happens that all the ones that I'm wanting to get rid of all had heifers  
**[1:19:24-1:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:19:24):**  on their side. Well, now I got to keep you for a little longer. But at least now that  I have daughters out of them, I can, I'm comfortable getting rid of them.  Nothing makes me happier than a heifer calf. Oh, yeah, I definitely new babies are always  
**[1:19:41-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:19:41):**  great. But it's always so much better when it's a heifer. Not a bull.  There's certain animals that I want to bull out of because I still have my dreams of raising  an AI sire raising a bull that everyone wants to use. So I'm still trying to tackle that,  
**[1:19:55-1:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:19:55):**  you know, but there are certain animals that I want, that I'll want a female out of other  ones that, you know, I want a bull. But I tried to make every cross that I make with  him with the idea of, well, if I get a female, I want the best female that I can, if I get  
**[1:20:12-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:20:12):**  a bull, it's going to be fine, because I'm using the genetics of good bulls. However,  I want to make the best female I can. And so if I even if I get a bull out of that cross,  to me, it's well, that'll be a bull that's maternally made. He he'll at least have the  
**[1:20:29-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:20:29):**  genetics to produce good maternal quality. So, so far, that's done pretty well for me.  At least keeping that in mind.  That makes sense. And you know, like, like the guys at Noble, they added the sixth principle  
**[1:20:44-1:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:20:44):**  as well, know your context and know your context, you know, what what works for me won't necessarily  work 100% for you. And, you know, the conversation we've been having about, you know, what is  regenerative agriculture? Well, it's not a destination. It's a journey. Yeah. And we're  
**[1:21:08-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:21:08):**  all starting at a different place. And no matter where you are on your journey of regenerative  agriculture and soil health, you're there. You've at least started asking questions you  you listeners are, you know, at least starting by listening to this podcast, whatever that's  
**[1:21:23-1:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:21:23):**  called. And it's kind of leads into a discussion I want to have about, you know, some of the  dissension and division that we're experiencing in agriculture right now, you know. And I  don't like to put things in terms of winners and losers or contest because we can all win.  
**[1:21:47-1:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:21:47):**  We can also all frickin lose big. But we've got to work together. And, you know, there's  a lot of dissension. And I think the big difference I find between somebody that's stuck in a  conventional mindset and stuck in that program versus somebody that's on a regenerative side  
**[1:22:07-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:22:07):**  is the guys that are on the regenerative side. What sets them apart is not where you are  in the journey. It's the commitment to be a lifelong learner and the understanding that  the things that we have learned and have the practices that we have been applying for the  
**[1:22:24-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:22:24):**  last, I don't know, 60 plus years are quite possibly flawed. And we can do better.  That's and that's the biggest point is we can do better. There's a lot of people that  get really upset. Like, oh, those region guys, and it will never work. And so it's not that  
**[1:22:44-1:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:22:44):**  it won't work is that every I think I think everybody should implement some type of regenerative  practice as something that helps the soil without artificial meat by not by artificial  means. Right. I think every operation at least has that duty to the land to the earth to  
**[1:23:07-1:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:23:07):**  do that. And I think ridicule of those kinds of practices. Some I think ridicule sometimes  is the best means of being able to finally get it in people's mind of why you're the  way you're doing something is kind of silly. There's always a better way. If it's not just  
**[1:23:29-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:23:29):**  a better way. It's also a more healthy way for for your land for your soil for your animals.  And being able to push the buttons on those kinds of people that are completely against  it. I think over time is going to start opening some eyes some more. There's probably some  
**[1:23:53-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:23:53):**  means that maybe a little too harsh sometimes on how some of them conduct themselves, even  me, I've caught myself doing it. And at the end of the day, I think what's the most important  is the ag industry and trying to make sure that it is successful for everyone. And not  
**[1:24:17-1:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:24:17):**  just successful for everyone, but at least not an abusive means on on the land and on  the animals. Because to an extent, you know, overgrazing the conventional way it is, it's  abusive to the land. It's abusive also to the animals. You know, the feedlots. I just,  
**[1:24:42-1:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:24:42):**  I don't really like looking at feedlots. I don't like seeing the animals cooped up like  that pinned together. You know, personally, I just I don't think that that's how it's  it's awful hard for me to drive down us 54 through the panhandles down in the New Mexico  
**[1:25:00-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:25:00):**  or even highway 400 through western Kansas, you know, out around Garden City, Dodge City.  It's just it's feedlot after feedlot after feedlot, then the big Tyson plant and then  feedlot feedlot feedlot feedlot. You go down 54 and it's like they just might as well rename  
**[1:25:16-1:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:25:16):**  that the JBS highway because it's JBS and five rivers for like 200 miles down there.  Yeah, and I just I don't like looking at it. I think there needs to be a lot more because  it's not necessarily efficient for us. It's it's what's efficient for them. Right. And  
**[1:25:34-1:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:25:34):**  so what we were talking about carcass size earlier. Yeah. Small cows make the cattleman  money.  Yeah, that's efficient for us. But it's not efficient for them. That's not what makes  
**[1:25:45-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:25:45):**  them well, big carcasses make them money. Yeah. But then you get them too big and you  get discounted. Yeah, it has to be just right. It has to be just right for our for our conveyor  belts and everything and fair conveyor our conveyors the height the chain is off the  
**[1:26:00-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:26:00):**  ground for the for the one cut. We've trained all 3000 guys to make, you know, 6000 times  a day. I think that's there's a point where efficiencies of scale loses, loses sight and  loses touch with the ecological and the human cost. I mean, for as much as much crap as  
**[1:26:28-1:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:26:28):**  we can talk about feedlots like I get they're bad, they're gross, they're ugly. Working  conditions in a packing plant. Living conditions. Yeah. Come on, like, do you want to go live  there? I wouldn't know. Well, and that's why the people that are there are there. Because  
**[1:26:49-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:26:49):**  they will do that job and live there for that pay and that opportunity.  You know, in that there's just there's so much into it. And how do you get out of it?  As a as a as a system as a whole? You know, it's kind of, to me, it's not going anywhere.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:27:14):**  I don't think it's it's something that's no,  no, no matter how much Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren wish, wish they could, they are not  going to ban feedlots. Feedlots are not going to empty out in the next two years by any  
**[1:27:29-1:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:27:29):**  sort of governmental pressure. Yeah, could be completely wrong. But I'm just saying that  the meat lobby is way too powerful to let that happen.  Yeah. And so at this point, it's those of us that would just want to take it back into  
**[1:27:47-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:27:47):**  our own hands, put it back into the people into the producers into into what the way  it's supposed to be and not just a factory made factory kind of product.  Yeah. I totally appreciate Mike Carla Craig. I really enjoy that guy. I really enjoy talking  
**[1:28:07-1:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:28:07):**  to him, enjoy his mind. And I've talked to him enough. We can't, we're not going to beat  Tyson Cargill, JBS and Marford. We are not going to beat them. We can go to Supreme Court  with an airtight case and we're not going to win. Like period. The only way that we're  
**[1:28:27-1:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:28:27):**  going to do anything different in our industry is to not play their game anymore. And that  means inventing a different game. I mean, that means that means making that means a  lot of guys have to make a change. You know, me, you, probably most of the people listen  
**[1:28:46-1:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:28:46):**  to us, we got to make some changes in our business to be more profitable. I mean, I  don't know about you. I don't know what the Weather Service is saying. For you for next  year, client prediction center. They're saying Loonina is going to go three. They're saying  
**[1:29:04-1:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:29:04):**  triple dip Loonina, which means more of the same weather pattern we've had for the last  two years.  I mean, I've heard. I've heard that it's supposed to lift by February. Well, that's what I heard  
**[1:29:17-1:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:29:17):**  at least. So I don't know, I'm just, I'm still trying to work towards hoping that the that  it's going to lift by February. That's just kind of how I'm pushing, planting and stuff  right now. So hopefully next year, I'll be able to do this kind of crop this kind of  
**[1:29:36-1:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:29:36):**  crop. And but man, if it's another year like that, though, it's, it's gonna be ugly. It's  not gonna be it's not gonna be pretty.  Yeah, okay, that, that one TikTok you sent me the other day. I can't get that out of  
**[1:29:57-1:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:29:57):**  my head. I've been thinking about that, like for the last two days.  Which one was it?  The one that the one that's down in southern Oklahoma, southeast Oklahoma that said there  
**[1:30:08-1:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:30:08):**  were 100 150 bales short of hay. I know that we could be talking about 800 pound four by  four or 1600 pound five by five.  Yeah, okay. I don't think it's square bales.  
**[1:30:21-1:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:30:21):**  No. So because a 1600 pound round five by five, that's what grocks in my brain. And  I do that math real quick. Okay. And you know, it works out to like that was 6000 cow days  worth of food that they're short. Yeah. 6000 cow and you got to get to the first of May.  
**[1:30:43-1:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:30:43):**  Like it's only like 5060 cows that they're that they got to feed. Like it wasn't that  many that they're short. Like it but it didn't seem like a large number to me of what they're  going to be of how many head that they needed to feed all winter. Does that make sense?  
**[1:31:00-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:31:00):**  Yeah. And that's what and I had asked, you know, how many head are y'all running because  150 bales is  that's not much. That's not much. It's either it's either all the hay in the world to a  
**[1:31:14-1:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:31:14):**  guy that has five in the backyard, or it's nothing to a guy that's got 1000 on pasture.  And you know, did how did they prepare for this point? Because there was a lot of hay  for sale. Last year, there's been hay for sale everywhere. There was hay for sale in  
**[1:31:30-1:31:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:31:30):**  Oklahoma, I could have trucked down from like two and a half, three hours away. And it would  have cost a pretty penny, but it all the hay was there. So right now, if I you know, if  we haven't prepared for the worst, or we have an operation set up for failure like this,  
**[1:31:51-1:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:31:51):**  it's it's just going to keep getting worse.  I, I, there's almost nothing that I can say on that. Other than you're overstocked, take  some fucking cows to town.  
**[1:32:02-1:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:32:02):**  Yeah. And, you know, this particular one, it doesn't really seem like it's a, I think  it's like a first generation operation. And they're, you know, they just want to have  a ranch, they want to have cows, they want to have the chickens. And I want everyone  
**[1:32:16-1:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:32:16):**  to have that. But you have to realize that it's not just, I want cows. It's not charity.  You know, it's Yeah, there's no reason for any kind of GoFundMe, I think to be set up  for anyone that's that hasn't prepared themselves.  
**[1:32:30-1:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:32:30):**  And that's what I see people doing. That's what's really gonna piss me off if I see this  fall and winter is I see big operations, big cow calf operations, start posting GoFundMe  ease to get to get people to send them money so they can go buy overpriced hay because  
**[1:32:48-1:33:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:32:48):**  they failed to plan. Well, piss me off even more than that is if the government steps  in and starts giving those people subsidies and handouts for their poor fucking planning  and lack of preparation. And those will be the people that will laugh at somebody like  
**[1:33:04-1:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:33:04):**  me that grazes year round and talk shit on my cattle. Like go ahead, take that government  handout to stay in business. And then tell me how bad of an operator I am.  If, if I have to take cows to sell barns still because I wasn't prepared enough. I mean,  
**[1:33:19-1:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:33:19):**  that's, that's on me, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be like, Hey, can you help me out,  please? Can y'all, you know, donate to my GoFundMe I don't want to get rid of my cows.  Or dear, dear government, help me save my cows, help me find some hay for my cows so  
**[1:33:35-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:33:35):**  they don't starve to death.  Leave the GoFundMe for you know, the kids that got sick all of a sudden stuff like that,  that you can't help, but stuff that you can help that you should have prepared for, you  
**[1:33:46-1:34:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:33:46):**  know, and from that TikTok, you can see the pastures. I mean, you know, it's a drought  and now in here, it's, it's tough to really keep after your pastures, but it was dirt.  It was just dirt. And I mean, I'm super dry, but just having off part of the pasture, letting  
**[1:34:05-1:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:34:05):**  that grow up, let the cows go hit that have hay on the other side. And the one where they're  hit it enough, bring them back over, fence it back off and just do something at least  just do one little thing like that. That's all at least.  
**[1:34:18-1:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:34:18):**  Just split it in half, just split it in half and rest half of it. Yeah. Like you don't  have to move them every damn day. You don't have to move them every week. Just split it  up and let part of it rest for a little bit. And you're, you're right. Like in the background,  
**[1:34:37-1:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:34:37):**  I've only, I only watched it like the whole way through one time. Yeah. Me too. Because  it's just, it's just hard to listen to. Like if you, if people knew where to look, if people  actually would look, these drought indications have been there for two years. Yeah. They  
**[1:34:55-1:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:34:55):**  were there. I mean, nine months ago in the spring, the climate prediction center, the  national drought mitigation center, even national weather service, they're all saying it's probably  going to be dry in the great plains this year. Yeah. And he had gone and nobody listened.  
**[1:35:13-1:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:35:13):**  Nope. Everybody has faith. Oh, it'll rain. Oh, it'll rain. You know, God will provide.  No, that's not how, that's not how it works. You know, you don't, it's like, it's, I know  it's bad, but can you please know, like, this is the way it was going to be to begin with.  
**[1:35:33-1:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:35:33):**  Nobody knew. We've been saying it and I wish I had prepared a lot more than what I did  still. I'm fine, but right now I'm just, I just need to prepare for each time that we  do have rain and at least just prepare for a year in advance. And I think that's a problem  
**[1:35:53-1:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:35:53):**  a lot of producers don't do is look in advance of, well, if we're in a drought this part  next year, I need to make sure I'm doing this right now to save me then. And that was something  I didn't do before. I wish I had bought, Hey, 70, $80 a bell whenever, when it was available  
**[1:36:11-1:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:36:11):**  like that. I was like, nah, we'll, we'll be fine. No. And then when it got to a hundred,  I was like, yeah, I need, I need to do it now. Maybe I should have bought that a couple  of weeks ago. You know, cause I mean, even our pastures, because our hay pastures, we  
**[1:36:25-1:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:36:25):**  have one, well, we try to make horse quality hay for, for our horses, right? For us, it's  in the long run. It's we found it to be, I won't say cheaper, but it is more efficient  for us to be able to bail all of our hay whenever we want, instead of depending on someone else  
**[1:36:44-1:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:36:44):**  to do it as well as instead of importing alfalfa. Right. Cause we, you know, we'll feed 30  because your parents are, your parents are still doing the reining horse thing. Yeah.  So they probably want some really, really good feed.  
**[1:37:01-1:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:37:01):**  Well, and what's good about the coastal that we bail it's horse quality. We keep it up  in the barn and all we do instead of feeling feeding alfalfa, we just take a bail down,  open it up with the flat side on the ground and just pull it off, put it on a little trailer,  
**[1:37:17-1:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:37:17):**  feed all the horses. And I've saved my mom so much money compared to paying for all the  alfalfa that we would need to spend. And I have all perfectly good hay and the horses  look great on it. And so, and, and then from that, whatever else I have is for the cows.  
**[1:37:33-1:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:37:33):**  So that's the benefit on that. And at least, you know, one, one thing I notice also is  that people complain so much about the prices on hay. Oh, it's $120 a bale, $150 a bale.  You know, whenever, whenever cattle prices were good, you know, people weren't complaining  
**[1:37:54-1:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:37:54):**  about how, you know, how much a bull was and everything. Well, another thing that people,  I think, forget to realize that if you have to feed hay, the more, the better quality  hay you have, the less you have to supplement. If you have $120 hay and it's really good  
**[1:38:12-1:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:38:12):**  quality hay, you don't have to have any supplement there. All that supplements right there in  the hay, it's in the grass that your cows are eating. So you're, you're saving money.  But then if you go cheaper, get $80 hay that they don't want to eat that much. Well, then  
**[1:38:25-1:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:38:25):**  you have to supplement them with feed or cake or tubs. And then there's more, more cost  right there.  Speaking of tubs, I think I'm about ready to go get a couple pallets. Just, I don't  
**[1:38:39-1:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:38:39):**  want to spend the money. Like I don't even really want to spend the money buying alfalfa,  but like, I think I'm going to be one, one truckload of alfalfa and probably three, maybe  four pallets of tubs should get me all winter. And that's feeding from probably November  
**[1:38:56-1:39:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:38:56):**  15 to around April 15 on the, on the alfalfa.  November to April, you said? Is that what you said?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And well, you know, I'm the low input weirdo in the area. So like,  
**[1:39:09-1:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:39:09):**  I'm not saying like my good manager neighbors are not hauling hay. Like their hay yards  are like filling up. But they are caking. The guys that aren't quite as good managers  that have 16, 1800 pound cows. Yeah. Yeah. They've been feeding for a while and they're,  
**[1:39:29-1:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:39:29):**  you know, they're pushing three, four pounds a head a day of 30 to 40% cake. I don't know  how anybody can afford to feed more than two pounds a day of cake.  There's a, there's a gentleman near me just down the road and he, you know, he has what  
**[1:39:45-1:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:39:45):**  could be a perfect operation. He has all the implements he needs. He has two great big  feed bins and he feeds the grain to his cows and his cows just, they're just all crossbred  and they're all skinny and they still have to get fed grain. And I just, I can't imagine  
**[1:40:05-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:40:05):**  what, where the profit is if they're just selling to the sale barn. And it's not just  black calves or calves that are colored all over them and have all different kinds of,  there's no consistency. So, you know, how much money are they spending right now on  
**[1:40:20-1:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:40:20):**  all this feed for the cows? Some of my cows I'm feeding right now just to give them that  extra, the extra energy requirements they need to go on the corn stalks or something.  But then once they have the good hay, they're not getting anything because that hay is going  
**[1:40:35-1:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:40:35):**  to provide everything they need and, or it's supposed to. And if, if they can't even handle  themselves on good hay, you know, they got to go.  They got to go find another job.  
**[1:40:47-1:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:40:47):**  Yep. And right now I think with, with everything that's going on, you know, with the weather  and inputs and everything, the kind of cattle that are really going to take a hit are going  to be these EPD oriented Angus at least. They're really going to be taking a hit because there's  
**[1:41:04-1:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:41:04):**  no way that all these producers.  The high input genetics.  Yeah.  
**[1:41:07-1:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:41:07):**  I mean, whether, whether we're talking about high inputs, as far as, you know, high inputs  as feed high inputs with, you know, hormones, ion pours. Yeah.  A lot of times those kinds of guys, those kinds of people already have, they can pay  
**[1:41:24-1:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:41:24):**  for that feed and not hurt, you know? So that's the problem. When you get those kinds of people  that just have enough money to do whatever they want with it. Well, they're just going  to continue a problem that is actually harmful in the long run, you know, continuing these  
**[1:41:39-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:41:39):**  genetics that just don't, aren't going to perform out in the pasture like they should.  And I said this a while back and I, some people had gotten mad at me. I don't, I didn't really  think it was that big of a deal, but with the amount of cows that we've had go to the  
**[1:41:57-1:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:41:57):**  sale barn, to me, I called it kind of like a great culling. We had so many go, well,  the majority of those cows, what are they going to be? They're going to be probably  the cows that are bad genetics. They're going to be all the cows that were infertile, bad  
**[1:42:12-1:42:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:42:12):**  calving intervals, couldn't keep up. They're the ones that got cleaned out. Those are the  genetics that got cleaned out and all the good genetics that were able to stay that  were fertile and people didn't want to get rid of, they stayed. So, you know, hopefully  
**[1:42:27-1:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:42:27):**  that's the silver lining I can see at least in these kinds of situations for the cattle  market as a whole. That makes sense.  I see it. You know, we're talking about kind of a cow sell off, which I think, I think  
**[1:42:45-1:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:42:45):**  there is a cow sell off kind of going on. So we've got, we've got our eight and 10 year  old cows coming off the last good cycle. Like a lot of those cows that people paid way too  much money for in 2014 off the last high cycle are starting to come out of production. You  
**[1:43:03-1:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:43:03):**  know, that's, that's the B herd and the C herds that are, that are going to town that  might already be in town. And I'll just be blunt. In order to get through the next few  years of agriculture, there's a lot of high input cows that are going to die. Whether  
**[1:43:22-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:43:22):**  they die in a pasture because producer can't afford all the inputs or they die at the barn  or they, they die at the plant. It's going to be a lot of high input, high energy needing  cattle that aren't going to make it another five years.  
**[1:43:36-1:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:43:36):**  And there's a gentleman down here in Texas. I think you kind of do that. We've, we've  talked about it before, but they buy, they buy really cheap cows at the sale barn, try  and feed them up, get them fat and then resell them to other people. I don't know if you  
**[1:43:51-1:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:43:51):**  remember.  I, you know, I think I know who you're talking about. The guy that, the guy that's really  into his antibiotic use. Yeah. Yeah. So to me that, that, how does that not cause a problem  
**[1:44:05-1:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:44:05):**  for customers? Cause if you don't know why that cow is in, you know, he'll buy open cows  and get them pregnant and feed them.  They're all at the barn for a really good reason.  
**[1:44:14-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:44:14):**  Exactly. And so now you want to continue those genetics. As I was sitting there thinking,  well, I took some cows to the sale barn that needed to get slaughtered. What if a guy like  this went and bought them, did the same thing that he was doing, feed them up and try and  
**[1:44:27-1:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:44:27):**  sell them. And now somebody's over there.  I get the business model. So you take one of your cows to the barn and they sell her  for a hundred bucks to a guy like that. He thinks he got a great deal. Not knowing why  
**[1:44:40-1:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:44:40):**  you took her to the barn, he's going to take her home right off the truck, put a needle  of Drax in her LA 200 in her to make sure that you don't, she stays healthy and didn't  get the rest of his cows sick that are standing in a dirt lot, getting fed hay and a ration.  
**[1:44:55-1:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:44:55):**  Okay. You can feed condition and fertility on anything.  Yep, exactly.  And then he can turn around and feed those things for 30 days, make them look good. And  
**[1:45:06-1:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:45:06):**  as long as they've been standing in the pen of the bull, he can turn around and sell them  as exposed and make a couple hundred dollars ahead on them, hold them for 30 days.  Is that a viable business model? 100%. Is he doing anybody in the industry any favors?  
**[1:45:20-1:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:45:20):**  Fuck no.  And that's exactly it. He's just getting the rejects and sugarcoating them with fat and  Sell them to some other sucker.  
**[1:45:36-1:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:45:36):**  Yep. Exactly.  I don't think guys like you and me are buying cows from that guy.  No, but somebody is, you know, somebody is like, well, I want to try and get into cows  
**[1:45:46-1:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:45:46):**  and stuff. It's like, oh, well, here's this guy. He seems like he knows a lot and stuff  and he's got these good cows are not quite as much as I was wanting to, you know, thinking  about spending. So perfect. That'll work for me. Well, then he's going to go and he's going  
**[1:45:57-1:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:45:57):**  to get my cow that had horrible feet, didn't get pregnant, couldn't keep weight. And then  now the problem is just his. Well, that's no, you know, we can't hate that business  model.  
**[1:46:13-1:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:46:13):**  But it's viable. And, you know, I don't know what we can, what we as fellow producers can  do to discourage that practice or if there's education that we can try to give people as  to maybe why that's not so great. But at the end of the day, Kevin, there's 340 million  
**[1:46:39-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:46:39):**  people in this country. Something like 1.6% of us are engaged in agriculture. So what  is that? 2 million. Yeah. Okay. That's the farmers. That's migrant laborers. That's landowners.  That's tenant farmers. That's ranchers. That's custom grazers. That's feedlot operators,  
**[1:47:00-1:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:47:00):**  backgrounders. That's everybody. So when you really drill down to it, how many people are  in the cattle business? A million? Even less than the 600,000. Okay. So let's just say  there's less than a million of us that own cattle. Yeah. Then we start getting down to  
**[1:47:19-1:47:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:47:19):**  like really breaking down how many guys are in seed stock? How many guys are in commercial  cow calf? Like, I don't even want to really count backgrounders and feedlots. Because  once that calf is a year old, if it goes to the commodity system, to me, that's completely  
**[1:47:39-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:47:39):**  separate.  Oh, like it's not at that point, you're not a part of it anymore.  Right. Once you take that animal out of the pasture, and it gets confined for the rest  
**[1:47:51-1:48:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:47:51):**  of its life, like, from my pasture, like, for example, my pasture to the barn, to a  backgrounder, to a feedlot, to the packing plant, like, when it sees its last day in  pasture, that's when I that's when it's not even not even on my radar anymore.  
**[1:48:07-1:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:48:07):**  Like you don't, you don't, we shouldn't, it's like, we shouldn't consider them on the same  rank as everybody else in ag. Like you can, you can ride that horse out there and check  all those cows and feed them and keep doing that and farm the corn and everything. But  
**[1:48:21-1:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:48:21):**  you're, you're, you're not  You ain't ranching.  That ain't ranching. No.  
**[1:48:27-1:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:48:27):**  Like, if you're riding through dusty ass pins all day, and you don't see a blade of grass,  that ain't ranching. To me anyway, like, write in if I'm wrong and explain to me how I'm  wrong.  
**[1:48:39-1:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:48:39):**  Exactly. You know, it's I hate that that we have such a system that's built like that.  But at least that gives opportunity for, for the rest who don't want to live in that kind  of system to at least grow and have their say. More now, now that it because it's not  
**[1:49:01-1:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:49:01):**  just I think the biggest problem is that people in the ag industry don't want to live by a  notion that customers always right. You know, the customer isn't always right. But when  a lot of the customers are telling you, Hey, like, we don't, we don't know exactly what  
**[1:49:17-1:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:49:17):**  y'all are putting in our food. We don't really like the way that you're handling our the  food.  And the American meat is there. He says, Oh, that's fine. The science says it's safe withdrawal  
**[1:49:27-1:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:49:27):**  periods.  It's like, Hey, we withdraw periods. It's like, okay, that's withdrawal to a certain  level. And you don't know exactly what else. Because I saw something yesterday about, you  
**[1:49:43-1:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:49:43):**  know how that because I still don't know exactly how they test on I want to look into it more.  But testing the carcasses for antibiotics, you know, testing every single carcass. With  as many thousands of carcasses that are being tested every single day every single week,  
**[1:50:01-1:50:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:50:01):**  it's like 650,000 a week.  You know, are you telling me every single 651 of those 650,000 got got, you know, tested  every single one, every single one got inspected perfectly? Or even on top of that, whatever  
**[1:50:19-1:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:50:19):**  cattle that we're importing from other countries, guarantee it's worse.  Oh, God, we haven't even talked about Brazilian imports yet.  You know, well, Brazilian, Mexican, Canadian. Yeah. All of them.  
**[1:50:33-1:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:50:33):**  So a couple years ago, I was at we're at shit. Executive link meeting for Rashing for Profit.  And let's see, I gotta leave out some names here. So don't get sued. There was a gentleman  that was in his 60s that had been a feedlot vet for a long time for a major feedlot system.  
**[1:51:01-1:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:51:01):**  And you know, when he sets in front of a room of 200 of us and says, yeah, pretty much everything  is either classified as high risk or low risk. The high risk cattle get Jackson and the low  risk cattle get la 200 off the truck.  
**[1:51:17-1:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:51:17):**  When they go into when they show up at the yard. High risk cattle get Jackson right off  the truck and low risk cattle got la through la 200. So I held up my hand. And I said,  sir, are you saying every animal that gets off the truck pretty much gets antibiotic?  
**[1:51:31-1:51:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:51:31):**  He says, No. I'm saying we classify things based on risk. Low risk animals get this and  high risk animals get that. I said, Is there such a thing as no risk animal? And he moved  on to the next question.  
**[1:51:45-1:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:51:45):**  And you know, it's very, very similar from what we hear, you know, on social media. You  know, every once in a while, one of those guys that works at a feedlot or a big process  or you know, big feedlot or big background will slip up and say, Yeah, we do we do this  
**[1:51:58-1:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:51:58):**  with antibiotics. And this is why. Okay. So now you're trying to justify it.  So you do do it. You're just trying to like keep it on the download, like, Oh, look, it's  not as bad as it sounds.  
**[1:52:12-1:52:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:52:12):**  Well, they say like, Oh, we don't we don't just mass feed antibiotics indiscriminately.  What do you call putting it in the feed? Like, what do you call an animal that walks off  the truck and you have 10 seconds to look at it, you're sticking a needle in its neck?  
**[1:52:25-1:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:52:25):**  Yeah. Oh, we have to do that because because efficiency because it's more profit, it's  more efficient that way. You try riding through 25,000 head of cattle a day and spend 30 minutes  a pen to pull calves. We don't have that kind of time. Well, that indicates that that is  
**[1:52:42-1:52:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:52:42):**  a fundamental flaw in your production. So yeah, there's a problem there. You know, the  fundamental flaw is we're putting cattle in an unnatural environment with a lot of it  an extremely pathogenic friendly environment. Like, yeah, we build these feedlots to be  
**[1:52:58-1:53:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:52:58):**  perfect environments for pathogens to live and breed.  Yeah. And then you have to give the Yeah, that's why you have to give antibiotics, you  have to give you have to deworm them have to do everything vaccines, everything in order  
**[1:53:11-1:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:53:11):**  to just prevent the the, like you said, the environment that they created,  like, lung cysts, and lung problems, and feedlot cattle. Hey, if they weren't standing in the  middle of 75,000 other cattle and 15 acres in a dusty lot for three months, their lungs  
**[1:53:32-1:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:53:32):**  probably wouldn't be fucked up.  Yeah. And or, you know, having three 4000 hedges dropping dead in a in a couple days.  Because because how fat they are how, you know, because they can't, they don't have  
**[1:53:45-1:54:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:53:45):**  shade, they don't even have a way to escape the heat.  You know, I almost forgot about that. Yeah, I kind of had forgotten about that. And yeah,  everybody. You know, at the time when that happened, I really tried to stay quiet, because  
**[1:54:02-1:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:54:02):**  whatever the number is, whether it was 1000 or 10,000. It's horrible. It's, it's, it's  horrible that those animals had to go through that. And what makes it even worse, is people  put them there. People put them in that condition. People put them in that unhealthy condition,  
**[1:54:23-1:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:54:23):**  and that unhealthy situation, where a little bit of heat overnight was too much for him.  Now, I'll also say this, I've heard that maybe, maybe one of those places that had  a bunch of cattle parish had some water issues for a few hours. Yeah. And I can buy, you  
**[1:54:44-1:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:54:44):**  know, when cattle don't have enough water, when it's that hot, like they almost go  into a scarcity mindset and almost panic. Like, and when water does come back, instead  of drinking the 20 gallons they normally would, they're gonna drink 30. Yeah, you know,  
**[1:54:58-1:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:54:58):**  because they're, they're worried that it might not be there again, when they come  back. I get it, it makes sense. Whether there was or wasn't a water problem. Like, people  still put them in that situation. People,  
**[1:55:12-1:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:55:12):**  Sorry. And before I, I defended it, you know, saying like, look, it's, that's a normal,  that's a, that's a thing with weather, it happens. And what are you going to expect  whenever you have super fat cattle, and you have weather changes like that, and they're  
**[1:55:27-1:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:55:27):**  overfed, there's no shade kind of deal. And I was talking to another guy, and he was saying,  you know, there's, there's also possibility somebody screwed up in their rations, could  have messed up in their food and done something like that. And that's entirely possible  
**[1:55:43-1:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:55:43):**  that there could have been a truck that got mixed with too hot of a ration for the temperature.  And they haul and they mistakenly fed it to a couple pins. That could have happened. Good  luck at getting anybody to ever admit that. And it also reminded me of back during during  
**[1:55:59-1:56:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:55:59):**  COVID when, you know, we were having so many issues with like pork and poultry. I don't  know if you remember there was a pretty sure was pork. There was a plant I think up in  Iowa that they did the  
**[1:56:13-1:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:56:13):**  Oh, they had to euthanize several entire barns of hogs up and they did it through like asphyxiation  through heat, through the humidity.  I remember right.  
**[1:56:27-1:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:56:27):**  I thought they pumped in like co2 into the barn.  It was some it was something like that to where they pretty much suffocated.  Not a great way to go.  
**[1:56:36-1:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:56:36):**  And but to think like, man, that's I don't I don't like that. I I'm in I'm in the  ag industry. I'm a part of this and I how can anybody sit there and just sweep that  under the rug like that's that's bad. And I you know, there's no reason we should  
**[1:56:53-1:57:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:56:53):**  be having some kind of system that allows I, I don't, I don't blame people for becoming  vegan for going and seeing something like that because that's that's  for production. That's awful.  
**[1:57:07-1:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:57:07):**  Our friendship McGregor hit the nail 100% on the head when he said that that feedlots,  American barns and hog houses are why the vegans are going to win.  Yeah, it's because of that. And that puts all their focus on those things. And they  
**[1:57:24-1:57:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:57:24):**  think, well, because this is what we see, that must mean it's everything. And well,  it's not.  Yeah. And they love guys like us in with that,  
**[1:57:34-1:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:57:34):**  like help us try to get away from that. You can be on our side, you don't have to eat  me, you don't have to use animal products, but at least support the ones that are trying  to do a good job. Taking care of their animals, taking care of the land, and trying to ensure  
**[1:57:50-1:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:57:50):**  that when we do slaughter them in and utilize them, that it's done humanely, it's done efficiently,  and it's done in.  But they don't have a lot of time.  
**[1:58:05-1:58:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:58:05):**  No matter where you are in agriculture with livestock. And I think we would all agree  on a couple things. Okay, we need to support other people in our industry. Yeah. Okay.  That's great. I can't support somebody that's using indefensible practices. Like if you  
**[1:58:24-1:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:58:24):**  can't defend your practices against public scrutiny, I'm not going to help defend you.  And COVID shined a light on a lot of dark corners. Social media. You know when smartphones  came out and there was a camera and they put the first camera on a phone. And it could  
**[1:58:49-1:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:58:49):**  do video. Like almost immediately I had the thought like, holy shit, there's going to  be so much awesome stuff on YouTube now. Like there's going to be plane crashes, there's  going to be car wrecks, there's going to be all this stuff because everybody's got a camera  
**[1:59:03-1:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:59:03):**  with them all the time. And it didn't happen. And it didn't happen. And it didn't happen.  And then like, now here we are 15-20 years later. Now that's the reality. Yeah. That  there is a lot more transparency that there is a lot more flow of information. And colleges,  
**[1:59:25-1:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:59:25):**  universities are no longer the universal seats of learning that they once were. I mean, we  have these supercomputers we carry around in our pocket. You're probably listening to  this podcast on one of them right now. It is literally a supercomputer that's more powerful  
**[1:59:42-2:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=1:59:42):**  than everything, every computer on earth 40 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like, it's so  wild to me that we get to watch the collapse of civilization on a worldwide scale. In 4k.  In 4k streaming. And I can watch that in the bathtub. I can watch it when I'm out in the  
**[2:00:03-2:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:00:03):**  cow pasture. I don't have to sit on the couch in front of a TV. The interconnectivity that  social media and smartphones and internet has brought us. It's brought so many of us  closer together. It's created so many different new communities. But at the same time, it's  
**[2:00:21-2:00:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:00:21):**  also allowing us to shine a light in those dark corners of our industries that we don't  want anybody to see. Not that we don't want anybody to see, but the people that made those  dark corners don't want you to see. And force the uncomfortable conversations a lot. I think  
**[2:00:38-2:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:00:38):**  that's a really important part of it too. The ag industry is going to have to, I think  it's going to be making a lot of big changes, especially in the next 10 years. I think something's  it's either going to look really ugly for a lot or really good for some. It's tough to  
**[2:00:58-2:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:00:58):**  even say really. It's not going to be like the last 20, 30 years.  It's going to be different. It's definitely going to be different. And my crystal ball  got really cloudy about mid-March of 2020. And it hasn't really cleared up.  
**[2:01:18-2:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:01:18):**  Once that happened, I got really lucky right when it hit in April. I had a meet and greet  open house bull sale. I had all my bulls there available to sell. And I was like, man, I'm  not going to be able to sell any of these bulls. And luckily, I sold all but two that  
**[2:01:39-2:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:01:39):**  day. That was perfect. I had enough people come in. I was like, if that didn't happen,  I'd be screwed for the rest of the year. And hopefully ever since then, it's gotten better.  But the thing I keep thinking is the price of diesel feed, fertilizer, pesticides, all  
**[2:01:57-2:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:01:57):**  that stuff is not going to just become cheap again. And it's not just going to have a,  Oh, okay, you can use whatever you want. We really got to start hunkering down on how  to take care of ourselves without everyone else, at least, you know, inputs and see how  
**[2:02:19-2:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:02:19):**  far we make it pretty much.  And I hope we can make it to the end, or at least some of us, enough of us that we can  you know, keep some people fed.  
**[2:02:28-2:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:02:28):**  Yeah, exactly. That's, that's the goal. You know, hopefully, if the cattle don't, if I  don't last in the cattle business with my cattle, I'll at least be able to do something  in it. I'll be able to continue something going forward. So  
**[2:02:41-2:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:02:41):**  Okay, I know we've been we've been at it for just a little over two hours. You You good?  You need a break? You want to keep going?  I'm, I'm fine. Whatever.  
**[2:02:51-2:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:02:51):**  So this morning, Lincoln was texting me. I think he just listened to our last episode  together. He was asking about SAV genetics or SAV bloodlines.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:05-2:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:03:05):**  If you had any plans to add in any. Where to go? I see Kevin likes those SAV bulls.  And I've had a hard time with SAV having bulls with 1000 pound, 205 day weights is not real  world sustainable.  
**[2:03:24-2:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:03:24):**  That is I mean, I understand that. The thing is, though, is that when I use those genetics  in my herd, I get I mean, I get the heavier weaning weights, I get the better maternal  quality. And that's just me. I don't care if anybody else doesn't use them. That's just  
**[2:03:38-2:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:03:38):**  what I use. That's how my mentors in Brazil and here. That's the kind of cattle they use  this kind of cattle I like. And I'm just trying to make my own herd utilizing some of those  genetics. It's not all of them. But I don't even pay attention to those weaning weights  
**[2:03:56-2:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:03:56):**  and stuff.  If you have the money to be able to feed them out that heavy, do what you want. But luckily,  the genetics that I've used, they benefit me. So that's I don't get 1000 pound weaning  
**[2:04:15-2:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:04:15):**  weights, I'm probably never going to. But they always end up being the heaviest weaned  of the group, compared to other bulls that are like, well, look at my top 1% EPD for  weaning weight. Well, usually I don't get that actual performance out of that animal  
**[2:04:34-2:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:04:34):**  compared to the other ones. Because even because even then, here's another thing, though, when  you look at those 1000 pound weaning weights, another thing to remember is how they ratio  in their contemporary groups. So if you have a contemporary group of let's say, 50 bulls,  
**[2:04:52-2:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:04:52):**  these they're all born in the same time span. And all 50 of those bulls were in the same  program and they were fed the exact same. And you take the average weaning weight of  all 50 of those bulls, and let's say it's 900 pounds, well, you'll set that 900 pounds  
**[2:05:07-2:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:05:07):**  to 100 as, as the median as the average, we'll just say 100. So any animal that weans heavier  than 900 is going to end up having a ratio number higher than a higher than 100. And  anything less than 900 pounds would be less than 100. So let's say I have a bull that  
**[2:05:32-2:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:05:32):**  weaned 1000 pounds in that contemporary group, well, he's going to ratio over 100. He might  ratio 120, let's say the association will say he ratioed 120 in that contemporary group.  Well, that's, that's telling me that that bull performed better in the same group than  
**[2:05:53-2:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:05:53):**  another bull, even though it was a 900 pound weaning weight, 900 pound weaning weight anywhere  else, it'd be like, that's amazing. But in that program, it didn't perform quite as well  as the other bulls.  
**[2:06:02-2:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:06:02):**  900 pound weaning weight would kill my cows.  Exactly. But you know, if you took that same contemporary group, let's say those same 50  bulls and put them in your program, well, that bull that weaned 1000 pounds, and he  
**[2:06:19-2:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:06:19):**  had that high ratio in your program, he might also have that high ratio, but right, terrible  to the kinds of weaning weights you would take out,  Like, so down the road on like on a gardener cow, he would wean, you know, a 900 pound  
**[2:06:33-2:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:06:33):**  calf, but you bring that bull and you put them on my little cows, and he's going to  wean something like something like a 650 700, where, you know, another bull would be weaning  like a five, five to 650.  
**[2:06:45-2:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:06:45):**  And you know, there's so many genetics out there that can produce just as heavy weaning  weights. And so is that the end of the day, for the last 20, 30 years weaning weights,  they say weaning weights have increased, which I mean, they have, but at the same time, if  
**[2:07:01-2:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:07:01):**  you look at the bulls from back then compared to now, they're, they're all still in the  600 to 700 pound range. Nothing's really changed in the grand scheme of it all. I think they've  been able to reach that quicker, but at the same time, weaning, the weaning age is still  
**[2:07:19-2:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:07:19):**  the same. It's not like that's changed, right? Still going to be, you know, 205 day weight  or however they want it. And so that doesn't really bother me too much. I'm not really  trying to worry about the weaning weights too much, because for me and my operators,  
**[2:07:36-2:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:07:36):**  that means I'm pushing too hard. If I get way too big a weaning weights, there are some  animals that just excel beyond the others, and they're going to be way heavier than some  of the rest. And those are the ones I'm going to try and utilize the genetics on as long  
**[2:07:49-2:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:07:49):**  as I didn't have to feed them so hard to get to them. I creep feed a little bit, you know,  I just give them maybe half a bucket or so depending on how many are in the pen, but  I just give them enough that they can go in there, eat several bites, just to also help  
**[2:08:07-2:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:08:07):**  out the cow with my small operation. That's what we've been doing, but we'll see how that  goes.  Okay, kind of last question, then I'll let you go and get on with the rest of your day.  
**[2:08:17-2:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:08:17):**  No problem. It's not really a question. It's kind of a statement. So Lincoln also was talking  about going back to some of the old Angus bloodlines and seeing good results with them  as far as grass efficiency, bloodlines like emulation, RITO, Nutrend, and Traveler, which  
**[2:08:35-2:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:08:35):**  I mean, those all could have been Greek, I wouldn't know anything. Any of those names  mean anything to you?  Yeah, so well, the RITO genetics that when I use a Shoff genetics, I really like Resource  
**[2:08:46-2:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:08:46):**  and Renown who are full brothers. And they're out of a bowl called RITO 3407, 7075.  I've heard you talk about resource before.  Yeah. And so that's those genetics. And combined with Traveler genetics on the bottom. So for  
**[2:09:03-2:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:09:03):**  me, those genetics do really good. I love those.  Traveler genetics on the bottom, you mean on the maternal side?  Yes. So like the maternal grandsire, which would be the dad of the mom. He's an SAV bull,  
**[2:09:17-2:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:09:17):**  but he's Traveler lineage.  Okay.  So like, I don't, I'm really bad on the Angus genetics compared to the Brahmas, but you  
**[2:09:28-2:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:09:28):**  have one bull Traveler. Well, then he has a son that's like Traveler II and then Traveler  to a lineage of bulls that are named Traveler. And same way with the cows, it's lineage of  cows with the same name as a family.  
**[2:09:40-2:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:09:40):**  Yeah. Coming up with names for my cows is always challenging.  I think he's right though. The EXT and all those bloodlines, you can't really go wrong  back in the time when that's where they were focused was, you know, maternal quality and  
**[2:09:55-2:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:09:55):**  maternal production, especially.  I don't think I've asked you about Fagrel Cattle Company. What do you think of their  bulls?  
**[2:10:04-2:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:10:04):**  I don't, I've looked at some of the catalogs and I just don't need this, but I've heard  he's a master marketer. I've heard there's people that have done really good with their  cattle. I don't know anything about it, but it's not, it's not what I use.  
**[2:10:21-2:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:10:21):**  I'll just say the same thing I always say when somebody asks me about Kit Fagrel. I  believe he could sell freezers in Fairbanks, Alaska in February. Okay. And ice makers in  Fairbanks in February. Okay. I also think that he's got some bulls that live up to what  
**[2:10:40-2:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:10:40):**  he says they'll do.  Really? I, cause I don't see them much. I don't see much advertising, that kind of stuff.  So that's why I always kind of stays under the radar for me.  
**[2:10:51-2:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:10:51):**  Okay.  But, well, I think, I think that's about all I got today, buddy.  Appreciate it.  
**[2:11:01-2:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/87-Kevin-Deleu--Part-deux-e1pkg7s#t=2:11:01):**  Been long enough.  It's been good. Really enjoyed it. Both episodes, you know, love doing this.  All right. Well, that's it. Go ahead and go have a great week. Get out there and make

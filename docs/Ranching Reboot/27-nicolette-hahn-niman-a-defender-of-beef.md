Coming from Marin County, California we have a special treat today.  We have a vegetarian that raises cattle, an environmental lawyer and a best-selling author,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:03):**  Nicolette Hahn-Nyman.  And I want to apologize in advance, Nicolette's audio dropped out a couple times.  Here we go.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:11):**  So, Nicolette, thanks for joining us today.  Appreciate you being here.  Sorry about the scheduling difficulties.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:19):**  It's alright.  I have listened to your last book, Defending Beef, and you've updated it a little bit,  yes?  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:29):**  Yes, quite a bit.  Okay.  I want to talk about some of those changes and some of the new knowledge that you've  
**[0:01:36-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:36):**  thrown in there because I haven't had a chance to read the new version yet.  So for our listeners that probably aren't familiar with your story, tell us a little  bit about yourself.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:45):**  Where are you at and how you got to be where you are?  Okay, sure.  Well, I live on a ranch in Northern California.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:01:54):**  We're in Marin County, so it's a little bit north of San Francisco and right on the Pacific  Ocean.  We live in that kind of climate where it's...  
**[0:02:03-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:02:03):**  I mean, I've been told there are five of them in the world where it's a Mediterranean climate  where it's just basically dry during the summer and fall, and then it rains during the winter,  and then it stops raining in about April, and then there's absolutely no precipitation  
**[0:02:19-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:02:19):**  until late fall again.  So it's a kind of a unique climate in that regard.  And we have a ranch that's totally grass-based.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:02:30):**  We have cattle that are grass grown and finished here that we raise.  And then we also normally, right at the moment, we don't have them on the ranch, but normally  we have heritage turkeys that are also outdoor raised.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:02:44):**  And we have had a few other types of animals in the recent past, including goats, but we  don't have those right now either.  So we're always trying to have more diversity in terms of what we're doing.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:02:57):**  But when we did the goats, we found that we were just overwhelmed because my husband always  does all of the...  He takes charge of everything.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:03:07):**  So slaughtering, marketing, delivery.  We don't sell live animals.  We sell the meat directly to the end user.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:03:17):**  So it was when we started having goats on the ranch, we loved having that species diversity,  but then we realized we had to have a whole new business that we created with finding  the right slaughterhouse, finding the right distribution people, finding the right customers.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:03:34):**  And so anyway, we're really interested in as much diversity as possible, but right now  we're just doing the cattle and the turkeys.  Great.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:03:47):**  And a little more about my background too.  So I'm originally from the Midwest.  I'm from Michigan and I was one of those kids that grew up out in nature.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:03:56):**  Spent a lot of time outdoors, majored in biology in college.  I was always interested in the natural world and environmental issues and just wanted to  be part of being a good environmentalist my whole life.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:04:11):**  And when I was in college, majoring in biology, I decided to stop eating meat.  So I became a vegetarian at that time.  And years later I went to law school, became a lawyer, and then I ended up becoming an  
**[0:04:22-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:04:22):**  environmental lawyer after practicing for a while as a prosecuting attorney and then  as working in a law firm.  And started working on environmental causes for National Wildlife Federation and then  
**[0:04:35-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:04:35):**  was hired by Bobby Kennedy Jr. to be the senior attorney for the group Waterkeeper Alliance,  which is based in New York and it's totally focused on water pollution issues.  So I did that for two years and during that whole time I was focused on the question of  
**[0:04:53-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:04:53):**  pollution from the meat industry.  So I really sort of became a specialist in that issue.  And during that work, I met a lot of really good farmers and ranchers that were doing  
**[0:05:04-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:05:04):**  a really good job of stewarding their animals and their land.  And that's how I met Bill Nyman, who's the founder of the Nyman Ranch Meat Organization.  And I ended up marrying him and moving to California.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:05:15):**  So I got into ranching the very old fashioned way of through marriage.  And initially didn't think I would probably be directly involved in the ranch because  I was planning on continuing my career as an environmental lawyer.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:05:28):**  But I moved to our ranch and got super interested in what we were doing.  And just did a little bit more work here and there on the ranch and then more and more  and pretty soon I was doing it full time.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:05:40):**  So I did it full time for about seven years.  And then we had two boys and a lot of my time got diverted towards them.  And I started writing books and I've written the book I just have coming out now, Defending  
**[0:05:53-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:05:53):**  Beef is the third book I've written.  So I wrote a book called Righteous Pork Chop, which was all about kind of describing the  industrialization of the meat industry and how that happened and what the implications  
**[0:06:03-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:03):**  for that are.  And then I wrote the book Defending Beef six years ago.  And then I was asked by the publisher to update it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:12):**  And I was happy to do that because I was really convinced that the issues I wrote about are  more timely than ever.  But when I started, I thought I could do it in a couple of months.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:21):**  And then I started writing it, rewriting it and I started going page by page and I realized,  wow, there's a lot I want to redo.  So I ended up taking about a year to rewrite it and it just came out a few days ago.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:32):**  So brand new version of Defending Beef.  And we've changed the subtitle, which I like.  I really like the subtitle now.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:38):**  It's the Ecological and Nutritional Case for Meat.  And that's really what the book is.  So that's kind of my background.  
**[0:06:45-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:06:45):**  I spend most of my time nowadays just taking care of our household and raising our sons.  But I'm also still really involved in advocacy around ranching.  And then I help out on a ranch and, you know, whenever I have an opportunity to talk to  
**[0:07:01-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:07:01):**  people and, you know, I get invited to speak at classrooms and other groups.  And I like sharing this message about the importance of animals in the food system,  but also the importance of doing it well.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:07:16):**  I couldn't agree more, Al.  The fun part is figuring out where to stick that lever in and start the conversation.  Like I said, I have listened to the previous version of Defending Beef on audiobook and  
**[0:07:32-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:07:32):**  got a trip coming up here in a few days.  So I'm going to make sure I've got the new version downloaded.  The environmental implications of meat, you know, even over the last, you said you've  
**[0:07:44-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:07:44):**  been working on it for the last year and it seems like over the last year, every week  something new was coming out.  There was a new article in Mass Media or a new study that we'd find out about, about,  
**[0:07:56-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:07:56):**  you know, a link between microbiome and this or a link between soil biology and this or  link between, you know, soil health and animal health and human health.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:08:07):**  Yeah, well, I thought that that last question that you just mentioned is something I thought  the book The Hidden Half of Nature by David Montgomery and his wife Ann Bilkey wrote so  beautifully about in that in their book.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:08:23):**  And that's one of the many books that I've read since the original version of the book  came out.  And all of that has influenced the way that I've rewritten the book.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:08:33):**  But I would agree.  I think the topic is really timely right now.  And so I in revising the book, I included a lot of new research about carbon sequestration  
**[0:08:44-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:08:44):**  and soil biology.  And I added a great deal more on the climate change topic because I address it pretty thoroughly.  In the first version of the book.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:08:54):**  But I found that that seems to be the thing that people that are not eating meat or are  reducing their meat are really focused on.  They're really convinced that, you know, eating meat is bad for climate change.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:07):**  So I just wanted to really directly address that issue.  Like they've got it totally backwards, don't they?  Oh, yeah, because I mean, this is I love this phrase.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:18):**  I just say this over and over again.  It's not the cow.  It's the how.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:21):**  So, yes, you can do things badly.  But I think that's the thing that I really like about this book is that it's not just  a book that's about the environment.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:27):**  It's about the environment.  It's about how you can go anywhere in agriculture and cause a lot of environmental problems.  That's what my whole work has been all about.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:35):**  That's what my writing is about.  That's what my work as an environmental lawyer was about.  But on the flip side of that, if you raise animals, well, if they're well cared for and  
**[0:09:45-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:45):**  the land is well cared for, you're not just going to be not harming the environment.  You're going to be harming the environment and the health and health of the ecosystem  you're in.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:09:55):**  The thing that I didn't really understand that well until I started researching the  original book is that probably the most important thing you're going to be doing is helping  the soil biology.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:10:09):**  I had been aware that you could have better water-holding capacity in the soil where you  have more active soil biology.  level how this all works. And they're actually, you know,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:10:24):**  there's this whole, you know,  subterranean ecosystem that's down there underground and  wherever you have the presence of animals and especially  
**[0:10:33-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:10:33):**  well managed grazing animals,  you have a kind of a charging of that,  a supercharging of that below ground, you know,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:10:43):**  microscopic biology that's happening and the,  every plant that's in that system is going to benefit from  the presence of those animals because their,  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:10:56):**  their grazing is going to prune the vegetation,  which not only stimulates growth of that plant,  but it also allows other more diverse, you know,  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:04):**  it allows more diversity because other plants have more  opportunity to sprout when that original plant that the  animal was grazing on gets grazed.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:12):**  And then you have a whole process that gets triggered in  terms of what's happening when the plant takes basically the  carbon through photosynthesis takes carbon from the process  
**[0:11:25-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:25):**  of photosynthesis from the atmosphere and powered by the  sun and then puts carbon and other substances into the soil.  And the roots are an incredibly important part of that story.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:39):**  And they are making exchanges with the soil and the plant is  getting what it needs for its growth.  And the plant is also giving an exchange.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:49):**  It's giving carbon to the soil and then the carbon can stay  in the soil and just basically powers the whole life of the  whole system.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:11:57):**  And all of these exchanges are happening on the microscopic  level.  And it's now been shown that this is all of this is  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:12:05):**  necessary for a healthy soil,  which has then the foundation for diverse vegetation and  above ground life.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:12:13):**  Everything from insects to elephants benefit from having that  active and really diverse soil life.  And the fascinating thing is that people have, for decades,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:12:27):**  kind of assumed that cattle and other grazing animals were  damaging ecosystems,  but more and more evidence from around the world is showing  
**[0:12:35-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:12:35):**  really good anecdotal evidence as well as very carefully  done peer reviewed science is showing by mostly by  rangeland scientists around the world is showing that if you

**[0:12:52-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:12:52):**  the microbiome of the soil will be less diverse and less  active.  And then you'll have a much less diverse vegetation and  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:00):**  you'll have less vegetation.  So what animal-  Which leads to less wildlife and less game.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:06):**  Alive ecosystem from the ground up.  And that leads to less wildlife and less game.  And then it's kind of like a descending spiral.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:16):**  Once we take cows off the land that are ruminant,  ruminants off the land,  it's just a descending spiral of biology back to back to,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:25):**  well, it's from soil to dirt.  Yes, exactly.  Because the distinction between dirt and soil is a really  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:33):**  important one.  Dirt is basically lifeless and it's kind of broken down  pieces of rock, whereas soil is full of life.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:42):**  And it's not just the microorganisms I've been talking about,  but all kinds of other things,  earthworms and beetles and all kinds of other insects.  
**[0:13:49-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:13:49):**  And I really appreciate the work of Dr. Jonathan Lundgren,  who's an entomologist and former scientist at USDA.  And he talks a lot about the loss of so many insect species  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:02):**  and just the presence of insects.  We've had this massive kind of die off the world over  because he says, really,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:08):**  we need these insects for healthy ecosystems.  And he's really focused on good farming systems,  really benefiting from the presence of this diverse insect  
**[0:14:20-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:20):**  life and how, again, when you have good grazing systems,  those actually foster lots of diversity and lots of  different kinds of insects and they balance each other out.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:31):**  So he always says, when there's one insect,  that's considered a pest that over abundance means your,  the system is out of balance.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:38):**  And just treating that symptom of your out of balance  system with a poison is a never ending battle.  And so what I'm interested in,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:49):**  my whole focus has become,  and I would say between the first book that I wrote,  Defending Beef and Now, it's even more so for me,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:14:56):**  it's been amplified by so much I've learned and read,  is for me, the focus is how do we create farming  and ranching systems that are based on this idea  
**[0:15:06-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:06):**  that we foster that biological health,  that we learn to understand nature and how do we foster this?  And then when we do that,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:15):**  we address so many of the problems that we worry about  in agriculture, we address drought, we address,  I mean, not that we can completely solve it,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:23):**  but for what we can do on our land and help the systems  that we're working with and their sustainability,  when you address things on this biological level,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:34):**  you're gonna make more water retained in your soil,  you're gonna make a more diverse soil biology,  you're gonna make fewer,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:41):**  you're gonna reduce the problems that you have  with any kind of over abundance of any plant or any insect,  you're gonna have a balanced system.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:49):**  And then when you have that kind of a system,  you create a healthier food,  you create a healthier animal if you're raising animals,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:15:56):**  and then their food, whether it's milk or meat,  is gonna be healthier too.  So it's just like the whole system is much healthier.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:04):**  And then the people living and working there  are healthier too.  So it's a whole different way of doing farming and ranching  
**[0:16:12-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:12):**  than I think the dominant model has been for a long time.  At the heart of it, we're talking about like the difference  between a regenerative grass fed system  
**[0:16:25-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:25):**  and the current commodity crop and CAFO system  of protein production.  And just so we're clear,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:35):**  the chicken and the pork and the turkey industries,  they have the same problem that we do about,  you know, how do,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:46):**  and we all really have the same mission.  Okay, and the mission is to produce  high quality, good protein.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:16:53):**  So what are some of the differences you've uncovered  about an animal that, you know,  eats more of a commodity diet, you know,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:03):**  whether it's a commodity hay that's grown with pesticides  and synthetic fertilizers  versus an all natural grass type animal?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:11):**  Well, I have to say, first of all,  I think the core for any healthy agricultural system  with animals is to focus on  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:19):**  what does that animal's biology require?  What does their physiology require?  And just fundamental to that, you know,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:25):**  I just always think about, you know,  the analogy with children and how you rate,  especially now that I have kids, you know,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:30):**  how you raise them.  Well, the first thing my parents said every single day  is get outside, you know,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:35):**  like they wanted us out of the house, you know,  but they just wanted us to be moving our bodies  and be out in the fresh air,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:40):**  be out in the sunshine and move and get movement, you know?  And that I think is absolutely essential  for healthy animals as well.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:47):**  So it's not as much of an issue with ranching.  I mean, pretty much when you're ranching,  that's what the animals are already doing.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:17:53):**  But when you're talking about pigs and poultry,  that is in my mind,  the fundamental problem with most of the modern systems  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:00):**  is that the animals are put in an unhealthy environment.  You know, so the first thing is,  what is this animal designed to do?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:07):**  And when you have poultry and pigs,  those are omnivorous animals, obviously.  They need to have a diverse diet  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:13):**  and they need to be breathing fresh air and foraging  and moving around, you know?  And when you have grazing animals, you know,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:21):**  those are pretty much mostly outside,  except for dairy cattle, which really,  they do need to be outside in my view as much as possible.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:28):**  But grazing animals, I think,  should not just be out and foraging as much as possible.  But also, here's something that I hadn't really thought  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:40):**  that much about.  Again, sort of the reading I've been doing  over the last five years that's influenced the new book.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:46):**  The new book has been quite influenced  by the book, Nourishment, by Dr. Fred Provenza,  who's an expert on animal nutrition.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:18:53):**  And he's, you know, his book, Nourishment,  he's been working for decades on this,  but I hadn't read anything that he'd written  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:00):**  until I read that book.  And I was just blown away by it because, you know,  he shows all this research about how animals  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:08):**  are able to self-select for what their bodies need  on any given day.  And the most fascinating part of that book,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:15):**  and he of course analogizes and take it further  to the human diet, but even just focusing totally  on what he says about the animal diet,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:22):**  he says that essentially all the studies that he's done  about ruminating nutrition and how animals will graze  is that an animal will actually seek out  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:34):**  what it needs on that given day.  And if you test their blood in the morning  and you see that it's lacking, let's say in calcium,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:39):**  you will, and you follow them around,  and they have grad students doing this, you know,  like literally with clipboards,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:44):**  writing down what they're eating,  and they've been able to show that that animal  will seek out plants that are known to contain  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:49):**  high levels of calcium.  And that by the end of the day,  that shortage will generally be remedied,  
**[0:19:55-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:19:55):**  but if the animal has the opportunity to select it.  So he really makes a very powerful case for the need  for a diverse pasture and rangeland.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:05):**  And so again, you know, it's not just about the importance  of, I think having animals outdoors and having them  have fresh air and sunshine and exercise  
**[0:20:13-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:13):**  is absolutely fundamental, but there's also  that whole question of, well, what are they grazing on?  And how much diversity do they have an opportunity  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:22):**  to graze on?  And then of course, you know, I really agree  with Alan Savory and others that are arguing  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:29):**  that how you graze is absolutely critical  as far as, you know, the timing and the movements  of the animals.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:35):**  But just going back to your question, Brian,  I think there's really good scientific evidence  showing that there's a tremendous value  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:45):**  for the animals to have opportunity to have diverse,  that they can access diverse plants every day.  And so that goes back to that whole question  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:20:55):**  of how diverse is your soil?  How diverse are the microorganisms and other organisms  in your soil and how much biology do you have happening  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:04):**  in your soils?  And then that affects everything in terms  of how much diversity you have in your plant life  
**[0:21:10-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:10):**  on your rangelands or pastures.  And then that allows the animals to self-select  what they need nutritionally.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:18):**  And even Dr. Provenza's work even shows  that they will self-medicate if they begin  to have a medical issue, or if they have some kind  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:27):**  of illness, they will seek out things  that will help their, you know, their physical problems.  So there's a lot there, you know,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:34):**  it's a really interesting field.  And this is another area where I think there's more  and more new research coming out  
**[0:21:40-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:40):**  to bolster these kinds of ideas.  Yeah, that makes me think about grazing pressure, like,  do we need to kind of not be so hard  
**[0:21:51-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:21:51):**  on pushing them to not be selective?  Well, I think if you're moving them regularly  and you're, you know, you're timing their movements properly  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:07):**  you're reading your pasture at your rangeland,  whatever it is, and you're paying attention  to what's happening with the grazing.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:17):**  I think for the most part, your system's gonna work,  you know, and I think, you know, the other thing  about all of this is that everything is so site-specific.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:27):**  You know, I think anytime anybody has the answer  it's probably wrong because everything is so specific  to your particular operation.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:38):**  And I know on our place, we're always discussing every,  you know, year and every week what we're doing  and whether we should be doing this or that, you know, so.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:49):**  But I think having a management, you know,  of the grazing is the key, you know,  making sure that you're paying attention  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:22:58):**  to what's happening and that you're trying to read  the impact of what you're doing and then you're responding.  You know, there's that management issue.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:23:06):**  Right.  So this morning we went out and moved cows this morning,  turned them into a new, I think like 66-acre paddock.

Anyway, so we got them moved and we got them all  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:23:29):**  out of the old pasture, rode down to the creek,  just took a little quick check, made sure we had them all,  went up, closed the gate, and then went back out  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:23:36):**  the way we came.  And standing there by the gate that we came in,  there was 12 head and they were just mowing down some clover.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:23:43):**  I mean, they were just going to town on it.  So I thought, okay, I've got my refractometer with me.  So I swiped up a big old handful of it  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:23:52):**  and we got the pliers out and squished it down.  You really gotta work sometimes to get one little drop  of sap out of some of those plants.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:00):**  But we dropped on that refractometer and it was,  and mine only goes to 30, right?  Cause I figured 30 breaks is the highest  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:08):**  I'm ever going to see.  That sucker was off the charts.  Like, yeah, it was above, it was that far above the top  
**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:15):**  of the scale of my refractometer.  Interesting.  Yeah, so then we went back by there,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:24):**  not even 45 minutes later to take a couple salt blocks in  and they were gone off that hilltop and there wasn't,  there wasn't a stem of clover on that hilltop  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:34):**  inside the pasture.  It was still at the ditch.  It was on the other side of the hot wire,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:38):**  but there wasn't one stem of that stuff left in there.  Yeah, they needed it or they wanted it.  You know, and this whole, this,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:49):**  we're kind of going down a little bit of a rabbit hole  here on this, but I was just thinking as you were talking,  part of what I've been kind of running over my head  
**[0:24:58-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:24:58):**  for the last 20 years since I've been living on this ranch  is the importance of the generations teaching each other.  So like, I'm incredibly focused on, you know,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:10):**  with our kids, like from pregnancy, birth, you know,  breastfeeding, feeding, like what they're learning,  how to eat and what, you know,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:18):**  and this whole thing that Fred Provenza talks about,  this nutritional wisdom, which literally starts in the womb.  And I'm increasingly thinking when we're raising animals  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:31):**  that we got to think about giving them opportunities  to really learn from their parents.  I mean, their mothers, especially really,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:38):**  how to forage and how to eat.  And obviously cattle stay, beef cattle,  at least stay with their mothers for a good long time,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:48):**  for the most part.  But I'm thinking, I think this is important  for all the species that we're raising, you know,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:25:54):**  even poultry.  And this is so radical, you know,  this kind of what I'm saying right now  
**[0:26:01-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:01):**  is so radically different than sort of mainstream  agriculture, but I think we need to allow the animals  to teach each other how to forage and how to recognize  
**[0:26:11-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:11):**  the plants that they should be eating and so forth.  And, you know, I'm often debating with my husband  about whether this group of cattle should be back together  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:21):**  with this group of cattle or whatever,  because we have it all, you know,  divided down by nutritional needs as we perceive them  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:26):**  and so forth.  And I keep thinking like,  I would like to see more intergenerational education  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:32):**  going on.  That's probably sounds kind of, people are thinking,  oh, she's one of those hippies from California  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:37):**  when I'm talking about that stuff.  But I actually think there's a lot more to that  than we tend to wanna think.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:43):**  And as someone who's, you know, trained in biology myself  and having been around animals for my whole life,  not farming, but just farming for the last 20 years.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:26:53):**  But I believe more and more in this idea  that there's a lot happening in nature  that we've been ignoring, you know,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:00):**  for the last 50 years in agriculture.  And I think having healthy animal,  giving animals what they need to be healthy  
**[0:27:09-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:09):**  without us providing, you know,  all kinds of, you know, supplements or drugs or chemicals,  having them learn how to be whatever species they are  
**[0:27:20-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:20):**  from the prior generation is probably a really good idea.  As difficult as that is from an agricultural standpoint,  you know, making that happen.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:29):**  I mean, it's a big shift from the way most animals  are being raised today, but I think,  and I watch it all the time with our cattle,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:33):**  how much communication is happening with, you know,  the mother cows and their calves.  And wouldn't it be sensible to have that kind of system  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:44):**  in all the species?  That would be great.  And, you know, I think there's something to that  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:50):**  about passing down not just, you know,  the epigenetic effects while that fetus is in utero  about all the nutritional information  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:27:59):**  the mother's passing on.  I think that was something else I learned  from Fred Provenza, who we'll have to get Fred  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:04):**  on the show, CK.  Yes, yes you do.  He's amazing.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:10):**  So like our experience here at the house with chickens, okay?  We've got a couple of chickens that we raised  from chicks last year, and they're pretty good.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:19):**  We've got some chickens that we got from a neighbor  that has a feedlot in his backyard,  has a lot of preconditioning and is pretty kind of  
**[0:28:27-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:27):**  on the conventional side, if you catch them on drift.  And they're kind of not the healthiest birds in the world.  And then we've got some eggs that were saved  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:38):**  from our chickens last year, fertilized by our rooster.  So we got all these like weird,  we have nine weird crossbreed chickens,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:45):**  like no clue what they are.  Two of them are kind of Brahmas.  There's two of them that are kind of Brahma influenced.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:50):**  There's a barred rock looking thing.  And then the other ones is like,  we don't know where that one came from.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:28:57):**  But I've noticed that the chickens  that we hatched from last year's eggs,  they hustle a little harder.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:29:07):**  They work a little harder to try to go find forage.  And they don't eat maybe as much chicken feed  as the big chickens even per pound.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:29:17):**  So, you know, and I've read the meat racket a couple of times,  listen to it.  And he talks a lot about how Tyson took over  
**[0:29:33-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:29:33):**  the chicken industry.  And it was enabled by a very select set of genetics  that did really well and consistently on that kind of feed.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:29:45):**  And there's something to be said about, you know,  are we really,  are we breeding animals that can only survive  
**[0:29:53-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:29:53):**  with a lot of artificial supports and subsidized energy?  Or are we breeding animals that can be successful  in the natural environment without a lot of supports?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:05):**  And it's, we definitely see it in cattle too.  Yeah, well, and I actually talked about this issue  quite a bit in my first book, Righteous Pork Job,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:16):**  because I was asking this whole question of how did we get  to this very industrialized place in agriculture  and especially in animal husbandry.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:25):**  And there's no question that there have been  all these decisions made, you know, with pigs, for example,  there was a very conscious choice to basically breed out  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:34):**  the fat because it was considered something  that wasn't very valuable.  And that at a certain point, in fact,  
**[0:30:39-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:39):**  when people stopped using lard that much  in baking and cooking, it became to the point  where it was a waste product.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:47):**  I mean, the fat had at one point been quite valuable,  and then it became less and less valuable.  So the feeling was, well, when you're feeding pigs  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:30:54):**  and they're just putting a bunch of fat on,  that's very wasteful, that's, you know, quote unquote,  inefficient. Right.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:00):**  But then what happens is the animal is not really capable  of being outdoors.  And so that's why there's been that huge interest in,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:07):**  you know, the resurgence and interest in the heritage breeds  for pigs and all of the Nyman Ranch farmers that I've been  on a lot of the farms of Nyman Ranch farmers who raised pigs  
**[0:31:16-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:16):**  and all of them use something other than  the modern white pig, you know, so they might use,  like you were saying, Brian Crosses and different things  
**[0:31:26-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:26):**  that are not necessarily, you know, one of the really  well-known heritage breeds, or they might be using  a heritage breed, but they all tell me that that fat  
**[0:31:36-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:36):**  that is missing in the modern pig is incredibly important,  not just for the cold, but even for the heat.  The animal is more capable of surviving any sort of  
**[0:31:45-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:45):**  fluctuations in temperature when it has some body fat on it.  That might be a good lesson for all of us humans too.  Don't be so afraid to have a little bit of body fat on you,  
**[0:31:54-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:31:54):**  you know, probably that's not valuable.  Thanks for you.  But that whole idea that, you know, you're gonna have this  
**[0:32:03-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:03):**  temperature controlled environment for these animals,  they're gonna always be in one place, you know,  they're not gonna waste quote unquote,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:11):**  any calories by being allowed to move around, you know,  I think a lot of these ideas just really need to be  re-examined, just the fundamental notion of how we're,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:21):**  you know, what's appropriate when we're raising animals.  And when we started raising turkeys, we decided right away  that we were gonna do it with the old breeds because  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:34):**  we knew we were gonna have them outdoors,  we wanted them to do a lot of foraging and we also had talked  to a lot of people who had raised turkeys and had been  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:41):**  involved in the turkey industry and they said that  essentially the modern turkey is not really able to,  doesn't have the knowledge about how to escape from  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:48):**  predators and so forth.  And they can't even fly.  So if they wanted to try to get up into a tree, for example,  
**[0:32:54-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:32:54):**  to avoid a predator, they wouldn't be able to do it  literally physically, they'd be incapable of doing it.  So I think, you know, these are the kinds of things that  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:03):**  agriculture has been doing for a long, long time.  They're big changes that happen.  It's gonna take a while to undo a lot of these things.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:11):**  But I think that we should be undoing these things because  we need to have animals that can be healthy,  just based on, you know, their basic physiology and the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:23):**  natural environment that we're providing them rather than,  you know, just creating a human constructed environment  that gets an animal that doesn't get sick.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:31):**  And I mean, I think what we're seeing now,  obviously the pandemic right now is, you know,  there's debate about its origins,

**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:46):**  there are scares going on all the time with different kinds  of bird flu and swine flu,  not just wiping out massive numbers of animals,  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:33:53):**  but also even crossing over into human populations  and even human to human transmission.  And when that, every time those cases occur,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:01):**  most of them are in Asia.  But when those happen,  there's a kind of a panic within the whole public health  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:08):**  community, because they know there's a potential  for a pandemic, you know,  as there has been in the past with swine flu and so forth.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:15):**  So these are really important big picture issues.  I think that humans need to be thinking about when we're  talking about animals that we raise for food,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:24):**  because I think the healthiest humans,  I write about this in Defending Beef,  the healthiest humans actually do live with animals  
**[0:34:33-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:33):**  and live alongside them.  You know, we've gotten resistance to a lot of different  types of illnesses by virtue of our proximity to living  
**[0:34:41-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:41):**  alongside of animals.  And we know that asthma is much less prevalent among  children and then people that were reared on farms and just  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:50):**  have access to,  even just having a pet helps you have a lower risk of asthma.  But if you have far,  
**[0:34:55-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:34:55):**  if you're living on a farm or have regular regularly,  regularly spend time on a farm,  you have a much lower risk of having food allergies or asthma.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:04):**  And those are sort of modern examples of how it benefits  humans to be around animals.  So I think it's not that we don't want to have that  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:14):**  proximity to them,  but we shouldn't be having the animals live in such  environments that is unhealthy for them or for us  
**[0:35:21-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:21):**  potentially, you know, that cross crossing into humans from  the animal population.  So, you know,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:29):**  people weren't thinking about that very much.  I don't think a few decades ago when these systems were  designed, but I think now these things are more clear.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:37):**  And so I think these large scale,  especially total confinement, you know,  feed lots are one thing for cattle. I have, you know,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:44):**  concerns about those, but to me,  a much greater concern is these total confinement systems  for poultry and pigs,  
**[0:35:50-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:35:50):**  because they're truly breeding grounds for really virulent  diseases, both for animals and humans.  And I think that is something that we have to recognize and  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:01):**  get away from.  You know,  once I started realizing how bad that total confinement  
**[0:36:09-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:09):**  model of chicken and pork is,  we shifted our buying habits.  We quit buying those products at the store and made sure  
**[0:36:18-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:18):**  we were buying those from a regenerative producer.  And I don't know what else to say other than, you know,  the conditions inside of one of those, you know,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:29):**  there's a reason that that freedom to farm act was passed so  they could keep, you know,  so they could lock cameras out of places like those.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:39):**  And yeah, as, as we like to say here on this show,  shake the hand that feeds you encourage everybody to shake  the hand that feeds you, because when you're doing that,  
**[0:36:49-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:36:49):**  like if you have a personal relationship with a person  that's growing your food, they're not going to grow you,  something or sell you something that is substandard quality  
**[0:37:00-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:00):**  or not grown with the love that it should have been.  You know, when those pigs or chickens are overseen by a  minimum wage slave working for Tyson or Smithfield.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:11):**  There's no integrity built into that, right?  Yeah, there's, they don't care.  They're just there for, they're just there for a job.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:16):**  As long as they meet their quotas,  they're not going to get fired.  So how, how can we start dismantling the current system?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:26):**  Actually, that's probably the wrong question.  How do we have those conversations with,  with people who don't understand what we know?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:33):**  Yeah, I mean, we're, we're not going to break,  we're not going to break up the packers.  We're not going to change the system.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:38):**  The only thing we can do is build a better one from the  ground up that takes its place. So how do we start?  How do we start having those conversations with the general  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:48):**  public that doesn't know any better?  Well, I think actually,  I think having a conversation within agriculture is  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:37:56):**  incredibly important and that is happening. And I'm,  I'm really heartened by that, to be honest.  20 years ago when I started working on this, you know,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:04):**  the ideas that, you know,  the mainstream meat industry was problematic.  That was just kind of radical, you know,  
**[0:38:10-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:10):**  in a lot of circles in agriculture and you were considered  an animal rights activist questioning the way modern meat  was happening. And I think now 20 years on,  
**[0:38:19-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:19):**  the good news is that there's a lot of attention being paid  to the fact that this is problematic and that it's, you know,  not a good life for the animals, that it causes, you know,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:29):**  food safety concerns that it causes health, you know,  like we're just talking about crossing the, you know,  from animal to human disease concerns.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:36):**  So I think there's been a spotlight from a lot of different  sources that have been focused on modern meat production.  And I think that's good. So,  
**[0:38:45-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:45):**  and I think there are a lot of people within agriculture  beginning to say, you know what, this is not,  we want to move away from these kinds of systems.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:53):**  I don't, you know,  people in agriculture tend to be quite conservative,  you know, so I don't hear a lot of people talking about like  
**[0:38:58-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:38:58):**  the major one day to the next wholesale revolution.  But I do hear, you know, I was sitting next to Gabe Brown,  you know, who to me is one of the most important sort of  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:11):**  profits for truly regenerative agriculture  and really remaking agriculture.  I was sitting next to him,  
**[0:39:17-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:17):**  we had just done a panel together at the Acres Conference  in Kentucky a couple of years ago.  And I was selling the original Defending Beef  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:28):**  and I signed a couple of books and I sold, I don't know,  you know, a dozen books or whatever.  And there was a line,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:34):**  like 50 people long for Gabe Brown and his book,  because people were like so interested  in what he had to say.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:42):**  Now the Acres Conference of course is already a place  where people that are, you know,  not practicing mainstream agriculture necessarily  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:48):**  are going to be gathered, but still there's a,  he's told me that he's been, you know,  asked to speak all over the world  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:39:55):**  and has done a lot of speaking all over the world,  because so many people want to know what he's done  and how he's done it.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:01):**  And so that to me is the kind of thing that suggests  that there's a real interest within farming and ranching  of doing something different and doing it better.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:10):**  So I think that's really important.  Second thing, I think every human that eats,  which is all of us,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:16):**  we can take steps to feed ourselves in a better way  and make sure that we're giving our bodies  what they really need through our food  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:23):**  and giving the children that we're feeding  or whoever we're feeding better food,  by getting better food.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:28):**  And I like this shake the hand that feeds you kind of idea.  That's exactly how I also try to encourage people to shop  and look for food and get out of the grocery store.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:38):**  I always say, you know,  try to find stuff in your community,  try to find places where you can either directly purchase  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:44):**  from the farmer, whether it's a farm stand  or a farmer's market or whatever,  or, you know, a sharing program,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:50):**  like a CSA type of whatever,  there are lots of ways to access food  and just think of gathering your food  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:40:57):**  as kind of a foraging process  where you get it from a lot of different places  and you get it as directly as possible from the source.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:04):**  And it sounds overwhelming to do that  if you're not someone who is already doing that.  So I always tell people just start one thing at a time,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:12):**  like get better eggs, you know,  find a place where there's somebody raising pasture  raised eggs in their backyard or wherever,  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:19):**  and start buying directly from them.  And you'll begin to notice how much better those taste.  And if you do any reading about it,  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:26):**  you'll learn that there's far more vitamins  and minerals in those eggs and a higher protein quality.  Everything's better about those eggs.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:32):**  So then you're gonna start feeling like it's worth it  for the effort and the money.  And then you're gonna wanna do more like that.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:38):**  So I think just one step at a time,  getting better food and to me, cooking more.  I think having all of us,  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:47):**  I mean, that was one of the upsides of the pandemic  is people did slow down  and did a lot more cooking and baking.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:41:53):**  And I think it got a lot of people thinking a lot more  about what they were eating and where it came from  and how it was prepared.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:00):**  But we're also citizens.  So I always think the other piece of that is for people to,  whenever they have an opportunity,  
**[0:42:07-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:07):**  when they're interacting with,  you know, their elected representatives on any level,  whether it's a city commissioner or a county commissioner  
**[0:42:15-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:15):**  or a Congress person or a Senator, whatever it is,  to let them know that you care about these issues.  You know, you care about regenerative farming,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:27):**  you care about high quality food  and things that are not contaminated with,  you know, for example, antibiotic residues  
**[0:42:34-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:34):**  or antibiotic resistant pathogens,  you know, the European Union passed a law like 15 years ago  saying you can't continuously feed antibiotics to animals  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:43):**  in livestock production, but the US still allows that.  And we've been, you know,  the Congress has taken up that law year after year  
**[0:42:49-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:49):**  and it's never passed.  So that's the kind of thing that I think that we can,  as citizens, tell our representatives we wanna see,  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:42:56):**  and that really helps level the playing field.  That's what that law is all about.  It says basically nobody's allowed to do this.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:02):**  So when you have the person that you're shaking their hand  and getting your food from them,  they're probably not doing that,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:09):**  but they're having to pay more to produce their meat  because they're not doing that.  And other people are essentially feeding,  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:16):**  you know, I use that word in quotes  because they're doing something that's legal,  at least in the United States,  
**[0:43:21-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:21):**  but it's basically a crutch, you know,  it's a way of kind of short-cutting the natural process  that would normally lead to animal growth  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:31):**  and animals being raised for meat  and trying to shorten the time between birth and slaughter  weight, and that's giving them a competitive advantage  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:39):**  that really they shouldn't have  because that causes public health problems,  that causes animal welfare and health problems,  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:45):**  and ultimately it causes human health problems too.  So if we get rid of those kinds of things,  you know, there are some places like laws  
**[0:43:52-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:43:52):**  that can do that kind of thing,  and then we all, you know, just use our voices  and our shopping dollars to support better systems.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:01):**  I think we can move pretty dramatically  in a better direction.  I mean, I think there's a big difference right now  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:06):**  between where things were 20 years ago  when I started working on this and where they are today.  So I have, I'd like to see things move faster,  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:13):**  you know, for sure, but I have a lot of optimism  that things are gonna continue changing  pretty dramatically in the next decade or so.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:21):**  You know, we're talking about, you know,  some of the drugs, the performance-enhancing drugs,  you know, let's kind of lump growth hormones  
**[0:44:31-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:31):**  and mass antibiotic feeds,  you know, kind of lump all that into one.  And I don't have a lot of experience with that,  
**[0:44:40-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:40):**  because that's never been my program  or any part of the program on the ranch.  But, you know, going, some of the visits I've done lately  
**[0:44:49-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:49):**  and some of the other cattle I've been around  that, you know, have had growth hormones in them,  man, that can cause some behavioral issues.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:44:58):**  That can really mess up a steer's brain  having a couple of those implants shoved in his ear.  You know, we gotta think about what that's doing,  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:07):**  you know, what that's doing to our meat.  And, you know, the sad thing is,  if you go anywhere and question any of this stuff  
**[0:45:14-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:14):**  in our industry, like, you know, when a cow gets off,  when a steer gets off the truck in a feedlot,  they get a shot of Batril 200 or a shot of Draxone  
**[0:45:23-0:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:23):**  before they ever hit a pin.  Like, why are we doing that?  Why are we doing these growth hormones?  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:30):**  Why do we need these ionic pores?  If you question any of that stuff to another cattleman,  you get looked at like you're crazy  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:37):**  and told that you don't wanna make money,  because that's how it has to be.  And then the next thing out of their mouth is,  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:43):**  well, that's safe.  So science says that it's safe.  Well, science also says that glyphosate is safe.  
**[0:45:51-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:45:51):**  You know, science also says that at one point  it said DDT was okay.  So you can't really have your cake and eat it too.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:01):**  You either gotta question a lot of stuff  or you've gotta accept everything blindly  and go down that road.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:07):**  Yeah, because if you start acknowledging, right,  if you're in kind of the mainstream system  and you start questioning or acknowledging  
**[0:46:15-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:15):**  that there are some problems or some legitimate concerns,  then all of a sudden everything you're doing is problematic  because the whole system is so based on that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:23):**  So I know, and then you have to go into a completely  kind of alternative track, right, with what you're doing  and where you're selling your meat  
**[0:46:31-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:31):**  and trying to get a premium for it and so forth.  But I think, again, I believe there are some major shifts  in thinking, my husband, Bill Nyman,  
**[0:46:40-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:40):**  who founded the Nyman Ranch Network,  always says that when he used to talk about antibiotic-free  when he started doing this, like 40 years ago,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:48):**  people thought he was, again,  kind of a hippie from California and nuts  and what do you, that's all bullshit kind of thing.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:46:55):**  And now, everybody's talking about antibiotic-free.  I mean, that's a long time to make that kind of a shift.  But I think there's just been a general movement  
**[0:47:05-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:05):**  away from the idea that everything's okay  because USDA says, or the Lankwright University  says it's okay because I think more and more people realize  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:17):**  that Monsanto and the big pharmaceutical companies  are funding the research at those places  and they're funding the chairmanships and the departments.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:24):**  And not to criticize the professors,  I have met many of them who are very frustrated  by the system and many of them who have taken a lot of risk  
**[0:47:33-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:33):**  to speak out against all of this,  but essentially, big corporations are funding universities  now and in all of it in agriculture and food science  
**[0:47:43-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:43):**  and health and nutrition.  All of the money, right?  Yeah, and there's a lot that Marian Nestle says  
**[0:47:51-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:51):**  that I don't fully agree with,  but she does a really, really good job  of highlighting the connections between the food industry  
**[0:47:59-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:47:59):**  and especially the processed food industry  and all of the sort of educating around diet and nutrition.  So it's been super interesting to me to realize  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:10):**  that probably the core problem that we have in health today,  diet-related diseases and health problems,  is related to processed food  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:19):**  and how much processed food people are eating.  And yet a mainstream dietician  will hardly ever point that out  
**[0:48:25-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:25):**  because their whole education has been funded  by the processed food industry.  And the profit is in the processing.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:34):**  So that's where the food industry is making their money.  And so they've, and I'm not saying  this is necessarily done intentionally  
**[0:48:41-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:41):**  on the part of nutrition-trained people and dieticians,  but they've never really been taught to question  that whole notion that there's something  
**[0:48:50-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:50):**  necessarily problematic about processed foods.  And yet to me, more and more I'm convinced,  and sort of going back to the Defending Beef book,  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:48:59):**  the first book I talked about this issue,  but in the second book, I talked about it a lot more  because I've been, I think there's more and more  
**[0:49:06-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:06):**  really good science emerging showing that the key problem  in the modern diet is how much processed food  people are eating.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:14):**  And the key solution for an individual  is to reduce how much processed food they're eating.  So, you know, like I eat pasta.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:23):**  So I mean, you know, I eat some processed food.  It's not that I don't eat any, but I have, you know,  just take taking pasta as an example,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:31):**  I used to eat pasta sometimes like five nights a week,  you know, I don't do that anymore.  I'd much rather have a potato.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:38):**  And I actually, we grow our own potatoes.  So I can take a potato out of the earth and eat it,  you know, within a few hours of when it was harvested  
**[0:49:46-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:46):**  versus a box of pasta, which came from God knows where,  you know, and I try to buy organic, just about everything,  but still you don't know where it came from,  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:49:57):**  when it was harvested, how much it was processed,  who, you know, where it went  and how long it took to get to you.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:02):**  And this is something, you know,  you don't know anything about any of the provenance  of anything you're eating when it comes  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:07):**  from a grocery store, pretty much,  and especially processed foods.  And I just try more and more to eat, you know,  
**[0:50:13-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:13):**  like Fred Provenza says, using my nutritional wisdom,  using real food that my body recognizes  and knows what it needs.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:21):**  And that whole idea is something  that you would never be taught, I don't think,  in the vast majority of diet and nutrition programs  
**[0:50:29-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:29):**  in the United States today,  because the processed food industry does not want anyone  to believe that or to be espousing that approach.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:38):**  So, you know, there's a, we have big problems  with the way food and diet are, you know,  talked about and are understood in this country  
**[0:50:48-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:48):**  and there's a lot to do to fix it.  But we shouldn't get discouraged  because there is more happening now, I think,  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:50:57):**  than there has been in any time in recent history,  partly just because there's, you know,  we've kind of reached a critical point.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:02):**  I mean, there are so many people  that have diet-related diseases  and there's so much evidence, you know,  
**[0:51:09-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:09):**  about the long-term impacts of industrial agriculture  on the land and on soil health and, you know,  obviously people are facing drought,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:17):**  we're in a drought place right where I am  and it is on much of the globe, actually.  And so I think we are kind of being forced to re-examine,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:26):**  like, okay, what are we doing,  what's the impact we're doing, you know,  of mainstream agriculture on the land  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:33):**  and how can we shift it  so that we have a better effect on the land?  And then in terms of health, you know,  
**[0:51:39-0:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:39):**  we have this, you know, really large number of people  in the world and Western world, especially,  that are facing diet-related diseases.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:47):**  So what can we do, you know,  to make food better and diets healthier?  And so I think there's more interest  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:51:56):**  in really reevaluating this than there has been  in any time, probably ever.  You know, there is a great book that came out  
**[0:52:03-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:03):**  in the last year called Metabolical.  I forget who wrote it, but have you read it?  No, I think that was by Dr. Robert Lustig.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:12):**  I think that's his new book, right?  Yes, yes. Pretty sure.  Yes, and it- I saw it come out  
**[0:52:16-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:16):**  and I put it on my to-read list,  but I have not read it yet.  Well, he likes to say that it's not the food,  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:24):**  it's what's been done to the food.  He talks a lot about processed food  and some of the ingredients that are  
**[0:52:30-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:30):**  in heavily processed food and what's not there.  And let's see, he says that your eating choices  should be protect the liver and feed the gut.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:46):**  No, very, very intentional choices to protect the liver.  And there's a whole chapter, I think he talks about it  for like an hour and a half about what you should not eat  
**[0:52:55-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:52:55):**  because it makes your liver toxic.  One of the other key insights that he also had in the book  that you almost skipped over earlier is that animal fat  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:07):**  is starting to be discovered to be critical  to brain function.  Like our brains are powered by animal fat.

**[0:53:20-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:20):**  That they bred this crossbreed white pig  that needed to live in a barn and get fed a ration  and it did okay on it because heritage breeds  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:29):**  had too much fat and that was a waste product  because there wasn't a demand for lard.  Right.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:35):**  We've started cooking with lard again  and lots of real grass butter.  Lard from grass fed pigs is actually pretty decent.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:44):**  It's a good way to get that type of nutrition  or get oil to fry something on.  We eat a lot of fried food, but I think it's good for you  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:53):**  if you fry it in lard or real butter.  Absolutely.  And also ghee.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:53:58):**  I had never used ghee until about a year ago or so,  but I discovered it from talking with Chris Kresser,  who's an amazing person in functional medicine  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:08):**  and diet and health.  And he explains the reason you wanna use ghee  is because it doesn't have the solids  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:13):**  that butter have in it when you're at high temperatures.  Right, it's clear.  So it's a great addition.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:18):**  I use ghee, I use butter,  I use pig fat, beef fat.  I use pretty much all the animal fats.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:27):**  I also use some coconut oil and some olive oil,  but that's pretty much it.  I don't use really any other,  
**[0:54:33-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:33):**  I don't use canola oil or any of those other things  that we're told are healthier alternatives  because I actually don't want to have my foods  
**[0:54:41-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:41):**  coming from industrial processes and industrial farms.  And that's where I know all that canola oil comes from.  And I've increased,  
**[0:54:50-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:50):**  I actually did a really interesting panel.  I was the moderator for a panel  at the True Cost of American Food Conference  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:54:56):**  a few years ago here in San Francisco,  which was hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust.  And I put together a group of people  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:02):**  to talk about the fats issue,  that very question of where we get our fats  and what it means.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:07):**  And Patrick Holden,  the founder of the Sustainable Food Trust  had come up with,  
**[0:55:12-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:12):**  had said something that I thought was so amazing.  He said, we're getting the fat off of their land  in the modern system.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:19):**  So we are going to Southeast Asia  and we're destroying the,  we're creating plantations for palm oil  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:27):**  and we're destroying the natural rainforest there  in order to create palm oil  because we don't want to eat the lard and the tallow  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:34):**  and the schmaltz anymore.  And it's so ridiculous  because it's all because of this idea  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:39):**  that those foods are unhealthy for you,  which I know,  which I think Nina Teicholz did a brilliant job  
**[0:55:45-0:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:45):**  of completely blasting in her book,  The Big Fat Surprise,  where she shows that essentially the whole science,  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:52):**  claiming that fat was bad for you is really suspect.  And the conclusions that you should be avoiding it  and you should be eating  
**[0:55:59-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:55:59):**  these supposedly healthier alternatives.  There's really not good science for that whole idea.  And yet we've pretty much all accepted that.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:06):**  We Americans, you know.  Without question.  Fat is bad, carbs are okay.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:12):**  Pardon me?  Fat is bad, carbs are okay,  sugar's not horrible.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:17):**  I mean, and we now know that's completely false too.  So, you know, I always liked the picture of the cover  of Gary Taubes' book, Good Calories, Bad Calories,  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:27):**  where he has a picture of the toast on the cover  and there's a big pad of butter  and your brain thinks, oh right,  
**[0:56:33-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:33):**  that whole wheat slice of bread is a good calorie  and that butter is a bad calorie.  And the book totally flips it on its head  
**[0:56:40-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:40):**  and says basically, no, the butter is the good calorie.  The whole wheat bread is the bad calorie.  But, you know, I think there's just a lot  
**[0:56:48-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:48):**  that's being re-examined in so much of what we were kind  of told was true in the last couple of decades  about dietary science and also about nutrition science.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:56:57):**  And I actually added a whole big discussion  on the new defending beef, just raising the question  of how it's all conducted and how credible it is  
**[0:57:06-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:06):**  because there is really good discussion out there  in some of the medical and scientific literature  saying that essentially almost all dietary science  
**[0:57:18-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:18):**  is not very good because the way it has to be conducted,  it's really hard to do it, you know,  is like food frequency questionnaires, for example.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:27):**  And so you ask someone, what did you eat last week?  And they're sitting there going, my God,  I don't even remember what I ate yesterday,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:32):**  but here's what I think.  And that's how they base these studies on a lot of times.  And then they also do a lot of self-reporting  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:38):**  and people are like, did I eat ice cream last night?  Uh, no, no, I didn't.  I just have no idea.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:42):**  No, I didn't have those three scoops.  No.  It's just not credible.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:48):**  You know, and there's really good work  that's been done in this now to show  that the vast majority of this so-called dietary science  
**[0:57:57-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:57:57):**  is not very scientific.  And so to me, more and more, I'm convinced  that just kind of trying to think about sort of going back  
**[0:58:07-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:07):**  to Fred Provenza again, what would our bodies tell us  that we needed and what does our physiology demand?  And to me, that's really closely connected to evolution.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:16):**  You know, how did we evolve?  What were we eating as we evolved?  Obviously, our modern foods are incredibly different  
**[0:58:22-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:22):**  than what we would have had access to 10,000 years ago.  But nonetheless, we can try to seek out  foods that are similar to how we were always  
**[0:58:32-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:32):**  powered as humans in our evolutionary history.  And animal foods were part of it for at least 3 million years.  And we now know that.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:42):**  And so to me, that tells you that that's  an important part of it.  And then some 80,000 other types of foods  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:50):**  were involved historically in the foraging  of people of the world over.  So we know we ate very diverse diets.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:58:56):**  And we know that we ate roots and seeds and nuts and plants  and eggs and leafy greens.  And we ate whatever we could get, basically.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:06):**  Humans, in my view, are absolutely clearly omnivores.  And so diverse diets.  But it's all stuff that comes directly  
**[0:59:14-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:14):**  from the earth or the sea or the ground or the whatever,  the tree, wherever.  And that's where we get what our body needs,  
**[0:59:23-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:23):**  is by getting that food from that place, the earth  or the tree or the water.  And when we eat a processed food,  
**[0:59:33-0:59:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:33):**  basically, it's biologically dead food.  And so to me, the cornerstone of reclaiming a healthy diet  is trying to get as much as possible into your diet  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:44):**  every day that either you raised it yourself.  It's from your own garden.  It's from your own farm or ranch.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:50):**  It's from the person down the street that has a farm stand  or has a backyard chicken flock, whatever.  And just try to get as much of that as possible  
**[0:59:57-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=0:59:57):**  into your daily diet.  Shake the hand that feeds you.  Exactly.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:04):**  So even if it's your own.  Yeah.  So as we head downhill to the last part of the show,  
**[1:00:12-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:12):**  there's two directions we could go.  We can talk about economics of food production,  or we can talk about climate change and carbon.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:23):**  OK.  Well, I'm up for either.  But I do like talking about climate change.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:28):**  Let's do climate change and carbon.  So all right.  OK.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:31):**  So all right.  Let me give me a second to dream up a question here.  So carbon storage is a thing.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:41):**  And there's an emerging carbon markets.  And if you don't want to talk about a specific carbon  program because of participation or something else,  
**[1:00:53-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:00:53):**  that's fine.  But it seems like there's not much consistency  between some of them.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:01):**  So on a 30,000 foot view, what are some of the carbon programs  that you're kind of familiar with?  And what are some of the pitfalls  
**[1:01:10-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:10):**  that we need to watch out for?  Well, I mean, my background as an environmental lawyer,  there's been a lot of things I've  
**[1:01:20-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:20):**  been exposed to over the years where  I've seen where they're trying to basically do cap and trade  and all kinds of markets for carbon where you have,  
**[1:01:29-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:29):**  essentially, you're reimbursed for creating carbon or getting  carbon in the soil, for example, by someone else that's  emitting carbon from the fossil fuel industry or whatever.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:41):**  And there's been some funding that's  gone from the fossil fuel industry  into some of the carbon soil programs in agriculture.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:48):**  And I'm kind of two minds on that.  On the one hand, I'm thrilled that there's  resources that are being put into anything  
**[1:01:57-1:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:01:57):**  that incentivizes the return of carbon into the soil.  On the other hand, I really think, first of all,  the fossil fuel industry is, in fact, the gorilla in the room,  
**[1:02:08-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:08):**  the giant elephant in the room when  you talk about climate change.  It is really the key source.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:13):**  And there's a lot of discussion about, especially like beef  being a source of methane or whatever.  But when you really look at the numbers,  
**[1:02:22-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:22):**  it's really clear that the fossil fuel industry  is the primary driver of carbon dioxide emissions.  And that's because that's where it all comes from.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:34):**  I mean, without access to a cheap, energy-dense source  that we can transport, there's a lot  of things that just don't simply work anymore in our economy.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:46):**  And that's kind of the scary part.  Like, if they take this carbon tax all the way back  to the wellhead, which is where it should be,  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:02:54):**  then everybody pays their fair share for consumption  down the line.  How bad is that going to affect the economics of food  
**[1:03:01-1:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:03:01):**  production?  Well, that's a really interesting point.  Because the more dependent you are on fossil fuel production

**[1:03:15-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:03:15):**  and in terms of their processes to produce them.  We know that more industrialized food production  is much more dependent on machinery and automation.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:03:25):**  We know that there's a great deal more transport  that happens with industrialized food production.  So there are many steps along the way  
**[1:03:32-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:03:32):**  in what I would think of as kind of the global or industrialized  food system that would be dramatically affected  by carbon taxing or whatever.  
**[1:03:44-1:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:03:44):**  I think, ultimately, I am more interested in helping  and incentivizing people that want  to move towards systems that are going to sequester carbon.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:00):**  Because I feel that, I mean, I'm totally in favor  of going after the fossil fuel industry in terms of making  them pay their true costs.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:12):**  But what I don't like, every time you start talking  about taxing things, people immediately  start talking about how farmers and especially people rearing  
**[1:04:21-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:21):**  cattle are going to have to pay a lot because there's methane  and so forth.  And all of those things tend to be really myopic in terms  
**[1:04:29-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:29):**  of even how they're measuring what the, I mean,  especially when you're talking about cattle,  I talk about this a lot in the new Defending Beef book.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:37):**  There's a very, very good discussion in my book.  Or I shouldn't say very good.  I want to say my book is so great.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:45):**  But there's a very in-depth, let's put it that way.  It's more neutral.  There's a very in-depth discussion  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:51):**  in my book about methane from cattle  and why it's completely misunderstood  in terms of the way it's being talked about now.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:04:57):**  Because in fact, methane is a very short-lived gas.  And where you have, we've always had  ruminants on the globe.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:08):**  And there's a historic load of methane  that has come from ruminants.  And there's actually no evidence at all  
**[1:05:16-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:16):**  that we're increasing the amount of methane coming  from ruminants on the globe.  And there are, in fact, there are fewer ruminants  
**[1:05:24-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:24):**  on the globe today than there were historically.  So I think it's not sensible to focus  on the specific output of an individual farmer or rancher  
**[1:05:37-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:37):**  raising cattle because there's methane connected  with that system when you really don't understand  the whole biology of how methane breaks down  
**[1:05:47-1:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:47):**  and how methane is returned to the ecosystem.  Whereas when you extract, whether it's  natural gas or anything you're extracting  
**[1:05:57-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:05:57):**  in terms of the fossil fuel industry,  you are causing the emission of a lot of carbon  that was actually deep in the ground  
**[1:06:07-1:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:07):**  prior to you doing that extraction and then  the burning of it.  And so I think there's a very different question involved  
**[1:06:14-1:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:14):**  in whether you're talking about methane or carbon dioxide,  whether you're talking about fossil fuel production  and agriculture.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:22):**  But for me, the really interesting idea  is let's actually regulate and let's actually measure.  I mean, I just recently learned that the methane that  
**[1:06:31-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:31):**  is emitted from natural gas production in Europe and in US  is not being measured in any kind of organized way,  and it is not being regulated.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:40):**  So I saw a report that was just published a couple of weeks  ago that for the first time actually  measured methane leaks in natural gas production  
**[1:06:52-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:52):**  in Europe.  And it was a shockingly high amount.  And they pointed out in this report that no one was  
**[1:06:59-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:06:59):**  measuring it and no one was regulating it.  And that's a kind of extraordinary thing  when you think there's all this focus on cattle.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:06):**  Look the other way.  Let's just look the other way.  I mean, if you don't acknowledge the problem,  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:12):**  you don't have to do anything about it.  Yeah.  Well, and the fossil fuel industry  
**[1:07:17-1:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:17):**  is incredibly politically powerful.  So we know this.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:20):**  And this is why things don't get measured  and they don't get regulated.  And so when you talk about taxing carbon or something,  
**[1:07:30-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:30):**  for me, it really depends on the situation.  And a methane leak is a really outrageous thing  because nobody benefits from that.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:38):**  That's not even good for the fossil fuel industry.  The only reason they're allowed to continue  is because it's expensive to cap them.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:44):**  But over the longer term, it's probably better for them  as well to preserve the methane, not to have the leaks.  And there's no good that comes from it.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:53):**  So there's no energy generated or anything from those leaks.  And we have a huge problem with methane leaks in the United  States as well.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:07:59):**  So I would like, from my work, what  I'm interested in focusing on is how can individual farmers  and ranchers improve what they're  
**[1:08:14-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:14):**  doing in terms of how much carbon they're getting  into the soil, how much diversity and life  they're building in their soils.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:20):**  And I think there's a role for government in that.  I think that there can be assistance.  There can be incentives.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:25):**  There can be rewards for doing that.  I'm a lot more interested in that kind of action  by the government instead of taxation.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:33):**  I actually don't really want to see people in agriculture tax.  I mean, it's a hard enough profession, as we all know.  Yeah, I'm not against any more taxation.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:43):**  Don't get me wrong.  Don't get me right.  Taxation is theft.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:45):**  We don't need any more of it.  We need less, and we need less government.  But how do we build a better food system without it?  
**[1:08:53-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:08:53):**  Yeah, well, I think there are lots of, I mean, I actually,  you know, my good friend, Gabe Brown,  says we don't really need government.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:01):**  He doesn't want to take any government subsidies  for agriculture.  And we don't, on our ranch, we don't directly  
**[1:09:06-1:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:06):**  take any government subsidies either.  But I actually do think if the government would,  we're doing it in California, for example,  
**[1:09:14-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:14):**  there are some laws now, some programs that  are going to be rewarding farmers for showing that they're  building carbon in their soils.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:21):**  I think that's the kind of program  that the government should be funding.  And I think that will benefit all of us  
**[1:09:26-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:26):**  if we have that kind of program in place.  So that's the kind of thing I think  would be really, really helpful.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:31):**  But also, most importantly, just help farmers to make a living  and start leveling the playing field.  Like I was saying before about the, you know,  
**[1:09:39-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:39):**  don't allow the antibiotics feeding  to be used because that makes it unfair for people that  are not doing that.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:45):**  That's the kind of stuff that, you know,  there's a positive role that government can have, I think,  and that will benefit all of us, will benefit  
**[1:09:52-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:09:52):**  the healthfulness of the food, will benefit the ecosystems,  will benefit human health.  You know, something else that I've learned about,  
**[1:10:02-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:02):**  and this is a little off track from where you were,  but my brain works a little funny sometimes,  it's about labels.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:09):**  Like the brighter, the flashier, the more attention-grabbing  the label is on that food.  And the more audacious claim that it  
**[1:10:19-1:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:19):**  makes about how nutritious it is,  the less you should want to purchase that.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:27):**  Well, I always like Michael Pollan's statement  that if it's not an ingredient that your grandmother would  recognize, you probably shouldn't be eating that food.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:34):**  So if it's a carrot, if it's butter, that's fine.  If it's some kind of weird soy protein isolate or something,  probably avoid that.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:49):**  I think that's a really great point.  That is a great point.  So have we left anything on the table today?  
**[1:10:56-1:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:10:56):**  Where can we find you on social media?  And where can our fans find you if they want to interact  with you a little more?  
**[1:11:03-1:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:03):**  Well, like I've been talking about,  I've written books, Righteous Pork Chop and Defending Beef,  which I certainly encourage people to read.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:10):**  And they're at a lot of libraries.  If your library doesn't have it and you don't want to buy it,  just ask your library to get a copy of it.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:17):**  And I have a very active social media presence.  Also, Defending Beef is a Facebook handle and also  a Twitter handle.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:25):**  So it's just Defending Beef.  And I certainly encourage people to follow us  because we do a lot of discussion there  
**[1:11:32-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:32):**  about all of the stuff we've been talking about today,  whether it's how to improve the health of your soil  or the healthier animals or produce better food  
**[1:11:42-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:42):**  or just eat better yourself.  All that stuff is stuff that we're talking about every day.  Good places.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:49):**  Awesome.  Awesome.  Before we get on out of here, is there  
**[1:11:52-1:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:52):**  anything you'd like to ask me or CK?  No, I just really appreciate the opportunity  to have a conversation with you all.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:11:59):**  And it's good work that all of us are in this together.  And I appreciate what you guys are doing.  And thank you so much for inviting me  
**[1:12:10-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:10):**  to be part of the conversation.  We both really appreciate you being here.  And it's been a wonderful afternoon.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:18):**  And thank you for your time.  OK, thank you.  Thanks for sticking around to the end, friends.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:24):**  I need to ask you for a couple of favors before you go.  The first thing, and this really helps more than you'd think,  I need you all to go to the Apple store or your podcast  
**[1:12:33-1:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:33):**  player and leave us a review.  Your feedback really matters.  The second thing is I need you to share your favorite episode  
**[1:12:40-1:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:40):**  with five of your friends and family.  Make sure you come back next week.  I'm letting CK take over.  
**[1:12:45-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/27-Nicolette-Hahn-Niman--a-Defender-of-Beef-e169k5t#t=1:12:45):**  Have a great week, gang.

**[0:00:53-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:00:53):**  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.  First off, happy Valentine's Day.  Second thing, this is our one year episode.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:02):**  We've been podcasting and doing this thing for one year.  And for those of you that have been along for the ride since the first, I can't thank  you enough.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:10):**  Due to a slight scheduling mishap with time zones, CK doesn't join us till about 20 minutes  in.  So watch for that.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:19):**  Without further ado, here's this week's episode.  We're like a 10th of the 2% of the total population and we're responsible for growing all, you  know, we're doing the regenerative work.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:34):**  And when you think about it, like, so what is 2% of 330 million?  And then we're a 10th of a percent of that.  It is a small community, but it's growing.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:47):**  I mean, it's growing constantly.  It's growing all the time.  And that, you know, that really gives me hope.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:52):**  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Well, and just the excitement of it, just kidding people.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:01:59):**  That's the thing you walk into a room like that and optimism and just the people looking  at it.  They're not just complaining about prices or the weather and whatever.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:09):**  It's everybody's like, okay, what are we going to do?  Here's the prices.  How do we work it?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:13):**  What do we do?  Here's the weather.  How do we work that?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:17):**  What are we going to do?  Doesn't do a whole lot of good to go to the coffee shop and complain about anything.  No, no.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:23):**  Maybe if you have a plan, then you can go complain, but you'll just end up listening  to everybody else's problems.  And that's not a good head space to go to.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:31):**  No.  Well, George, I appreciate you joining me this week.  And why don't you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about where you're at.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:40):**  We can kind of go from there.  Sounds good.  I'm George Walker.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:44):**  I'm up in Princeton, Minnesota, which is about an hour north of the Twin Cities.  If you know where the Twin Cities are in Minnesota.  About six years ago now, my wife and I moved.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:02:57):**  I actually was in Wisconsin for a lot of years.  We moved back and put our farms together with my brother.  So my brother and I own Walker Farms, LLC.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:03:08):**  We base out of the farm that we grew up on or what's left of that farm.  And then so it would be myself and my wife, my brother and his wife, and then my folks.  They live at the main farm.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:03:24):**  We do direct to consumer beef, pork, lamb, chicken.  We do do turkeys once a year just for Thanksgiving.  We sell some butter from a very, very small creamery just northwest of us, Millerville  
**[0:03:42-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:03:42):**  butter, but yeah, all of our stuff is done direct to consumer around about 300 acres  of leased land.  So that's kind of what we do.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:03:56):**  When I was in Wisconsin, I kind of wrote notes about it.  I mean, I went to Wisconsin to go to college for animal science at River Falls.  And I was going to move back home.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:08):**  I had a conversation with my dad and this is before they sold out.  He's like, well, you can come home, but we can't pay you.  And I thought, well, that's going to be a problem.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:21):**  That might not work.  No, that would make things a little difficult.  So I ended up staying there.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:28):**  I had done an apprenticeship when I was 15.  I had started a farrier apprenticeship, so shoeing horses.  And so by that time I had a pretty decent clientele going on and was able to get into  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:42):**  that world over.  And River Falls is a big equine area, a lot of eventing horses, barrel horses, I mean  all kinds.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:50):**  So I was shoeing horses full time, farming.  And at that time I did the grass-fed beef and pork and lamb, but I did it through a  CSA model.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:04:59):**  So you have subscriptions.  And at that time we delivered once a month, mainly into the south end of the Twin Cities  in the local area.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:09):**  So did that and was shoeing horses.  What else?  Ran trucks.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:15):**  I've done a lot of things, ran some semi trucks in the wintertime for eight years, actually.  I farmed with teams of horses.  Oh, really?  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:25):**  Yup.  So I've always kind of been in this deal, like, how do we do this?  And, you know, listening to this podcast and others, you know, it's like, we're trying  
**[0:05:33-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:33):**  to do this in the most holistic way we can.  The buzzword then of course was sustainable.  You know how that works.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:42):**  So I was looking for a way to how do I do this in a quote unquote sustainable manner  and had a local gentleman and said, well, you know, I'd like to learn how to drive teams.  So he taught me how to drive teams.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:05:55):**  I had four Belgians and ran the farm with four Belgians and one Alice Chalmers WD tractor.  I want to hear some more about that.  And we can circle back around later, but I want to hear some more about what it was like  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:06:12):**  farming with teams.  Yeah.  It was a fun eight years.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:06:18):**  If I could, I would do it again.  But the interesting thing is, is once you go from that point into the regenerative area,  we need so little traction as in, you know, tractors and stuff like that to run our place.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:06:32):**  Even teams, you always think, wow, because we're not feeding much in the winter.  You know, we're doing setting everything out.  We do bale grazing.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:06:39):**  We try to do it kind of Steve Kenyon style, throw names out there, but we don't get everything  out there in this fall.  Like we should, we still feed every few weeks.  
**[0:06:48-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:06:48):**  If you're going to name drop that one's okay.  Can you bleep out things?  So you just go, well, do I need, do I even need to be feeding these, you know, one ton  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:01):**  horses.  And then when we moved back here, I had sold one of my teams and then the other one I had  for a little while.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:08):**  And the gentleman that had bought my original team knew that I was thinking about selling  them.  He actually took them.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:15):**  I just gave them to him because they were older.  So they went, they went to haul people around at an apple orchard.  So it was a pretty good retirement.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:23):**  Interesting.  So you said that like your, your power requirements are so low that you could do it with, with  the four horse team, like, and that you're talking about like some light tillage.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:35):**  What were you using them for?  I guess is what I'm asking.  Well pre regenerative and understanding getting into that world, you know, with Gabe Brown  
**[0:07:46-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:46):**  and those guys, Ray, I actually did a little bit of tillage.  You know, I would plow with horses.  Had I known what I know now, I wouldn't have even done that, but I did mostly hay with  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:07:59):**  them.  I was running, Oh, about 80 acres of hay.  I did some loose hay.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:05):**  A lot of times what I would do is I would do the cutting with the horses and the raking,  and then I'd hire somebody to come and bail it.  And then they round bail it, and then I would, I had a big around bail mover that I could  
**[0:08:17-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:17):**  put on horses and call them a tumble bug.  If you've ever seen a tumble bug before they're meant to go behind pickups and they have electric  brakes on them.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:27):**  There's a video on YouTube.  If you look it up, I'm sure it's got a whole bunch of views of me taking them off of field  with a team.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:36):**  I'll try to find that and, uh, and put that link in the show notes.  Yeah.  It's a little bit different.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:41):**  It was a super enjoyable.  I mean, it was, but you know, how it goes, you pile all these things and you're shoeing  horses full time and you're, you know, in the wintertime I would run trucks and you  
**[0:08:52-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:08:52):**  know, you go, wow, should I, do I even need to be doing all this stuff?  And now where we're at now, we don't outside of a very, very, very small, I sold all my  equipment when I moved over to back home and we buy, you know, 95% of our, Hey, we do a  
**[0:09:09-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:09:09):**  little bit here and there's some stuff we lease that we don't have fence around, but  we just share equipment with a friend of ours that has a dairy.  So we don't, we don't have to have the Baylor another arm of our business.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:09:23):**  So, so we actually have a custom harvesting.  We have a combine truck and stuff like that, that that's a separate business though, from  the Walker Park, well, it's under Walker farms.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:09:35):**  It's a, uh, Rome river custom harvesting.  So that's my brother's gig.  He really heads that up, spearheads that my brother's that diesel mechanic by trade and  
**[0:09:46-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:09:46):**  you know, he loves running the combines and I love it when it's going good.  When it breaks down, usually I just call him, Hey, your machinery's broke down.  Come on over.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:09:55):**  No fix this stuff.  I'm going to go hang out with the cows for awhile.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:10:00):**  You know, I, I don't think there's anything wrong with, you know, participating in the  current system as it exists or taking advantage of, of conditions to be able to make a living.  That being said, you know, we also have to be trying to make progress forward, but you  
**[0:10:18-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:10:18):**  obviously are.  Yeah.  So it's one of those things we kind of stumbled into that, but there, we, we do a lot of,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:10:27):**  have you ever heard of Iowa cover crop by chance?  They're a cover crop seed company.  So there's the gentleman that owns it.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:10:37):**  My brother went to college with, and he, his grandma lives in Princeton.  So on the other side of town from us, and he is trying to get more ground up here because  we are, we're in a pretty light soil area and it's really good for the small grains.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:10:52):**  And so we're more or less contract with him to harvest all of his small grains for seed.  And then he trucks a lot of it down to Iowa.  We did something we're working on right now.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:11:03):**  We just picked up some more ground for doing that, but he's also on board with trying to  get the grazing animals out there.  It's just getting the landlords, you know, this, this current property that we're, that  
**[0:11:15-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:11:15):**  he's on right now, no fence around it.  And nobody out there thinks if you're, if they, if you're not living out there, they  don't think there should be animals out there, you know?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:11:25):**  So it's trying to teach people that, Hey, he, what he'd like to do is put the cover  crop like a rye or a spring wheat or something out there, take the seed, have a cover under  it for grazing, and then be able to winter graze in these properties.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:11:41):**  That's the ultimate goal with that.  That's interesting that the mindset is if there's nobody living there, they shouldn't  have animals on the property.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:11:52):**  That's that's really strange.  Well, especially from where you're at by us, you know, there's trees around there.  Our biggest pasture that we have right now is 60 acres of all the acres that we run.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:04):**  So we're moving animals, you know, around two of the properties we own are right next  to each other.  So we don't have to move them down the road necessarily.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:13):**  But and that's about 200 acres.  It's right there, the bulk of what we do, and that's five miles from where I live.  So and that's where the bulk of our animals are right now for the wintering.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:22):**  And so, you know, we're up there a couple times a day, I usually go and do chores in  the morning and my brother usually swings by at some point just to check on especially  right now when it's cold, you know, check on water and all that fun stuff.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:35):**  How cold is it up there?  This morning, it was 13 below when I got up.  And it wasn't windy yesterday.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:42):**  It was really windy, but 14 below.  I haven't seen that this year.  But last year during the big polar vortex, we had a low of 14 below and then southern  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:12:58):**  Kansas is not should not see that weather more than once every 10 years, I could promise  you it.  The ice was rough.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, we don't deal with too much of the ice except it did get about 38 here 3840 for a  day or two, and that snow kind of melted down.  And then I got really cold again.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:18):**  So now there's a pretty good crust on everything.  So I was more thinking of the ice in the water tanks.  Oh, yeah, we have one tank we have to cut every day.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:26):**  And where the cows are, even though we have a, they call it the freeze miser.  You've ever heard of that where they?  Yes.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:34):**  Dry.  It opens when it gets below at 34 or something.  So that thing's running in that one, but you still got to cut the top open.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:42):**  At last year when it was so cold for so long.  It got to the point like, I put my cows down on the creek, specifically because I knew  it was going to be, you know, we saw the weather coming.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:13:54):**  Like I'll put them down on the creek, there should be good, you know, my school season  grass down there left plenty range for him to run around.  It's like 100 and 147 acres of creek bottom.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:05):**  Okay, plenty places for him to hide.  And for some reason, I just for the first 10 days of that cold, I decided that I just  absolutely had to keep that tank open for them because they had to take water and they  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:19):**  had the creek.  And I should have realized that I should have looked at the tracks and understood that they  weren't coming up to the tank.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:28):**  They're going out twice a day to try to get, you know, eight, nine inches of ice out of  the stupid thing and keep the float clear so it could work.  I gave up.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:37):**  I just gave up.  I went down, I went down, I looked at the creek and I'm like, you know, it was like  nine degrees that morning.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:45):**  And the sun wasn't out.  And I went down and looked at the creek and oh, that's where they're drinking.  That's where all the what that's where all the tracks are.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:14:51):**  Maybe I'll just give up on this tank project and save that half hour of backbreaking labor  twice a day.  Yeah, yeah, ours didn't get too bad because we do it every day.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:15:02):**  But around this particular tank is a pretty good pile of the pile of ice.  So the cows I put out some bedding out there.  So they got traction, but they kind of have to walk up almost a ramp to get to it right  
**[0:15:14-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:15:14):**  now.  But I find that they tend to not come up to it as much I think they're eating more snow  or something because you watch them, they don't come up.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:15:27):**  And right now we're, you know, we've changed a lot what we've done in the last few years,  we're trying to get away from breeding stock.  So we are hurt, we're really just as bare minimum as we need right now.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:15:37):**  We'll start buying feeders in here starting end of this month.  For our grass program, we got three different places that we buy from.  So that are, they don't want to do the marketing.  
**[0:15:48-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:15:48):**  So we buy animals and then finish them on grass and market them.  So but the cow calf even with what we do, it's because we have to feed typically so  many months, the cow calf just doesn't have the profitability compared to buying in the  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:16:06):**  young stock.  So.  And that's understandable.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:16:10):**  And I've been, I guess that's been kind of a subject a lot lately that I've been discussing  not on this platform, but you know, with some other folks is, and we'll probably get into  this shortly because you just got back from ranching for profit.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:16:30):**  And I'll put the ding in later.  You just got back from the school that shall not be named and I don't want to talk negatively  about it or give anybody a negative impression, but it seems that the tools that you get at  
**[0:16:46-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:16:46):**  the school and the way they encourage you to look at your economics and your finances  and your business structure, it pushes a lot of guys towards the custom grazing on leased  land model or custom grazing on owned land model is starting to push a lot of guys, you  
**[0:17:02-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:17:02):**  know, kind of away from the cow calf, which I can understand, but there's a certain point  where the economics of that cow calf business are going to flip.  And what I mean by that is the small frame forage-based maternal genetics that we need  
**[0:17:28-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:17:28):**  to get back in our cow herd that we've bred out of them by using high energy feed and  feed lots and whatnot.  If we can get back to those kinds of cows, I think we can get some profitability back  
**[0:17:38-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:17:38):**  in the cow calf sector and not take anything away from what anybody else is doing.  Oh, absolutely.  I think you probably, well, you know, when you've been there, the question always, well,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:17:50):**  what happens if nobody does cows anymore?  Which of course isn't going to happen, but.  Right.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:17:57):**  You know, so talking numbers, the average cow size, average cow herd size in the US  is like 44 cows, I think.  And that's fair.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:18:11):**  That's actually not a whole lot less than what I personally own.  I can run a lot more than that on the ranch.  But we've got a lot of, I guess, I hate to use this term because I'm sure a bunch of  
**[0:18:26-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:18:26):**  them listen to this podcast and I don't want to use this term disparagingly, but backyard  breeders guys with three or five, and they're not going to be as concerned with, with how  that animal performs in a real world.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:18:44):**  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  Cause they don't have, I mean, they're not going to retain their females either probably.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:18:51):**  So more likely than not.  There's always going to be a need for guys that are retaining females and raising heifers,  especially in a forage based system.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:01):**  I guess that's my point.  And yeah, the economics of it might not necessarily look the rosiest, but I think it's a long-term  investment.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:11):**  I think it's a long-term project.  Well, as long as it's profitable, maybe it's a different percentage of profit, but yeah,  you do need them.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:21):**  And it even, you know, we're still keeping some breeding cows.  We made the mistake.  We've got a couple that are, you know, you can pet and we get people to come out and  
**[0:19:30-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:30):**  tour a lot.  So it's wonderful to have a, you know, a cow that you can come up and give her a scratch.  We have one color red cow.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:39):**  She's just a good cow.  She's open, but she's going to get another chance.  And yeah, by the, by the rules, she should go away.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:19:51):**  But from that standpoint, she's worth keeping around.  And if we, our deal is we're, we're on a lot of real degraded ground that was row cropped  for years and years and years.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:20:02):**  And we've been asked to come in and put the fences in when we get to a point, which I  think we can, where we're able to have enough stock pound forage where we're only feeding,  Hey, let's say 60 days.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:20:16):**  I can run the economics and make it work, especially if we want to start getting, you  know, the genetics in our area away from this feedlot type so that they do perform on our  forage.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:20:28):**  Somebody's going to have to do that.  So if we can get it to that point, then I can see it being economic, profitable, I guess,  to do cow calf.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:20:42):**  And we would go there.  We love cow calf.  We're like everybody else.  
**[0:20:45-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:20:45):**  We're actually working right now and bringing sheep back in as a breeding, doing a breeding  flock because the numbers are different on that right now we buy a lot of feeder lambs.  Well boy, that gets pretty tight buying feeder lambs right now and even in selling them into  
**[0:21:03-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:21:03):**  the markets that we sell them to.  So we're going to do a breeding flock on the sheep side of things, and more of a stock  for situation on the cattle side of things until we can get that stockpile and we get  
**[0:21:15-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:21:15):**  this, a lot of our soils are really degraded, you know, and we're pretty sandy where we're  all the stuff that we run is pretty sandy.  So once you get to that point, I can see doing cow calf again, for sure.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:21:32):**  How are sheep in your environment as a soil rehabilitation tool versus cattle?  Well because they eat the different forages, they can be handy that way.  Impact wise, it's obviously less.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:21:49):**  You know, they're a little bit harder to manage.  I think that's why a lot of people stay away from it, but we've been able to train ours  to single line eventually.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:21:57):**  How'd you do that?  What's that?  How'd you do that?  
**[0:22:02-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:02):**  Well, you always start them in a netting, you know, and then you put a line inside that's  hot.  And you, well, two lines actually, we do a two line and we pull the netting away eventually.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:14):**  And then they're on two poly lines.  And then you kind of keep an eye on them after a while, we're able to move it and move off  that one and just do it a single line.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:25):**  And we didn't trust that.  And my wife and I were out moving sheep one day, and I thought, well, I'll just take two  O'Brien posts and put that wire down on the ground.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:36):**  And they'll just run right over it into the next paddock.  No, no way.  Now they hit that line, even though it wasn't even visible.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:45):**  And they all just piled into a stop like a freight train.  And we kept trying, I thought, well, this isn't gonna work.  So we had to reel the line up.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:22:53):**  Then we realized that one line will keep them in and we haven't had an issue since so it's  it's worked out pretty good.  That way.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:03):**  Go ahead.  Sorry.  That's really interesting that you put the fence down on the ground and the sheep still  
**[0:23:08-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:08):**  wouldn't cross it because I'm sure there's a lot of sheep guys that just listen to that  that are going, no way, no way mine would go through there like water through a pipe.  Yeah, no, we didn't.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:22):**  We can move them with a line.  We just we just haven't had an issue with it.  I would assume if they were pushed really hard by a predator, maybe they would but I  
**[0:23:31-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:31):**  mean, we were pushing them on foot and they wouldn't wouldn't go over that line even though  it was on the ground.  So I mean, I can I can see how it works.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:42):**  It's just kind of a long term psychology issues like the wrecking the recognize they recognize  the net fence as a barrier.  When they know it's a barrier, they know when they go touch it, they're going to get shocked.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:23:55):**  And then when you step inside of that, with your single or your double poly, you know,  I assume a foot or two.  Yeah, it's about 11 inches, 12 inches off the ground.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:24:06):**  So I forget what hook it is on the O'Brien posts.  It's like the fourth one up or something like that.  That's my measure.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:24:13):**  As you know, and I'm sure that they test it as as part of the learning process to go under  your single poly, get shocked by it and then get into the net and get another shock.  And like anything else, they'll learn that.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:24:27):**  With cows, I think it's a much quicker training process or we've just bred in, you know, we've  bred, we've been running electric fence around cows long enough that they all kind of genetically  now understand what what a hot wire is.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:24:42):**  Do you see any of that with the sheep?  We don't because they're feeders, we don't keep them long enough.  That'll be so with the cattle, another reason to keep back some older cows or some cows  
**[0:24:54-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:24:54):**  that are used to the whole program, because now when you're bringing feeders in through  the summer, because you know, you might bring it bring a group of 20.  And I found that if you've got those animals in there that know that fence, yeah, we hardly  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:08):**  have them.  So how's it going?  Sorry, I'm late.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:11):**  I totally just didn't get my times right.  So that's on me.  I apologize.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:16):**  But that mountain time thing?  Yes.  I was like, I thought one he's like, yes, central.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:21):**  It's like, okay, I've got it right now.  You're outside chopping wood.  I'm glad you're doing something useful.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:30):**  Can you see where Joel shopping wood from your office?  I know he because he's on 40.  But yeah.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:36):**  I had to run run across the field.  So you guys are welcome.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:44):**  So one thing I did I go ahead, go ahead.  Sorry.  I say I did I retired from chewing horses about two years ago now almost two January's  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:25:55):**  ago.  And that's a whole other story.  But I did find that after I did that, I got to be careful what I eat because when I was  
**[0:26:02-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:26:02):**  shooting horses full time, I could eat whatever I wanted whenever I want it.  So yeah, like 5000 calories a day.  And now it's kind of well, I shouldn't have that extra ice cream today.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:26:14):**  Yeah, fair years hard work and literally, and I don't want anybody to be confused, or  think that anybody can hang iron on a hoof.  That's not that's not that skill.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:26:30):**  But being able to heat up iron shape a hoof to correct a problem on the horse's foot.  That's when you need to call a farrier and the two skills are dramatically different.  I was jumped because, you know, I did a lot of horses in that, you know, for a shirt for  
**[0:26:47-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:26:47):**  the eventers and jumpers and all this.  So you'd have a dad, and he's got a daughter and you know, wants a horse, well, they end  up with two horses, because you got to have their companion, you know, herd animals, you  
**[0:26:58-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:26:58):**  got to have a body.  So they've been convinced to buy two horses, they got the trailer and the truck or the  SUV or whatever to pull it.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:07):**  And the vet was out there.  And I did a lot of work with vets, a lot of founder work and stuff like that.  So the vets would go out and do other stuff.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:14):**  And then they said, Well, you're gonna need the farrier out here.  So by the time I get out there, they give me a call.  If they spent all this money on these two horses, and I show up, and I trim these two  
**[0:27:25-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:25):**  horses in just like right now, I don't, boom, I mean, they're not there in a half an hour.  And the guy I give him a bill and dad thinks he's already dropped how much on all these  horses.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:36):**  He goes, wow, that didn't look real hard.  So I thought I'd give him some tools and I'd show him on a trim horses never once did I  lose a customer that way.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:45):**  Oh, yeah, once they never realized that, you know, I do this every day, six days a week.  You know, and I still do my wife's horse.  And we're looking at getting another one and some neighbors here.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:27:57):**  But being that I don't do it every day, I it I feel it now.  You know, we were, it is it is extremely physically demanding.  You don't see very many old farriers that that don't complain about how bad their back  
**[0:28:14-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:28:14):**  and knees hurt all the time.  And that's kind of well, I got out of it.  I was, I was at the heights, you know, I was doing well, it's a very good way to make a  
**[0:28:23-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:28:23):**  living.  It's, it's honest, it's lucrative, it's, I like the art of it.  But when I moved, and I was gonna have to change my clientele, I was still driving back  
**[0:28:35-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:28:35):**  every few weeks and getting under 30 some had a weekend if I could, to try to keep my  clientele.  And finally, I said, you know what, I'm going to just start building my business over here.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:28:46):**  My wife goes, do you want to do that?  You know, I was turning 40, which isn't that old.  But when you're shooting horses, do I want to build a whole new book of business?  
**[0:28:58-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:28:58):**  Do this till I'm 60 plus years old.  It's not always the end is the miles.  It's the Yeah, you it was I was I found myself getting tapped, kicked.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:29:12):**  I wasn't moving as fast as I used to when I was in my 30s and my 20s.  And I thought, you know what, one of these days, I'm not going to move fast enough, and  it's not going to be my elbow or my shoulder, my hip, it's going to be my head.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:29:24):**  On this grass, you know, direct marketing meat thing is going pretty good.  Maybe I should think about not chewing horses.  I would also say that, like having the skill having, having the skills to be able to horseshoe  
**[0:29:43-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:29:43):**  and farrier when you have two teams, that's probably pretty, that's probably a pretty  important cost saving skill to have.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:29:55):**  And the teams, you know, they'd pick their feet up, put them on a stand, you know, and  they were always really good about, but it was work.  I mean, it was, you know, that's big feet.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:06):**  You figure, you figure the size of a saddle horse, even a nice ranch horse compared to  a Belgian, like a beer candle coffee can.  Yeah, like a dinner plate.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:18):**  Yeah, it's, it's a different deal.  But no, it's one of those things.  I'm glad I did it for all the years.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:25):**  I did it for about 26 years.  So it was, it was a good, good run.  So, Hey, you're ready to talk about your trip to Minot?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:35):**  Oh, absolutely.  So the school that may not be named.  Now you're saying Dallas, why do we go to Minot in February?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:47):**  I thought the answer was, is because John got to go to Phoenix in January.  But I did hear that.  I know that's why John got stuck having to go to Minot.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:30:59):**  We're talking about John Locke, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:03):**  Yeah.  Houston boy in a Minot in February.  He probably didn't leave the hotel either.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:09):**  Did he?  Oh, no, not until the last night we all left, but it was funny to walk out the last day.  I was looking at other people.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:18):**  Have you, have you left the hotel?  We've got there on Sunday at what?  1230.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:24):**  I did not go outside the walls of that building until that Friday at about seven.  I have never been inside a building my entire life for that long.  You never had to leave.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:38):**  It's just so intense that you don't, you don't even really realize it.  You don't think about it.  No, it goes fast.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:43):**  It went really fast, but I, John was just an excellent instructor.  I mean, I have learned a lot.  It was fun because we could razzle about his floppy herd cattle.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:31:55):**  That was a good time.  So he takes it well.  He does.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:00):**  Yeah.  For the most part.  So without sounding like a sales pitch, tell us, tell us about your experience at ranching  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:09):**  for profit over the days and, and what are some of the tools that you've learned and  how are you applying them?  For me going.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:17):**  So I, I'm a podcast nerd, a junkie, whatever you want to call it.  You know, I listened to a lot of stuff.  I obviously listen to your podcast and the others out there and a lot of business stuff.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:31):**  I read, I've read everything of Dave Pratt that I absolutely can, you know, so I went  in with a pretty high expectation.  Like I am going to get my breakthrough.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:42):**  What's my I'm going in with my breakthrough.  And for me, it was a lot of what we've learned and gone and just dug a little deeper into  that part of it.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:32:54):**  For me, it's the finance part of it.  How do we take all these entities that they ever run in?  Cause they want them to split them down instead of just having the meat side of things, you  
**[0:33:03-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:33:03):**  know, we need to get it down to the beef, the pork, the lamb, the chicken, the turkeys,  the marketing side, actually Walker farms is.  One of the things that has come away from that is that's probably going to become a  
**[0:33:16-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:33:16):**  brand that we sell to, which was like kind of an eye-opener it's, it's struggling that  structuring, I guess for me, walking away with that type of structure was very helpful,  very helpful.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:33:33):**  And I think the reason that being able to pull back a little bit and, and see how something  should be structured, lets you start putting those costs where they should be.  You were just talking about, you know, having selling to the beef business and having things  
**[0:33:49-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:33:49):**  broke out, you know, beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and the birds.  You don't know where your money's going unless you have those things broken out.  Like you might just have a feed bill.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:33:59):**  Okay, great.  You know how much you spend on feed.  If you just have cows, you know how much you spend on feed for cows, but if all that's  
**[0:34:06-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:34:06):**  lumped in, you got to have those things separate.  I'm not saying you didn't, but I'm just, just making the point.  No, it's, that's absolutely it.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:34:14):**  And it did bring in, you know, we've with our egg laying, for instance, we'll use that  one high labor eggs are high labor.  They can be very highly profitable.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:34:24):**  I know seven sons there, they said that's one of the most profitable things they do.  For us, it wasn't.  And we actually have a friend, he was doing raw milk.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:34:35):**  He's retired from that older gentleman, has a nice flock of pasture birds.  I mean, he must have thousand birds.  Well, he was kind of backing off and wanted to sell us eggs.  
**[0:34:47-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:34:47):**  Well, he raises eggs on the same protocol as we use pasture, non GMO, the whole nine  yards.  So we've actually switched over to buying our eggs in flats from him.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:02):**  We still run them through our cleaner, you know, our washer and all that stuff.  But we just get them by the flat rather than having that labor here.  So the only thing I'm a little nervous with it, because we just started doing that out  
**[0:35:15-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:15):**  for the last few months, is I do like what the birds do on the pasture.  Yeah, I'm the cows.  It's it's amazing.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:24):**  So we're going to see how that works.  We still might have to run some, mainly just for that cleanup.  You know, do you guys have neighbors or anything?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:33):**  Like are you guys out in the boondocks?  We have neighbors now.  We're pretty if you look on Google Earth, I mean, we got trees around everything.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:40):**  We're like, I wonder if you can lease that business to someone.  Wonder if that's.  Yep.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:46):**  We'd like to find a very ambitious young person.  We've got it.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:51):**  On our we do our own butchering for poultry.  And it's hard to find labor.  We have a really good crew.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:35:57):**  And I got a pretty good story on that last night.  But most of them have a career somewhere else.  But they come we butcher usually every other week in the summertime to three weeks, depending  
**[0:36:09-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:36:09):**  we do a little over 2000 birds a year in our own facility.  Plus, we send some up to an inspected facility.  With our facility, we have to sell to the end user.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:36:20):**  So our customers, we can't take them to like a food co-op or restaurant.  Yeah, just our poultry.  So we do do some that can go that route.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:36:29):**  But we have a young young man that's come and help us.  It's the son, or one of our friends that comes but he's getting his driver's license.  And I found out that this is a big motivator for young men, at least and probably young  
**[0:36:43-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:36:43):**  women as well.  But they get that driver's license and they need fuel money and date money.  So they come and work and work hard.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:36:55):**  Imagine that.  I was actually kind of shocked.  Our daughters in her second semester at college.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:37:06):**  And I taught her to drive on the back roads.  I mean, she's had a driver's license for three years.  She got it.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:37:14):**  We got a farm permit, I think when she was, I think we got it when she was 14.  And I taught her to drive.  And the number like the percentage of kids in her generation that she's in college with  
**[0:37:29-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:37:29):**  that do not have a driver's license is seriously.  Yeah, yeah, it's high.  That surprises me that they don't even have that.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:37:38):**  And it's mostly it's mostly the kids.  The I shouldn't say kids.  It's mostly the adults that are coming from, you know, big areas, Kansas City, city, Chicago,  
**[0:37:51-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:37:51):**  New York City, East Coast, where there's some public transportation or they live in a city  where there's Ubers around or their parents have always been a ride or they can just Uber  somewhere.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:02):**  Yeah, no, I don't.  Yeah, I had friends that didn't get even here that didn't get their driver's license.  So they were 18.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:09):**  I mean, that what we were driving when we could reach the pedals and barely then and  you can get we can get a farmer's permit at 15.  So I had a driver's license at 15.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:20):**  You know, I had my CDL at 18.  You know, and all that kind of fun stuff.  But I don't.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:27):**  I don't know.  Yeah, there's less and less of kids being excited to go out and do that.  That's so interesting.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:35):**  I feel like I would be like, No, I don't want to be restricted.  Like if I need to have that ability.  Yeah, I think I was like 10 when my dad taught me how to drive.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:48):**  Yeah, right on a ranch.  That's very practical skill to have.  Hey, getting this pickup and pull the trailer to the other side of the pasture.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah, hey, Dad, I can do that.  You know, it's it can be a big it can be a huge time and labor saver just to have somebody  around to move a vehicle.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:06):**  Yeah.  That makes me think like, is, is this generation gonna they're just depending on society for  everything then?  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:16):**  Like, that's just another thing that they're not they're relying on others to provide a  service for them.  That's kind of crazy.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:23):**  Yeah, who knows?  But we're going back to the ranching for that.  Yeah, profit thing that the butchering side of things too.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:32):**  That's another one.  You know, we're gonna sit down and really look at that one.  Is that one that we want to keep doing?  
**[0:39:41-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:41):**  Does it make sense?  You're talking about doing your own birds during the butchering?  And that comes down to labor and then just, you know, facilities we have a nice you know,  
**[0:39:52-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:39:52):**  we have an automatic scalder, plucker, we have really nice facility.  It's Joel Salatin style.  I mean, it's open air type of deal.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:40:03):**  So you wonder is there there's some folks around here, there's one guy that does a mobile  and it's actually mobile processing poultry and it's inspected.  We're strongly looking at thinking was that does it make sense to keep doing this?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:40:18):**  Or should our time be you're you question?  That's what I find myself now I'm going around, I'm questioning everything I'm doing is that  is this  
**[0:40:27-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:40:27):**  They don't give you any answers.  They just make you come home and ask all more questions.  Yeah, would I do this for $15 an hour?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:40:38):**  So all those kinds of things and bringing it back.  My brother has not gone yet.  He's going to go at some point, but it's bringing it home and then trying to  
**[0:40:50-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:40:50):**  teach it to the rest of our team, you know, because we got my, my folks  who after they sold out the farm bag about two, they were teaching, well, they want to  retire from that and come back to the farm.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:41:06):**  And so they're an integral part of what we do.  So we got to get them on board and now here here, you know, Annalise and I come back with  all these ideas, you know, this big flip chart thing, and we're going to do all this stuff.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:41:19):**  And we have to get our, our ducks in a row before we bring this to the rest of the team.  My mom's reading Dave Pratt's book, the healthy families or the, you know, which one I'm talking  about.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:41:33):**  It escapes me to kind of help get on board with some of the thought processes and where  we're trying to go.  We're not trying to say that we don't need to do stuff or we're trying to get rid of  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:41:43):**  something.  We said, we just need to look at it really hard.  You know, how do we make it work?  
**[0:41:50-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:41:50):**  Cause we know with one of our issues and I would, if we want to go into the, the direct  to consumer thing, direct to consumer sounds, you know, I've been doing it.  So I read, oh, it was 20 years ago.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:02):**  Now I read omnivores dilemma was introduced to Joe South.  And I mean, I hooked line and sinker.  I just went right into that.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:12):**  I went right to direct to consumer did it, had a good business doing that.  Went to CSA model, which, and, and on the rail hanging weight sales.  The thing is, is people need to realize that that is a very high labor intense here.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:32):**  Here's the reality on our farm.  I don't do a ton of that part of it.  My wife does.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:40):**  And she, she does our marketing.  She does our inventory.  She does a lot of the packing.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:49):**  We, we deliver door to door every Thursday.  We do different routes, you know, in the twin cities once a month, we have one route we  do twice a month.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:42:58):**  And then another, we go another direction once a month and she gets that all set up.  Well, when it's harvest season and my brother and I are gone, you know, we do, we custom  harvest between small grains and coarse grains about 2000 acres a year.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:43:14):**  That takes us a couple of days.  This year was a little better because the weather was nice, but you know, we're gone.  If you got good weather, well, then it's, then she's a one woman band, you know, it's  
**[0:43:27-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:43:27):**  a, it's something that I think you got to think about if you're going to do that.  The labor, it's not just magic.  You know, you make all this profit, you know, I hear, I hear people, we go and talk and  
**[0:43:41-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:43:41):**  have tours and people think, Oh yeah, you know, it's really easy.  You just, you know, get a website and all this way.  She spends hours a week, hours and hours, making sure that the social media is up to  
**[0:43:53-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:43:53):**  date.  And I'm not a big tech guy.  I'll go, if she says, I need you to go videotape X, Y, or Z, you know, go, go look at calves  
**[0:44:02-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:02):**  or go look at piglets and talk about it.  Okay.  I'll take my phone out and do the, you know, introduce myself kind of deal, but I don't  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:10):**  do the editing, any of that.  It's it's a big chore.  Editing is work.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:18):**  Don't let anybody lie to you and say that's not editing is work.  We were talking about it this morning at breakfast.  So I said, I don't know how some of these folks who watch the YouTube, you know, guys  
**[0:44:31-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:31):**  and think now that I know what's involved with that, you think, well, they put that  10 minute video up on there.  Well, they got hours into that to make it look nice, you know?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:43):**  So I have a lot, I think that do spend hours and hours on 15 minute video.  And I think there's some people that it just kind of comes natural to, and they can bust  out, you know, a 20 minute video in an hour.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:44:59):**  That's nice and professional.  I'm not that guy.  Yeah, that wouldn't be me either.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:04):**  No.  So, but the direct to consumer, I know it because you're talking about a lot, you know,  shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:12):**  I think that's, that's great.  You know, our big thing for our farm is get to know your farmer or know your farmer.  You say that that's kind of our sign off deal, know your farmer.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:22):**  And it's, that's a good deal.  And I, I think we would need a lot more of it.  You know, I'm on board with Mike, you know, Mike Calcrate on that kind of deal.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:31):**  But it's not, the question is how do you scale that?  And our, our big thing going to the RFP is turnover on that side of our business is difficult  because you've got, we use two different processors and with the, the, all the fun stuff that's  
**[0:45:51-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:51):**  been going on for the last two years.  Yes, it's been great for our business because more and more people want, especially because  we were doing door to door delivery.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:45:59):**  They want that, especially when everything closed down, we were already doing it, but  now you still got to get the butcher slots.  And then you've got, it's a whole nother management.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:09):**  It's not like you go, well, I've got, you know, a hundred calves ready to go.  I'm just going to run down to the sales barn and unload my trucks and they'll send me a  check.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:19):**  And no, you have to have, you know, we lock in our animals before we were locking them  in almost a year in advance.  Now they've switched it.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:27):**  So we're on a six month.  So my brother on the first of every month is booking our animals for six months down  the road to make sure, and then we have to decide, well, how many do we want?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:38):**  You know, okay.  If it's going to be October, November, that's, you know, a lot of, a lot of our hanging weight  stuff goes in at that time.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:46):**  So it's, you know, 20 animals or whatever it is.  And then we do it once a month processing at our main butcher.  And so we'll bring in so many hogs and so many beef every month, but how many do you  
**[0:46:59-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:46:59):**  need, you know, and then what quality, because sometimes when I shouldn't say quality, but  what age.  So, you know, with the whole 30 month deal, are we doing hamburger animals and we want  
**[0:47:09-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:47:09):**  boneless cuts.  So we might take a three-year-old cow or something.  And I, I'll be the first to tell you, I'm going to have a ribeye.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:47:17):**  I want an older animal.  I personally, I think they taste way better, but if you're going to do a hanging animal  to sell to a customer as a half a beef, well, we got to have a prime steer or heifer, you  
**[0:47:30-0:47:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:47:30):**  know, because they're wanting T-bones and, you know, bone-in rib and bone-in cuts.  So you have to think, okay, it's just a lot of management that it's, I don't know if that  gets talked about enough because I've the extra work.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:47:50):**  It's not just magic.  You get, you know, $9 a pound for your beef or something like that, you know?  Right.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:47:56):**  So why do you like a ribeye from an old cow better than you like one from, from the let's  just say finished animal?  I found that we're talking about an old grass cow, right?  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:09):**  Grass.  Yep.  Grass cow.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:12):**  Right.  That's what you mean?  Yeah, probably.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:15):**  We had a three-year-old cow that went in that we took a half for just our personal use and  the ribeyes, you know, we had to be careful because we almost ate those things all the  way up.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:26):**  You know, we were having ribeye every week because they're so good.  I mean, they just, and that's a flavor that I appreciate something.  We eat a lot of wild game too.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:34):**  My wife grew up in Virginia, Minnesota, which is up on the iron range and her family's big  into hunting.  So they were, you know, bear and venison and a lot of wild game.  
**[0:48:47-0:49:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:48:47):**  She loves that wild game.  And so we like that and lamb, you know, we love like leg of lamb.  I mean, I'd eat that every day, but it's kind of pricey, even if you buy it from yourself.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:49:02):**  So I appreciate that flavor, that depth of flavor of the aged animal.  That's and that's a personal.  The only ones who don't really eat beef fat or protein that way with the depth of flavor,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:49:14):**  like you're talking about, like that's very much common with South American, how Europeans  eat their meat.  So that's just something that we, we lost in our culture.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:49:24):**  Yeah.  Well, my parents, they did a deal over in Qatar for two years.  They were teaching and yeah, my dad said you could go into the store over there and you  
**[0:49:35-0:49:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:49:35):**  could get lamb from anywhere in the world.  You know, they had us lamb, Australian lamb, Egyptian lamb, you know, New Zealand lamb,  but he said the, the difference in the flavors were, it was noticeable.  
**[0:49:52-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:49:52):**  And another thing my dad always says though, it's with what we do is you don't realize  people don't realize what good food is because they don't have it, but once they've had it,  you know, but yeah, it's a personal preference.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:50:07):**  I think going back to the aged cow, I mean, I, I much prefer that.  So I was, I was on another social media platform yesterday and with a couple other guys that  are, that are fairly like-minded and we got to some, but one of the fans asked the question  
**[0:50:31-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:50:31):**  about NHTC cattle, non-hormone treated.  And so we kind of started talking about that.  And one of the guys was unfamiliar with, you know, why cattle get implanted.  
**[0:50:45-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:50:45):**  And without naming any names, I went to a ranch that I visited last year, had a bunch  of stalker steers on it.  Like let's just call them 500 stalker steers.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:51:00):**  And they were owned, I think by a feedlot, you know, that bottom is, bottom is calves,  send them to a background or the new, send them to grass for a few months.  And then they're going to the feedlot to do what they do.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:51:10):**  All these cattle had been implanted with, with some growth hormone.  I don't know which one it was specifically.  And some of the conversation that, you know, for the couple of days that I was there, we  
**[0:51:23-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:51:23):**  were talking about implants and what they do.  And basically what it is, is it's a time release capsule that they put into the animal that  releases estrogen.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:51:34):**  Now I'm not a real smart guy, but when you put female sex hormones into a male animal,  it messes with them.  It messes with their emotional response and how they act.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:51:51):**  In this particular case, the female hormones in about 1% of the animals was so strong that  each one of those had 10 to 15 other steers, chasing around, trying to ride them.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:52:07):**  There might've been some in there that gained on top of four or five pounds a day, just  absolutely did ridiculous because of the implants.  But then you've got that 10% of the animals that chasing around a few, trying to ride  
**[0:52:19-0:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:52:19):**  them all the time, that can't be good.  And then we got into talking about the difference in between hormones.  So testosterone has a tendency to build more chiseled, more chiseled, stacked muscle, right?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:52:36):**  Estrogen builds softer, curvier muscle.  I think we can agree with that without offending anybody.  So I just wanted to bring that, I just wanted to get that out there in the light in the  
**[0:52:52-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:52:52):**  world that maybe this is something we really need to look at is how we're messing up these  cattle with all these hormones.  I don't support it at all.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:02):**  That's pretty obvious from listening to me or listening to any of this podcast that I  don't think that's natural.  Well, and the question again, then it goes back to whether it's, no, it's not natural.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:14):**  Then what does it actually cost to do there?  Is there actually a gain?  It's what do they say all the time?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:20):**  It's not just the cost of the inputs.  It's the cost of the inputting.  Somebody's got to do that.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:25):**  So what does that all pencil out to be?  And then just like you said, with these hormones, okay, we could argue that one all day long,  but I also know a lot of people now that I was unfamiliar with, they spayed the heifers.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:40):**  It's not very common here where I'm at.  You hardly ever hear about that, but I'm finding out West that a lot of people spay, feeder  heifers to keep them from riding.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:53:51):**  And I have a friend who did it and he said, yeah, it was like eight bucks a head.  And when he said that and he's doing what 700 and some head at the time, I just about  fell over when I thought about labor and everything that he in the end said it was worth it.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:54:07):**  So now you put an implant in them so that you have that issue or are we taking the estrogen  away?  You know what I mean?  
**[0:54:19-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:54:19):**  There's totally different, there can be programs, polar opposites of the common sense spectrum.  And you could put those two guys in a room and they'll both agree what the other one  is doing is right.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:54:30):**  Yeah.  But I don't know what to see because we have an opportunity we got, talk about we could  rabbit hole we have right next to us, we have the Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:54:43):**  It's about 36,000 acres of National Wildlife Refuge.  And a friend of mine was managing cattle out there.  It was on a custom grazing contract.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:54:57):**  He didn't own them.  And that had its pros and cons.  We're looking this year, he wants to put a more owned herd together.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:05):**  So we're looking at buying animals to put into that to graze out there, you know, in  an all natural trying to figure out what class animal we want to put out there.  And see what we can do on that native what we would consider native around here, as native  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:21):**  as you're going to find.  But yeah, trying to figure that animal out.  Would that just be cows?  
**[0:55:29-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:29):**  Or would that be some kind of multi species situation?  I think eventually they want to do it where they had sheep and cattle, right.  I think the management of the sheep on the refuge would be you'd have to have guardian  
**[0:55:42-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:42):**  dogs.  And because it's, it's definitely not a lot of coyotes.  We don't have wolves around here so much people say we do.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:50):**  Maybe we do.  Maybe we don't.  But it's a lot of coyotes though.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:55:53):**  And we've had that issue with our birds before, especially our laying flocks.  So that would be the issue with sheep.  With the cattle last year, they had cow calf out there.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:56:02):**  And the problem with that was when they would move them.  The calves, you know, have bed down somewhere on the middle of the night or whatever all  the calves and the cows want to get back together.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:56:12):**  And how we got involved with it is this friend of mine called he, the sheriff's out there,  they got a calf on the wrong side of the road.  Could you run over there and help?  
**[0:56:25-0:56:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:56:25):**  You know, do this.  So this year, we want to not have cow calf, we want to have stalkers or maybe cows we're  looking at potentially just buying, you know, under condition cows, put some condition on  
**[0:56:41-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:56:41):**  them.  There it goes back.  So at the beginning of December, I went down to Doug Ferguson's sell by class.  
**[0:56:49-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:56:49):**  Okay, so it's like trying to figure out how you use that knowledge to buy the appropriate  class of cattle to put out there.  So  
**[0:57:00-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:00):**  Rook, I didn't know you'd been to that sell by school.  Have you been to Uncle Wally's sell by school yet?  Have you heard of it?  
**[0:57:09-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:09):**  No, I haven't.  I went to Doug's because it was just worked better in my schedule.  I actually went down there with Jared Lumen, who does the Herdquitter podcast.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:19):**  He lives about three hours from me in southern Minnesota.  Spoiler alert, Jared and I have one on the schedule to do together.  That's awesome.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:26):**  So Jared is just he's just a good guy.  Actually.  He was supposed to go to the RFP in Minot with us.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:36):**  And he got sick, but his dad came.  Oh, really?  John Lumen.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:40):**  Yeah.  And he's obviously they raise bulls for feral and just a lot of knowledge.  You know, he's been around the world looking at different grazing stuff.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:57:50):**  And I did John is raised bulls for Pharaoh.  Oh, yeah, yeah, no, they raise if we if we were to get back into breeding stock and looked  at if we were looking for grass genetics, I would strongly look at bulls that came from  
**[0:58:05-0:58:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:05):**  his farm just because they're in our environment already.  And they had that herdsman up here for a long time.  And that's the important note.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:13):**  A herd that's been in the area for a while and has proven genetics to perform in that  area.  And then there's also an asterisk like bull salesman or salesman.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:26):**  Not saying any more about that.  If you're if you're going to buy a bull from a guy that won't let you go to his pastures  or won't let you kind of come drop in unannounced and see how he's taking care of those bulls.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:38):**  Do you really want that?  Do you really trust what he's what he's trying to sell you?  Yeah, oh, absolutely.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:45):**  And by no means is that a call out on anybody?  That's just a general observation about about the cattle business.  Yeah, no, you got to know where those the genetics especially when you're going to try  
**[0:58:54-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:58:54):**  doing this grass finishing on, you know, a lot of the stuff we're getting in isn't necessarily  grass genetics.  But we're able to make that work.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:59:06):**  Because in our area when we have grass, we have good grass because it's a short period  of time, you know, it's pretty high octane stuff.  We have moderate rain where we're at.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:59:16):**  We're pretty technically I think we're at 32 inches or whatever.  And last year was definitely not that.  But I used to actually started out with black Galloways when I was in Wisconsin.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:59:30):**  The problem with the black Galloway, beautiful animals, they winter really well, they gain  in the winter.  But you are pushing 24 months to try to finish one of those.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:59:44):**  And that's pushing it.  You know, you got to have months of pretty good stuff, you know, good pasture to do that.  So a friend of mine that over in Wisconsin, he's retired now, but he started bringing  
**[0:59:55-1:00:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=0:59:55):**  in some Angus bulls, and more old fashioned kind of Angus bulls and then crossing them  on to those black Galloways.  And those F1s, those were some nice cattle for our area, because they have the coat to  
**[1:00:12-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:12):**  hold you through the winter.  But to have that little bit of Angus in there, we could finish them in about 18 to 20 months  and have a quality finish.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:23):**  I mean, a true finish.  I think a lot of people don't understand that too, when you do a cut.  I mean, if you look on your plate, you can tell if that animal was, if you're looking  
**[1:00:30-1:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:30):**  at a steak, finished or not.  And we tend to under finish animals in the grass fed world, I think.  So why is that?  
**[1:00:42-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:42):**  Well part of it is processing time.  I mean, I know we've shipped some animals this year that I was nervous that they weren't  quite there.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:50):**  But you have that processing date.  When you have the six months, right?  You have to that's your end goal, right?  
**[1:00:56-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:00:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're looking at all that and you go, well, I've got my slots, I need to fill them.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:04):**  And you don't have to back out too many times on a butcher and they're going to go, well,  maybe this isn't worth my time.  Because they take your slot reservation.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:12):**  Yeah, it's these guys are still really busy around here.  So you're, we're trying to make sure they're finished.  You know, we're looking at tail head, we're looking at the fill on the animals just to,  
**[1:01:25-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:25):**  you know, make sure that they're finished the best we can.  And more often than not, they are.  But every once in a while, you send one down, you go, well, it'll be close.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:36):**  And our customers, we've never had complaints about it.  And maybe it's because I would be more picky.  You know, I don't know.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:46):**  You have a high quality standard, you mean?  We do when it comes to that.  I mean, because you there again with the direct to consumer.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:01:53):**  You want them to come back, right?  You want them to come back, you want to say good things.  And with social media nowadays, it doesn't take it takes one bad apple and most people,  
**[1:02:02-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:02):**  it's not with the beef and lamb and stuff.  We don't usually have issues chicken.  You know, every once in a while you get a chicken that has a wing that's bad.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:13):**  Now we cut up 90 plus percent of what goes through our facility here because the boneless,  skinless breasts, stuff like that.  But we have a lot of holes that go out.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:28):**  Well, if you didn't cut that bird up, yeah, you don't know that that wing maybe has a  blemish.  Well, they don't find that out until they get it home, you know.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:37):**  So you have to be ready and okay with people calling and saying, hey, this bird has some  goofy thing.  And it's just no questions asked.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:43):**  We will replace it right now.  You know, that's the part of it that people don't that, you know, maybe the grocery store  or the restaurant is doing for you.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:02:53):**  When you're doing the direct to consumer, you've got to be prepared to take on that.  And, you know, there again, my wife takes care of that.  And one thing on our farm is everybody has a farm job as well.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:07):**  I mean, our three families to support and the farm is not supporting three families.  So my wife actually is your counterpart for Maya.  So no, I think we're friends.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:21):**  We we are.  There's, there's, we're friends.  So we're, there's, you know, I actually have a lot of respect for Maya, because there's  
**[1:03:29-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:29):**  not a lot of us are doing what we're doing.  And so if we can give you guys competition to choose, then we're not a monopoly.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:38):**  From that end, and I think we just kind of joke about it.  But she's, I don't know about your situation.  She is pretty much it.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:45):**  You know, she's the only one.  I saw her in Myrtle Beach, and her and I both were running around with with chicken chickens  who got their head cut off because we were just, you know, everywhere and talking with  
**[1:03:57-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:03:57):**  everyone.  So we briefly bumped into each other.  So hi, Annalise.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:01):**  Yeah, I kept texting her.  I said, How did you talk to CK?  Well, briefly, you know, blue eye.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:08):**  Yeah, yes.  So she's dealing with that as well as doing the farm stuff.  I mean, it's a lot of work.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:15):**  If she's doing anything close to what I'm doing, it's a lot of work.  And there's, there's not a deficit of things that need to be done.  And I, I'm not doing any farm stuff.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:25):**  So I cannot imagine having to actually balance those two or three loads, actually, is what  it sounds like.  So a lot of props to you, you guys for keeping sane.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:37):**  I guess my question is, how do you guys not burn out if you're doing all this work?  That's I think, another big question that came up, you know, our sheet, our burnout,  are you getting away?  
**[1:04:51-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:51):**  We're really lucky.  So I do the day to day chores, most of the time.  My brother lives about eight miles away from the farm.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:04:58):**  I live here, I live across the road from our shop, my parents, and then our main where  our animals are about five miles away.  So I just logistically, it works great.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:05:09):**  I like doing, you know, the working in the business thing is kind of my thing.  I love the three dogs in the truck, and we go up and do chores.  But the where we're really blessed is for Annalise and I, when we went to the school,  
**[1:05:26-1:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:05:26):**  you know, I text my brother, call him and talk to my brother, hey, we're gonna be gone.  Hey, no problem.  I got it.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:05:32):**  It's covered.  You know, we really we're really lucky.  We don't have to worry, we can get away that way.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:05:37):**  The only time we get into trouble is if we want to go to a family reunion or a wedding,  when all of us want to be gone at the same time.  So but and then you got to work around your delivery.  
**[1:05:50-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:05:50):**  So next weekend, we're hoping to go up to we have a lake place up in Battle Lake, Minnesota  that my, my grandpa was built back in the 60s.  My parents own it now.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:02):**  But to get away, we're going to go up and meet with some friends of ours in the region  world, you know, and just hash out one of them has been to RFP and he actually changed.  They changed their whole operation in 20 days after they went.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:17):**  It was pretty amazing.  You  uncommon.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:20):**  No, he'd be wanting to get on your Cody kolodji.  He's up in North Dakota.  Super nice guy.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:31):**  Super nice.  I met him a couple years ago through some friends and we've gone out there now and visit  them a couple times and they've come up.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:38):**  Yeah, they sold all their cows went to the heifers.  I'm kind of interested to hear about your experiences with the CSA model that you had  done in Wisconsin and why you've chosen to not go back down that route.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:06:57):**  Part of the reason for not going back as my brother kind of had this set up up here, what  he was already doing kind of a small customer base.  I actually like the CSA model.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:07:09):**  I think it's a really good model for people getting started.  Reason being is that you get paid up front.  In the model I had, I made people pay for a six six months subscription.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:07:22):**  So every six months, I had to up and they had a big I had a two two options.  It was either big or small at the time, different poundages.  I still think that it's a very valid model because you take some of the thinking away  
**[1:07:42-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:07:42):**  from it.  I think we suffer now in our current business is we have so many options that some of our  customers I think get nervous.  
**[1:07:51-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:07:51):**  How do I pick you know, all these different cuts and with a CSA, I just decided, you know,  this is what the pack was going to be, you know, and you'd get, I always made sure that  they had the ground.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:08:05):**  You know, they always had ground beef, probably some ground pork, and they always had a whole  chicken every month that was always there that was always consistent.  And then I would put in different prime cuts, you know, lamb chops, if they wanted lamb.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:08:20):**  That was the one thing that I didn't do for sure if they didn't like lamb, I just didn't  do it.  But otherwise, you know, steaks, pork chops, roasts, stuff like that.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:08:30):**  But the beauty of that is you could put in, okay, we have these beef ribs that for some  reason nobody wants.  Well, this month CSA is going to have beef for a minute.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:08:44):**  You know, it's like, it's like the vegetable folks.  Well, if you don't like kale, well, you better figure out what to do with kale because in  the spring, that's all you're getting.  
**[1:08:53-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:08:53):**  You signed up for his box, you're getting kale, figure it out.  Yeah, so it takes out that piece of, you know, maybe have an odd cuts around here and there.  Because we do struggle with that every once in a while.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:10):**  But there again, Annalise, I mean, I can't, I cannot lift her up enough because of what  she does with her marketing.  She will figure it out.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:21):**  You know, how do we push these things?  But then it goes to the other side.  So we get chicken backs.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:25):**  What are you gonna do with chicken backs?  We actually compost a lot of our chicken backs.  They go back on the pastures from which they came.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:33):**  What we keep it back.  I've never heard that term.  Okay, so we part out, I was telling CK, we part out most of the chickens that go through  
**[1:09:42-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:42):**  our processing facility get parted out into boneless skinless breasts, drummies, thighs,  boneless thighs, if people really don't like us, that's really a pain in the butt.  So then at the end, you have this carcass.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:09:59):**  Well, we personally would turn that into soup, you know, and we're looking at doing more  broth and stuff because we have an on farm store that we're starting to really build  up.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:10:09):**  Okay.  So we'll save back these backs in, I forget how many we put in a pack, I said four, I  think in a pack, and people will buy them to make chicken stock.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:10:21):**  Well, you save a bunch of these and then you end up with 150 bags of chicken backs that  nobody wants taken up very valuable freezer space.  So then you don't do as many.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:10:34):**  Well, Lisa was just talking this morning about, we're pretty much out of them now because  it's become a trend and we were she was able to advertise enough and people are going,  Oh, yeah, I should make I should make my own chicken stock.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:10:46):**  So all of a sudden, you're out of them.  Same goes for tongue, beef tongue.  Now you'll open the freezer.  
**[1:10:53-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:10:53):**  You know, it's like a gory movie.  And then two months later, people are begging for it.  Where did you know?  
**[1:11:01-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:01):**  Why is it here?  I don't understand beef or liver is another one.  It goes in waves.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:07):**  We've got boxes or just like totally random.  Is it seasonal or random?  That's a good question.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:15):**  It's probably seasonal.  And I think it has to do with how you advertise or what's going on in the media if they're  saying well, you know, chicken broth or beef liver is the magic food of the month.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:29):**  I love tongue toots.  Like, oh, so tender.  Brian, have you had tongue tockers?  
**[1:11:40-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:40):**  No.  Without getting into it, I'm, I'm kind of a picky eater, I suppose.  Organ meats, liver, I think grass fed beef liver.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:11:55):**  I think when word gets out about how much of a superfood grass fed beef liver is, I  don't think we'll be able to raise grass fed cattle fast enough.  Yeah, yeah, and we're starting to find that out.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:12:07):**  That paper they just published, right about regenerative food and how it has so many more  nutrients and it's actually cited.  It's peer viewed, it's scientific.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:12:20):**  Somebody posted that on Facebook.  They must have been at a conference.  It was up what the food nutrient value or percentages were in what 1950 or 30.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:12:30):**  I can't remember the date to now.  I mean, to me, that's just like, whoa.  Nutrient density of food.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:12:37):**  That's something that Fred Provenza talks about a lot.  Yeah, I don't have my beard going on.  For a while, I was telling my wife because I don't have any hair on top.  
**[1:12:48-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:12:48):**  I said, Fred Provenza is my smarter older man doppelganger.  He has, I want to be like him when I hold her.  Fred has an amazing beard or he did last time I saw him.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:02):**  It was just, it comes out.  It was beautiful.  It's just this beautiful white beard.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:06):**  Yeah, I always joke about that.  This is maybe the wisdom will come with the beard.  I don't know because that guy is so smart.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:17):**  Some day we'll get them on this podcast.  Some day we'll get around.  Him, Elon Musk, and hopefully Joe Rogan.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:29):**  Yeah, but yeah, it's for the CSA model.  I'd like to say I can rabbit trail, but the CSA model is a great model.  And I would definitely say for people thinking that are listening about kind of dipping their  
**[1:13:42-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:42):**  toe into the direct consumer, it's a great way to go because for one, you get paid up  front that's handy.  And then for two, you don't end up with these odd cuts.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:13:55):**  That would be my biggest points on those.  We've gone to the model, the delivery model right now.  We have the on-farm store.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:02):**  We use Gray's Cart.  There are other platforms out there that has its pros and cons.  For us, it works.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:13):**  Do you ship or are you all delivery?  We have shipped.  It's very expensive.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:20):**  What's that?  You said expensive, not inexpensive, right?  Expensive.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:27):**  Okay.  We have shipped a couple of things, not too far out of state.  Some people that are not in our delivery, but the majority of our stuff goes on a weekly  
**[1:14:37-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:37):**  delivery or this last year when I was looking at the numbers, we've actually, our weekly  deliveries are about neck and neck with our store.  But what Annalise would do is somebody would order for on-farm pickup.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:14:52):**  She packed the order, put it in a freezer at the end of our driveway in a store, and  they could come at their convenience and pick it up when it worked.  And that's growing.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:01):**  And we'd like to push that one a lot more for our more local people.  We'll get your names on it, come in.  It's already taken care of.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:09):**  That actually works out really slick.  What's your model for the on-farm store?  I know there's several different models.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:19):**  I know one that's a farm store that has operating hours, but it'll set things out for pickup  like you described.  But if you don't have your order in and it's after hours, wait until tomorrow.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:33):**  And then I know some operations that are basically a 24-hour come in, get what you need, scan  your items on the way out, and thanks for your business.  So, which way are you guys going with that?  
**[1:15:46-1:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:46):**  We're looking at going the ladder.  We're thinking about going where we're going to be open all the time for the most part.  Where are our stores, it's actually at the end of our driveway and there's people around  
**[1:15:59-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:15:59):**  all the time.  I'm not too worried about things.  And everybody we've talked to that does that model, at the end of the year or whenever  
**[1:16:08-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:08):**  they figure out their numbers, they've always been ahead, never behind.  Because that's always one big concern.  Would somebody come and steal a bunch of ribeyes?  
**[1:16:19-1:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:19):**  And they said, we've never had that.  Normally, people just don't even want to make change and they just leave it the way it is.  You end up ahead at the end of the year.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:26):**  So I thought, well, that's not a bad deal.  And I think that's kind of a point about theft and people worried about theft from a farm  store.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:35):**  In this day and age, a drug addict is more likely to steal the transformer off the back  of the building so he can sell the copper for money than he is to go steal food.  He's going to have to keep cold and is going to perish.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:47):**  That's going to be difficult defense.  If somebody is stealing food out of your store, they're probably stealing to eat.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:16:55):**  And in that case, we got to figure out why is that?  That's a social problem, not a criminal problem.  Yeah.  
**[1:17:03-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:03):**  And where we are, we're not too worried about it.  So we're actually launching this month, officially launching the store.  It's been there.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:15):**  We haven't really advertised it too much except for the on-farm pickup deal, which is nice  because you can pop over and fill the bags.  We have these really bright bags with our logo and everything.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:27):**  We want people's neighbors to see them.  That's why we have them that way.  So I mean, go buy any housing developments that we bring all this stuff into that, oh,  
**[1:17:35-1:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:35):**  what's that?  It's not an Amazon box.  It's definitely something different.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:40):**  It's a Walker Farms food box.  Yeah.  And when you drive down, you wonder why we drive into places.  
**[1:17:47-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:17:47):**  I think if we could just serve as this neighborhood, that's all you'd need as a small family farm.  That's a lot of people.  And I think that's something else that is underestimated is the amount of food that  
**[1:18:06-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:18:06):**  we can produce and how many people that will sustain in such a small area.  There's a sign somewhere up in Northeast Kansas along the interstate that I can remember going  by as I was growing up.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:18:21):**  And it's every Kansas farmer feeds 55 people in you.  And then it was 76 people in you.  And then it was like 95 people in you.  
**[1:18:29-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:18:29):**  And it was over 100.  And I think it's like, it's over 150 now.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:18:34):**  Yeah.  And when you think about it that way, like, I don't have to grow food for this giant community.  I don't have to serve them.  
**[1:18:44-1:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:18:44):**  I just have to serve a small part of it.  I just have to find that 150, 200 loyal customers that are going to buy from me most of the  time and take care of them and not worry about necessarily trying to, I mean, scalability  
**[1:19:00-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:00):**  is a term.  But where's the limit to scalability?  Like do we need to be reaching past that 200 customer mark that can sustain us and sustain  
**[1:19:10-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:10):**  our businesses?  Or just as a hypothetical number?  Our capitalist society wants us to grow and expand because that's how we make money.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:20):**  That's how you get more investment.  But that's not necessarily always the longest term success option, I suppose.  We don't necessarily need to have things that are scalable past a certain size, but they  
**[1:19:36-1:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:36):**  need to be replicatable on massive scale, in massive numbers.  Yeah.  Well, and what is scaling?  
**[1:19:44-1:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:44):**  Is scaling increasing your numbers or increasing your offering?  We offer a lot of things.  It sounds like a crazy deal.  
**[1:19:53-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:19:53):**  Well, we also, how do we expand while we sell butter from a Millerville butter that's...  My dad's back in the day, back in the early eighties, he did a lot of bees.  Well, this last year he got back into bees.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:20:09):**  So he's, that eventually is going to be something that will offer his honey.  And I think that's kind of part of his retirement plan is the bees.  He really, really enjoys it though.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:20:17):**  It fills his cup and he made these beehives.  They're a totally, I forget what they call them.  It's a different design, but we did get a little honey this year.  
**[1:20:29-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:20:29):**  He did give me some for Christmas.  He says, this is the most expensive honey you will ever have.  But eventually it should go.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:20:36):**  But yeah, instead of expanding numbers or acres, can you stack the enterprises?  I think that's definitely a different way to expand for sure.  Shifting gears a little bit.  
**[1:20:54-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:20:54):**  Before George and I got going today, we were talking a little bit about show world genetics  and lambing and farrowing times of year and how we've kind of departed, how some of the  pressure from the show world and like we specifically called out 4-H, I'll do it again.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:21:15):**  You don't have to own that if you don't want to.  How some of these programs that are designed to introduce young people into the world of  animal husbandry, maybe necessarily have led us off the rails in as far as what we need  
**[1:21:30-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:21:30):**  to be looking at for animal confirmation, genetics, and just generally how animals need  to be cared for to survive in a more natural environment without a lot of inputs.  Something that my friend Bob Kinford and I have talked about at length, and I think it  
**[1:21:54-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:21:54):**  might've been mentioned in his episode is in the show world, they kind of want the steers  to look like heifers and they want the heifers to look like steers.  They want this uniform rectangle body shape that you kind of have to crawl underneath  
**[1:22:09-1:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:22:09):**  and get a close up inspection.  Very true.  They want them to look like blocks.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:22:14):**  That's what they call them, bricks.  But then on the opposite side, you've got guys like Kit Farrow, you've got guys like  Doug Ferguson, Johan Zietzmann, who say that there needs to be a large difference in appearance  
**[1:22:29-1:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:22:29):**  between your males and your females.  Specifically, you want your bulls to look like they're walking uphill when they're on  level ground.  
**[1:22:37-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:22:37):**  You want them to be heavy up front, light in the back.  How is you want to be the opposite?  You want them to look like they're going downhill on level ground, have big butts, big butts  
**[1:22:45-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:22:45):**  and deep guts.  We don't see that in the show world.  Something else that we hear repeated in the grass-fed world and what we need to be looking  
**[1:23:00-1:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:23:00):**  at as far as grass-fed genetics.  We look at hair coat because hair coat is indicator of hormonal balance.  Hormonal balance is directly affected by diet.  
**[1:23:13-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:23:13):**  How are we judging the hair coat on an animal in a ring when somebody spent six hours blow  drying and coloring and trimming that animal's hair?  Is that really a fair evaluation of that animal's hormonal balance or is it a fair evaluation  
**[1:23:30-1:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:23:30):**  of that person's grooming skills?  Oh yeah, it's very phenotypical.  Let's see here.  
**[1:23:38-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:23:38):**  It's mostly hair.  It's like a small dog that looks big, but it's mostly hair.  How could we … I see this as an issue.  
**[1:23:53-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:23:53):**  I hope I didn't just offend everybody and make everybody too awful.  I was throwing a little bit of shade at 4-H. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of value  in that program and the skills that it teaches young people.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:24:05):**  What I am saying is should we look at that and should we look at some parts of that and  say, maybe this is really not that great for our industry and maybe we should change this.  It's changed dramatically even in our lifetime.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:24:22):**  We're of similar age.  When I was first in 4-H, especially in the … You've seen it a lot in the swine world,  at least where we are.  
**[1:24:32-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:24:32):**  You used to have animals that were judged.  I remember my dad helping us pick out show animals when you're picking out for the  meat quality.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:24:41):**  What would you want to bring that a packer would have wanted to buy at the time, let's  say?  It's very different now from what it was then.  
**[1:24:51-1:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:24:51):**  I mean, the way the animals … Your females, you were looking for a mothering ability or  could they produce a calf or produce a litter efficiently and effectively.  Now, well, we can attest to that, especially in the swine side of it because we use 50%  
**[1:25:13-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:25:13):**  Berkshire pigs in everything.  The reason for that is a flavor profile.  We found that the fat on a Berkshire is very distinct flavor, but where you struggle to  
**[1:25:26-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:25:26):**  find non-show Berkshire genetics, we've got a couple of places we've found that when  you can get them, they're good, but we find that those show genetics, when we bring them  in, they fall apart because we're on a very … We don't baby things.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:25:46):**  Our swine is pasture.  We do farrow up.  We have these huts, but it's no crates or nothing like off heavy bedding and they're  
**[1:25:56-1:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:25:56):**  outside.  They have protection.  They have heavy bedding, but a lot of these animals can't perform on that, but in the  
**[1:26:04-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:26:04):**  show ring, they would probably do really well.  They're very muscled.  They can hardly walk.  
**[1:26:14-1:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:26:14):**  You see the same thing in the sheep and in the cattle?  Yeah, I see it.  Personally, I see it a little less so from what we're chasing.  
**[1:26:25-1:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:26:25):**  I have seen it more in the cattle.  The sheep, not so much we buy our feeders from a friend of ours and then we're doing  our own flock now or building up a Katahdin flock, which I used to have in Wisconsin.  
**[1:26:37-1:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:26:37):**  I used to do my own.  I had my own ewes then, sold them in O'Teer, but in the beef I have because we have bought  some feeders in and boy, they just lose condition really quick in the fall, comparably to our  
**[1:26:55-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:26:55):**  crosses that are left over from what I was doing.  They just don't hold up.  If you can get them in their prime and when it's great, we've got grass up to your belly  
**[1:27:04-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:04):**  button, that's great, but once you're past that point, they just do not winter well and  that's because they weren't bred that way.  They were bred either.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:14):**  They got really long legs, a lot of leg.  We don't eat a lot of leg on a beef, so I don't quite understand that.  They just don't hold up.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:26):**  They would if you went into a feed yard.  You can feed condition or fertility into any breed in any environment.  Yeah.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:36):**  How do you change that?  I don't know.  My nephew is five, my brother's son.  
**[1:27:44-1:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:44):**  He'll be in 4-H. I'm on board.  I love 4-H.  I mean, I had great experiences, but it has changed.  
**[1:27:53-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:27:53):**  The show ring has changed.  I mean, most of the people around us buy their animals as show animals or club cabs, that  kind of deal.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:28:07):**  My brother's like, well, we're going to have to break it to him because he's going to be  taking animals from our farm in there.  They just may not do real well on the show ring, but on the rail, when they do their  
**[1:28:18-1:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:28:18):**  premiums on the rail, they're going to do well.  I had a young man from the local high school spend a bunch of time with me last winter,  spring, and through most of the summer.  
**[1:28:33-1:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:28:33):**  Kind of helped him figure out which way he wanted to go.  When he started with me just a little over a year ago coming out, he wasn't quite sure  what he wanted to do, but he knew he wanted to do something regarding outside ranching  
**[1:28:46-1:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:28:46):**  cows.  By the time we got done with him, or I got done with him and he left, he decided that  he was going to go to college.  
**[1:28:56-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:28:56):**  He applied for some scholarships and he pretty much got a four-year scholarship to go for  agronomy with a focus in range management at Kansas State.  That's my little buddy Keaton Wisk.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:08):**  That's your shout out.  I knew that when you talked about it.  I was like, are you going to say his name?  
**[1:29:14-1:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:14):**  Cool.  Yep.  I'm not sure where I was going with that, but there's opportunities out there.  
**[1:29:22-1:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:22):**  I think that young people don't necessarily understand.  Oh, I remember.  Keaton grew up showing goats.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:29):**  Okay.  He'd been around showing cattle.  The first couple of weeks that we rode around together, we spent a lot of time just going  
**[1:29:39-1:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:39):**  out and just looking at cows.  I was learning from him.  I was like, evaluate this cow like she's in a show ring and tell me about her.  
**[1:29:50-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:50):**  Give me your honest feedback about her.  He would.  It was very instructive.  
**[1:29:59-1:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:29:59):**  The more we got to talking, when he would go show goats, he would just go to somebody  that had goats and pick out a good looking one out of the pasture, go clean it up and  then take it to the show ring.  
**[1:30:12-1:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:30:12):**  Like you said, he never would do that well.  He wouldn't do that well being judged against the others, but the same people year after  year kept coming back and giving more and more money to buy his show goats.  
**[1:30:26-1:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:30:26):**  Exactly.  It teaches other skills, intrinsic skills that you would get working on a farm.  Especially if you don't have that in your backyard.  
**[1:30:41-1:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:30:41):**  Just learning how to keep a schedule, actually having an end goal.  This is the day of the show.  I have to be here with my weight.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:30:47):**  I have to understand how to feed an animal and treat it if it gets sick.  I think those are things that I think 4-H does really well.  And record keeping.  
**[1:30:56-1:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:30:56):**  Oh yeah, the record keeping.  The record keeping.  That is a whole other deal, yes.  
**[1:31:03-1:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:03):**  There's a lot of good to that.  I would like to see it get back to where we have some using animals.  I think we need to influence that.  
**[1:31:13-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:13):**  They need to have a class of like, because they do have, because my sister-in-law is  actually 17, so she does all of the classes.  She does sheep, goat, pig.  
**[1:31:23-1:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:23):**  She's done poultry.  She's done sewing.  She's done garden.  
**[1:31:26-1:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:26):**  But they do nothing on pasture or rangeland.  They do nothing on, like they'll have a dairy class in market steers and market heifers,  but they don't have any kind of grass fed situations.  
**[1:31:41-1:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:41):**  And I think that that would be interesting if they could have that segment just pulled  into that.  Have a whole other class.  
**[1:31:49-1:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:49):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Extension is usually 10 or 15 years behind us and 4-H is a few years behind extension.  
**[1:31:55-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:55):**  Yeah.  So in 20 years, we'll go.  There you go.  
**[1:31:59-1:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:31:59):**  It'll trickle down eventually.  I hope.  No, it'll be, it'll be interesting to see, like say when my, my nephew gets in to see  
**[1:32:06-1:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:06):**  what happens and where that goes.  Cause we, you know, we're not going to buy and show animals.  They're going to be out of our, our herds.  
**[1:32:14-1:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:14):**  So, and I think on the swine side, we, we have these Burke crosses.  We had some Burke Durock crosses, just beautiful animals.  I know on our Facebook, Annalise had them up there, just beautiful animals and beautiful  
**[1:32:30-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:30):**  to look at and beautiful to look at on the plate too.  I mean, they're just delicious.  The fat was, you know, you can't, the eating experience was high.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:40):**  So that's important too.  And more and more people, I mean, some people get kind of down all the agriculture's, you  know, blah, blah, blah.  
**[1:32:48-1:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:48):**  That's not good.  This, that, and the other thing we see a lot of the other side of that in with the direct  marketing, that'd be another positive I would put.  
**[1:32:56-1:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:32:56):**  For example, last night we went, we get some brewers grains from a small brewery South  of us here that go to our pigs.  We mix it as a protein source.  
**[1:33:06-1:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:06):**  It's a pretty small part of our ration, but it does help offset some of the protein costs.  And some of it, we ended up just composting, but we've gotten to know these guys now over  the last couple of years.  
**[1:33:18-1:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:18):**  And so we took some folks that actually help us put your chicken chickens and at least  I went out with them last night and we were sitting there having our beer and one of the  owners comes up right behind me.  
**[1:33:30-1:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:30):**  I had my Walker farms sweater on and he slaps me on the back and he's like, Oh, it's our  favorite farmers really loud, you know, and there's what a hundred people in here.  These are our favorite farmers and thanks for that.  
**[1:33:44-1:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:44):**  What did we give?  We have my ham for Christmas.  That's the best ham I've ever had, you know?  
**[1:33:50-1:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:50):**  And I was just giddy.  I was giddy all the way.  I got back from chores for breakfast.  
**[1:33:54-1:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:33:54):**  I was telling Lisa, I said, you know, I just have to remember that when we're out there  dealing with, you know, some thing, you know, that happens and go, you know what, this people  care.  
**[1:34:06-1:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:06):**  You sometimes wonder, you're like, everybody's like, well, nobody cares what we're doing,  but they do.  They care.  
**[1:34:12-1:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:12):**  I mean, it just made me, I still makes me happy today, but it's that, you know, people,  we get a lot of good stuff like that.  And that actually helps.  
**[1:34:22-1:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:22):**  I think that's, you know, that's a cool story.  Thanks.  Thanks for sharing.  
**[1:34:28-1:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:28):**  So I want to know what your favorite hobby is off the farm.  My favorite hobby off the farm.  Well, what we need to get you back into.  
**[1:34:40-1:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:40):**  We have an airplane, so I fly I'm a pilot.  So we got a 1961, 72, and we're really lucky our, my dream world would be if we sold here  and I'd like to move and have my own grass strip and everything.  
**[1:34:55-1:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:34:55):**  I think that'd be awesome.  But we're only about four miles from the airport in Princeton.  So we have a hanger there.  
**[1:35:02-1:35:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:02):**  So when I get a chance, I like going flying.  That's one of my big things.  I play music, I write music.  
**[1:35:10-1:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:10):**  So I've been doing that for, I don't know, since I was 12.  So in the summertime, I'll go, what's that?  What instruments do you play?  
**[1:35:22-1:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:22):**  Dobro guitar, mandolin.  What is a Dobro?  Steel like a steel guitar.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:28):**  Okay.  Have you ever, you know, Jerry Douglas.  He's a world renowned Dobro player.  
**[1:35:34-1:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:34):**  He's on a stand though, right?  Mine actually, you could strap, it's like a guitar only it's the strings are up higher.  You couldn't actually press it down like a guitar.  
**[1:35:44-1:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:44):**  You got to use a bar.  And that's not my best.  I mean, guitar is probably my best instrument as far as what I play a lot, but I go and  
**[1:35:53-1:36:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:35:53):**  play at the breweries or we have a pizza farm.  We call it Elfo Mega farm that we sell meat to.  In the summer, every Thursday they do wood fired pizzas.  
**[1:36:04-1:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:04):**  So, and they have live music.  So I'll go play there every once in a while.  So that's, that's kind of my thing.  
**[1:36:11-1:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:11):**  Wood fired pizza sounds delicious.  Well, you'll have to come on up sometime and take you out.  You mentioned that one of these days I might, I might go back to flying and take a look  
**[1:36:25-1:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:25):**  at my pilot's license.  I kind of, I took a break front because money got a little tight for awhile.  So you know, one of the first things that needs to go is put on the shelf is flight  
**[1:36:38-1:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:38):**  training.  Then we had the wildfire.  Then I got wrapped up in clearing trees and then I hurt myself.  
**[1:36:45-1:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:45):**  So my eye, and since I've had that cataract surgery, my eyes are a little, are a little  strange.  Next time I have an eye doctor appointment in a couple months, I'll have to, I'll ask  
**[1:36:57-1:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:36:57):**  him if it's okay to okay.  If I can do that.  And then probably have to go back and redo a flight physical and, and get my students,  
**[1:37:05-1:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:37:05):**  get my students permit up to date.  But I did have a 30, somewhere between 32 and 34 hours towards my license.  Still had to do the cross countries, some solos night flight and class B, but other  
**[1:37:20-1:37:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:37:20):**  than that, I pretty much had everything checked off.  I soloed at eight and a half hours.  Oh, you did really good.  
**[1:37:28-1:37:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:37:28):**  Well, I, I, my instructor where he was teaching me, uh, I don't know what year, but I think  it was, uh, it was assessed a one 50 H model and it had some, had some flaps seals and  some other short takeoff tricks on it.  
**[1:37:43-1:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:37:43):**  We flew off of a 1200 foot grass strip with a one 50.  There you go.  I, that's where I learned.  
**[1:37:51-1:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:37:51):**  I learned barefoot and a one 50 off of a 1200 foot grass strip that had on one end, there  was a cornfield and a corn pivot.  Like there were pivot tracks across the south end of the runway, the north end of the runway.  
**[1:38:06-1:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:06):**  There was a highway right across the threshold.  The hangar was on one side of the north end and there was an electric substation on the  other end and coming in on approach.  
**[1:38:14-1:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:14):**  You had to come over on.  Finally, you had to come over two sets of power lines, a railroad track and the highway  and dump all your flaps in so you can get down in there.  
**[1:38:24-1:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:24):**  That was, yeah, that was coming in from the north with the south wind, or if the wind  was out of the north, you're coming over that corn pivot and trying to make sure you missed  all the gopher holes and wheel tracks.  
**[1:38:33-1:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:33):**  Yeah, yeah, that would do it.  Yeah, no, I don't.  I go to, we got a couple of little strips.  
**[1:38:39-1:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:39):**  We go up in battle Lake where like places that they have a grass strip, the airports  mile from our place.  So Lisa and I fly up there a lot.  
**[1:38:47-1:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:47):**  We, we want to get a little vehicle to stick up there.  You don't usually walk or have my dad or grandpa come get us.  But then with the airplane, we're, I'm really lucky.  
**[1:38:56-1:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:38:56):**  So my mechanic, he works for St. Cloud aviation, but he's trying to build ours.  So he flies our airplane.  So we just trade time for time.  
**[1:39:06-1:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:06):**  But my annuals and everything, we just trade hours.  I buy the parts he traded.  And then we have another gentleman who was actually a maintenance guy out on the wildlife  
**[1:39:18-1:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:18):**  refuge out here.  He's trying to build ours.  So he flies too.  
**[1:39:21-1:39:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:21):**  So we have a couple people that we, that helps offset some of the, I've had a couple of times,  but I've been, you know, oh, you know, really, should we be paying for this or have this?  Anna Lisa is actually the one that puts the kibosh on that every time.  
**[1:39:37-1:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:37):**  She's like, no, we're not selling the airplane.  So we used to have a 150.  And like I say, her folks are up in Virginia, Minnesota.  
**[1:39:47-1:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:47):**  It's about a three hour drive, but it's about a 40 minute flight to go to Evelith, which  is just down the road.  And one time we were taking off, it was just myself and Anna Lisa.  
**[1:39:57-1:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:39:57):**  And we had two dogs at the time.  It was warm.  There was a high pucker factor coming out of there.  
**[1:40:03-1:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:03):**  So I was like, you know what, maybe we need to think about getting something that's got  a little bit higher useful load.  For those that don't understand a 150 is a wonderful training airplane.  
**[1:40:13-1:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:13):**  They're very economical to operate.  But if more than you, your instructor and a map want to go anywhere, you need to have  something bigger.  
**[1:40:22-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:22):**  Yeah, I'm not a big guy, weigh about 160 pounds.  My flight instructor is very, very similar size or very similar height, weight, like  limb length, didn't have to adjust the seats or belts when we swap positions.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:37):**  And I could tell a huge difference when he wasn't in the plane.  Oh, absolutely.  It was like flying a leaf.  
**[1:40:42-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:42):**  That's what I always said.  You know, compared to the 172, which is, you know, it's four seater.  Ours is a 1960.  
**[1:40:49-1:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:49):**  So it's with the fastback.  So it's thousand pound useful loads.  It's a nice airplane and it, you know, it cruises, cruises nice.  
**[1:40:59-1:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:40:59):**  You can pack a bottle of water and a map.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:41:04-1:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:04):**  We can, we've had four, we had Lisa, myself, and then my cousin and her fiance.  And he was, you know, linebacker.  So he's like what, two, 10.  
**[1:41:14-1:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:14):**  And you know, we, it was, we did it.  It worked, but a lot of times what we do is we just take the back seat out.  Cause it's usually just Lisa and I and put the dogs back there and go wherever we, we,  
**[1:41:30-1:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:30):**  we couldn't load that thing enough.  I don't think so.  Another thing that's really fun to do in a 150 is get up about 5,000 feet, hang all the  
**[1:41:39-1:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:39):**  flaps out and pull the power to see if you can go backwards in the wind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:41:44-1:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:44):**  We, uh, I think I probably had about 10 hours.  My instructor took me up and there was about a 50 knot wind at 5,000 feet.  We went up there, got her dirty and we were going back.  
**[1:41:55-1:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:41:55):**  We were making negative seven over the ground.  Yeah.  Well at the 150, when we were coming, we had the 150 when we were working on moving back  
**[1:42:02-1:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:02):**  up here and we were coming up and looking at properties and stuff.  And I remember coming in on a windy day and I was flying to the west and you'd look down  and the cars on the highway were going a little bit faster than you, but on the way home,  
**[1:42:17-1:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:17):**  we were going 128 miles an hour or something like that on the ground.  So, well, there we go.  Yeah.  
**[1:42:23-1:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:23):**  That's a nice trip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:42:26-1:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:26):**  150s are great.  I think around here, I'd need something a little bit bigger.  I mean, just because of the wind, if there was no wind, if there wasn't going to be the  
**[1:42:34-1:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:34):**  chance of that 50, 60 mile an hour headwind, it wouldn't be that bad.  You need something a little quicker to 170, 150 out here to be able to buy winds and travel  anywhere.  
**[1:42:45-1:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:42:45):**  No, that's for sure.  One of the first times that I soloed, we were doing touch and goes in the pattern and like  we come in for the second one, my instructor said, go ahead, full stop and go up to the  
**[1:43:00-1:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:00):**  hanger.  Okay.  Went right up to the hanger and he just got out.  
**[1:43:04-1:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:04):**  He's like, go do that three more times.  Okay.  So, I did it three more times and then he jumped on the radio and said, now fly to Pratt  
**[1:43:13-1:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:13):**  and get gas.  It's like 15 miles away.  It's like, okay.  
**[1:43:18-1:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:18):**  I flew to Pratt and got gas.  Well, little did I know while I was messing around the pattern focusing on what I was  doing, he got his R44 helicopter out and got up in the air and was watching me fly.  
**[1:43:31-1:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:31):**  Oh, really?  Yeah, my instructor was chasing me around with his helicopter watching me fly.  You don't hear that every day.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:38):**  No.  I didn't even know it until I was on my way back from Pratt.  He's like, yeah, we're about a mile behind you and 2000 feet up on the left.  
**[1:43:46-1:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:46):**  Just watching you.  Just wanted to let you know we were here.  Like, oh, well, thanks.  
**[1:43:51-1:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:51):**  Yeah.  No, I don't get to fly as much as I want right now.  Well, when it's this cold, it's the best time to go.  
**[1:43:59-1:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:43:59):**  Really.  The air is so dense.  That was one Annalise got me for Christmas.  
**[1:44:05-1:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:05):**  Well, two years ago now I got a fancy deal on my phone.  So if I'm thinking about going flying, I can actually turn my block heater on from my phone.  Get the airplane nice and warmed up.  
**[1:44:16-1:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:16):**  Gets her nice and toasty beforehand.  But even in our heaters pretty good.  But even with that, she's pretty chilly in there.  
**[1:44:25-1:44:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:25):**  There's not a whole lot of insulation in those things.  I can remember some pretty cold flights because like I said, I learned barefoot because that's  how he flew.  
**[1:44:37-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:37):**  Okay, you want to fly barefoot?  I mean, I normally wear big giant work boots.  They didn't exactly fit in the foot well of 150.  
**[1:44:47-1:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:47):**  So like the first day I went up for my first flight, I was wearing my work boots.  He's like, those aren't even going to fit in the airplane.  You're just going to take them off.  
**[1:44:54-1:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:54):**  Like what?  Fly without shoes?  And he's like, I do it all time.  
**[1:44:58-1:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:44:58):**  Okay, fair enough.  So you'll jump in the plane, throw the boots behind the seat and go.  And that's just how I learned to fly.  
**[1:45:04-1:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:04):**  Yeah.  No, I always keep a pair on, you know, old sneakers or something at the hanger just in  case then, Oh, I'm going to go flying and to make sure if I have my work boots, because  
**[1:45:12-1:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:12):**  I don't, I can't, I don't even like having them like a hard-soled shoe on or something.  It's too much with the, in my opinion, but everybody's got their thing, I guess.  There was one day that it was, it was pretty cold and I wore my tennis shoes and I didn't  
**[1:45:29-1:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:29):**  like it about halfway through the flight.  I just, I had to kind of scoot the seat back a little bit, get my shoes off, throw them  behind the seat and kept going.  
**[1:45:36-1:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:36):**  Yeah.  It's just, just that little difference in feel matters so much.  Yeah.  
**[1:45:42-1:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:42):**  Well, on a 150, you don't have to do too much with the rudder, but even in the 172, it's  not too bad, but yeah, you'd like to know what's going on.  Well, crosswinds are life in Kansas.  
**[1:45:55-1:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:55):**  Like wind is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:45:58-1:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:45:58):**  I remember one day I was landing and the wind switched like while I was on the roll, all  of a sudden I'm like going down, it's not stopping.  It's not stopping.  
**[1:46:08-1:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:46:08):**  What the hell is going on?  And looked at the wind sock and the wind sock was at my back and I'm like, wait a minute.  I just went around and I swear I was leaning into a headwind because I'm not that dumb.  
**[1:46:19-1:46:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:46:19):**  It does that.  We go up to Brainerd for breakfast every once in a while.  That airport, yeah, the wind changes a lot.  
**[1:46:28-1:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:46:28):**  One time we came in and I told her, so we're going to make an approach in here.  And if we're not comfortable, we're leaving, we'll go home.  Got her landed, went in, have breakfast.  
**[1:46:35-1:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:46:35):**  And this guy came in and a cub and I thought, oh man, this is going to be interesting.  I mean, he had the tail end of that thing, trying to stop it up as well.  If he can do it, I guess we'll be okay.  
**[1:46:48-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:46:48):**  It was a little too windy for being out in a cub in my opinion.  Depends on how much motor's hanging off the front, but yeah, if we're just talking about  your standard yellow J3 cub.  
**[1:47:00-1:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:00):**  Yeah, it sounds like it was a little bit breezy for him that day.  So no, so that's the stuff we do.  We don't go flying.  
**[1:47:14-1:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:14):**  We like to go to the lake.  We don't get there as much as we want.  And at least likes going fishing a lot.  
**[1:47:18-1:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:18):**  So we don't, that's the one thing about going to RFP.  It's like, we got to get it.  We got to be able to get away sometime.  
**[1:47:25-1:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:25):**  You got to, you got to structure it so you can do that get away.  So you don't get burned out.  That is definitely one thing that they, they encourage in a school is to take time for  
**[1:47:37-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:37):**  the people.  And I think kind of dance around it a little bit, but one of the big concepts that they  really spend a lot of time on at Ranching for Profit is talking about the people dynamic  
**[1:47:51-1:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:47:51):**  and about how to deal with people problems.  In fact, one of the former instructors, I'll name him Alan Crockett, because he won't mind  me saying that Alan Crockett is kind of famous for saying, every problem is a people problem.  
**[1:48:08-1:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:48:08):**  And I think there's a lot of truth to that.  Yeah, that's, that's not what we mean.  We were all, I'm, you're probably like me, I prefer going out not having any people around,  
**[1:48:21-1:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:48:21):**  but that's not maybe healthy all the time either.  Oh, and that's a people problem of a different sort, I would say.  Exactly.  
**[1:48:31-1:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:48:31):**  Well, is there, is there anything I forgot to ask you, George, that you needed that we  need to talk about today?  Not that I can think of offhand, I mean, we'll have to get together again sometime and dive  
**[1:48:44-1:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:48:44):**  deeper into some of this, you know, direct marketing, which stuff like that, because  I think it has a place I think, I think it's one of those things that we got to be very  careful about how we approach it, because I would say a direct marketing end of your  
**[1:48:59-1:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:48:59):**  farm could take your farmer ranch down just as fast as having a, you know, 100% open cows.  So yeah, you know, you got to, I think it's a great thing.  It's something that we're, we're trying to refine, you know, because of the people issues,  
**[1:49:17-1:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:49:17):**  you know, the people part of it, how do we do this and do it well and do it so that we  can step away from it if we want to or need to.  So yeah, those kinds of things.  
**[1:49:30-1:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:49:30):**  There's, I don't know, I think we covered a bunch of stuff.  This was a this was a good time.  I'm kind of kind of spoiled to be able to do this in the afternoon here.  
**[1:49:41-1:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:49:41):**  Well, I sure appreciate you taking time out of your day to do this, especially on kind  of short notice.  So where can we find you on social media?  
**[1:49:51-1:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:49:51):**  So we got Walker Farms LLC, Princeton, Minnesota, for Facebook, I'm sure you can find it there.  Our website is Walker Farms, mn.com.  So it's plural, and then mn.com.  
**[1:50:11-1:50:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:50:11):**  That's probably the best way to catch us.  I don't do the the tick tock and the whole they're trying to get me to do that stuff.  I'm working on it.  
**[1:50:20-1:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:50:20):**  But pretty much I'm old school, the Facebook messenger.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yeah, wrong with that.  
**[1:50:27-1:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:50:27):**  I know Annalise is on some of the other ones, my brother's on Instagram and stuff like that.  I will apply my Google magic and see what other links I can come up with and make sure  they get in the show notes page.  
**[1:50:41-1:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:50:41):**  That's very much appreciated.  CK, thanks for joining us, even though it was a was a little bit late.  I'm not throwing shade.  
**[1:50:53-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:50:53):**  There's a little time zone confusion, but I'm glad you were able to cut fire in the  last two hours.  Yeah.  
**[1:51:02-1:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:02):**  Well, it's nice to actually talk with you, George, because I always appreciate all your  feedback and feel like you're one of our best listeners.  Yeah, I'm addicted.  
**[1:51:12-1:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:12):**  I'll admit.  I'm George and I do have a problem.  I like podcasts, especially this one.  
**[1:51:20-1:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:20):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  We keep episodes coming out weekly.  
**[1:51:25-1:51:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:25):**  Awesome.  All right.  I think we're going to go ahead and get out of here.  
**[1:51:30-1:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:30):**  Any final thoughts?  Going once?  Going twice.  
**[1:51:34-1:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/51-George-Walker-Multispecies-Grazing-in-Minnesota-e1ead4p#t=1:51:34):**  All right, y'all.  Have a great week.  Take care.

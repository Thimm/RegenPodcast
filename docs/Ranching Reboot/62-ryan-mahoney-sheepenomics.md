**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:01:25):**  Appreciate it.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you met CK?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:01:28):**  No, not officially.  I've been talking to you for the last five minutes and kind of the before the recording  started, but good to meet you, CK.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:01:38):**  Where in California are you?  I am in we call it the Sacramento River Delta.  So we are if you draw a line from San Francisco to Sacramento, we are right in the middle  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:01:49):**  there.  And we're kind of far enough away from freeways that we're still pretty small town.  Yeah, I think there's like 1800 people.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:01:56):**  Well, there was 1800.  Now I think it's like 6000 because they had a development going in the last 10 years.  But I grew up here.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:05):**  Left for college and came back and and yeah, we got a little, little nice little corner  of the world here.  Yeah, I like that area.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:11):**  I'm actually I went to Chico State for under.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:16):**  We lottery of instance go to Chico.  Are you downstream of Oroville Dam?  Yeah, we're way down.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:24):**  So we're actually in the mouth of the bay almost.  So we're fresh water.  But the but we're like just I mean, you can take a boat and in 30 minutes, you'll be in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:33):**  the bay.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:36):**  Yeah.  So tell us a little bit about Amy livestock.  Sure.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:40):**  So Amy livestock is I'm a fifth generation sheep rancher.  We, my family came here to the area and settled in like the 1870s.  They I was raised on the home ranch where they originally bought.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:02:59):**  And then my grandpa kind of took the ranch in the about the 50s.  And he really grew it to what it is today.  And then two years ago, I was able to buy the ranch from the family.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:03:09):**  And so now we successfully planned I had lunch with my grandpa today still around and giving  me lots of advice.  And I gladly accept.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:03:19):**  But yeah, so we're diversified livestock operation, we raise cows and cattle and sheep.  We have Angus cows.  We raise one third of them bred to Angus for replacement heifers for ourselves.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:03:37):**  And then the other two thirds we contract with Snake River Farms and bring in Wagyu  bulls and sell American Kobe beef calves to them to then sell to the marketplace.  And then we have it's delicious.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:03:52):**  Yeah.  I like is that a dog behind you there?  He's got he looks famous.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:02):**  That's a face radio right there.  You should hear when he snores.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:09):**  That's awesome.  So then we have sheep too.  We raise we have, I think right now we have around 4000 mother use that we they're all  
**[0:04:17-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:17):**  fine wooled ramble lays.  We raise the meat lambs and sell them to Superior Farms fat and we sell the wool to Imperial  yarn out of Oregon.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:29):**  And then they make all sorts of fun stuff with it.  We also have irrigated pasture where we buy in feeder cattle and buy in feeder lamb and  we back around the cattle and then we'll sell fat lambs off the clover.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:41):**  And then anything that doesn't sell off of the clover of the lamb side, we run through  a lamb feedlot right here in Dixon, California.  So we're pretty diversified in a lot of different segments.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:04:56):**  But not huge in any one, I guess.  Okay.  I've never actually heard of a lamb feedlot.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:05:03):**  And to be honest, before we like right before we started, I had the I had a question come  in.  Sure.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:05:11):**  And maybe maybe we can kind of use this to frame a lot of the discussion yet to come.  One of my patrons, William Cagney asked, why not sheep from a cattleman's perspective?  And since you're a guy that's obviously involved in both in a very diversified operation, I'd  
**[0:05:30-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:05:30):**  love to hear your take on that because and where I'm going with this, you know, a lot  of us are really looking at our input costs and, and the calf market and what everything  costs these days.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:05:42):**  And I think a lot of people really need to find another way to generate a revenue source  off their land without taking something off the plate from what they're already doing.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:05:53):**  So why why she Why not sheep?  It's a great question to ask.  If you look at a lot of other countries, a lot of cow ranches have sheep.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:06:05):**  In California, there's kind of more or in California in the US, there's more of a stigma  seems like between cowboys and Jeep ranchers, probably because they went to war in 1800s  and in the mountain states, but on our on our ranch, the sheep and cattle have to be  
**[0:06:23-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:06:23):**  run together for us to be as successful as we possibly can.  Sheep and cattle target different species of grasses.  They we feel they create healthier pastures.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:06:36):**  parasites that pass through cows die when they try to pass through a sheep and vice  versa.  Sheep parasites die when they try to pass through cows.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:06:44):**  So if you're on an intensive operation, running those species together does help with parasite  control doesn't eliminate it, but it helps.  And just I don't know, I heard one time that if you run like one sheep underneath a cow,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:06:59):**  oftentimes they can run year round and you won't even notice they're there as far as  what they're taking food stuff wise.  Now if you're supplementing them, you know, seven months out of the year, then you probably  
**[0:07:08-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:07:08):**  have to supplement that sheep too.  So it won't be so free.  But on a pure grass year round deal, you know that that sheep really does benefit that operation  
**[0:07:17-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:07:17):**  and then the markets aren't they're related, but they're unrelated.  So in the cattle market, it's been kind of flat.  I think there's a lot of opportunity in the cattle market right now.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:07:29):**  I think we've been primed up to get a run for the last, gosh, three or four years, it  seems like so I keep thinking it's coming.  But two years ago, when when COVID hit, we had a collapse of the sheep market and then  
**[0:07:42-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:07:42):**  just an absolute record run.  And we're still just kind of we're kind of correcting off of that record run.  But it's really nice to have both species and kind of hedge those markets against each  
**[0:07:54-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:07:54):**  other.  So it's been really beneficial for us economically, you know, sheeponomically or ranchonomically  to have both species.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:04):**  Sheeponomically.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:07):**  You got to put that on my t-shirt.  I titled our last podcast.  So it just is on top of my head.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:17):**  Well, it's a good segue to mention your podcast.  We can circle back around to that one later.  So what's your podcast about?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:25):**  Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to shameless plug there.  But yeah, so me and Dan Macon started a podcast called Sheep Stuff You Should Know a couple  of years back.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:37):**  And we since record also with Dr. Roselle Bush, who's a veterinarian at a Davis.  And we just talk about sheep, also all things sheep.  And we just kind of sit down and have conversations.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:52):**  So yeah.  Okay.  Do you talk about sheep too much?  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:55):**  And you want to talk about your cows today?  Oh, for sure.  For sure.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:08:59):**  No.  Yeah, I mean, it's cheaper.  Sheep are such an incredible species.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:06):**  They're very complimentary to any kind of beef ranch.  They bring a lot to the table that diversify your markets.  They help your animal husbandry skills, I feel quite a bit.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:17):**  Because they kind of display their illnesses slightly differently.  You have to anticipate things differently.  And it's made be a better cow man by running sheep.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:27):**  You're not the first person that I've heard say that.  Yeah, it's I think it's fairly true.  I think it's fairly true.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:36):**  What you said about like how they show sickness.  I had I was having a conversation.  I can't remember with who about sheep.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:45):**  And maybe it was a podcast I heard but it was the sheep are more they can better hide  their illness.  And you gotta hide it right from a predator perspective.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:09:56):**  And yeah, the reason people are saying that sheep are just looking for a place to die  is because they're not very good stockman or they're not a good enough stockman to see  that that animal has been sick for two, three, four days.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:10:08):**  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a big part of it.  The other part of that is kind of the contrary to complement the beef side.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:10:17):**  Cows are so resilient, they're able to, you can have a cow that's lived 15 years and then  you do an E crops the owner and you find the 47 things that she's been living with for  the last five and you're shocked that she lives so long.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:10:31):**  Sheep, but sheep have a very high pain tolerance.  And so they they very much especially if there's any sort of stress, like you bring them into  the corrals to work them like in our area, we have a lot of soil moisture during the  
**[0:10:44-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:10:44):**  winter months and so we get a lot of foot rot.  And you'll go and you'll drive slowly through a field and you'll see all these sheep with  foot rot limping a little bit.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:10:53):**  And then you bring them into the crowds and you start looking at them and you don't see  any because they're all hiding it when they're in the corrals.  And so it's really hard to see those diseases as they're developing in the in the sheep  
**[0:11:06-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:11:06):**  and cattle or in the sheep, whereas cows, it's a little more obvious when they're sick,  but cows present plenty of challenges.  I mean, you're dealing with a 1200 pound animal and trying to try to ban handle it and doctor  
**[0:11:19-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:11:19):**  it before the illness gets too bad.  That's a huge challenge on its own.  Sheep you can train dogs to help take them down, you can you can get to them a little  
**[0:11:29-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:11:29):**  easier and handle it a little easier.  So there's challenges to both but and I keep coming back to they're different but being  able to know the differences has made me more in tune with both, I guess is probably how  
**[0:11:42-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:11:42):**  I would say it.  So I can understand that.  I think part of what I just heard you say was, when sheep are out of the pasture, they're  
**[0:11:53-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:11:53):**  a little bit stressed, even if they are in the pasture, you're not going to see their  true state, like they're going to hide that illness from you.  As soon as they as soon as they sense a little bit of stress, they're going to hide that  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:05):**  illness from me.  That's what I think I heard you say.  Yeah, they're very stoic.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:08):**  Yeah.  Very interesting.  Interesting.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:11):**  And they also hate being separate.  So any anytime you separate a sheep off from its from its herd, that that's that's much  more stressful for them than when you like you have a cow that's a little sick, you can  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:24):**  peel her off.  And she's not as stressed.  You try to peel a sheep off in the same manner and it won't work near as well unless she's  
**[0:12:31-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:31):**  very, very sick.  But and it's because of that, that herding instinct in the two it's a it's the same herding  instinct but one stronger in the sheep and the cow.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:41):**  Cows are more independent, I think.  Well, like our cows, you know, a decent sized cow herd a lot of times, you know, they'll  split up into, you know, subgroups and go to different parts of the pasture.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:52):**  Yeah.  And I'm sensing sheep don't do that, that they just they stick in one.  No, not really.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:12:58):**  They kind of stay together for the most part.  I've actually heard that goats are the biggest clicky-ish type animal.  They actually create little groups of like six to 10.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:08):**  And they that's what they stay with.  They look they kid together, they graze together, like they're all synced up in these little  tiny clicks, which is fascinating to me.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:20):**  I'm not a big fan.  I don't run goats.  I had goats at one time and I'm glad I don't have them right now.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:25):**  But I learned that the other day.  I thought it was fascinating.  Yeah, I thought you were going to say they're fiercely independent.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:31):**  And that's why they get into everything.  Well, that's a whole nother issue.  But no, they're very clicky.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:35):**  So it's like, yeah, five to six of them get into everything.  Yeah.  Interesting.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:44):**  Cows are kind of like in between those two extremes.  Okay.  So you said you had fine-wooled rambouillet.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:13:54):**  Yeah.  So that implies that every once in a while that they're peeled.  Yep.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:01):**  So what's that process like?  And what do you do with the wool?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:07):**  So what does that mean?  Okay, you guys call it peeled?  Oh, that's interesting.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:12):**  Oh, you can call it all sorts of things.  But yeah, peeling them.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:16):**  Peeling an orange.  Yeah, getting that fleece off.  So we shear once a year.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:23):**  That's what our sheep require.  We shear around April 1st.  So we literally just finished it two weeks ago.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:31):**  We hire in a crew of sheep shears and the sheep shearing crews go around the state or  nation depending on what kind of crew they are and shear sheep for a living.  We pay them $5.30 a head this year, which is very expensive.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:47):**  When I started 15 years ago, it was like three bucks.  How many can they do in an hour?  I'm going to do a quick minute.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:14:55):**  They do around 100 a day on our sheep.  It depends on the size of the sheep and how much.  Like one of the things that slow them down is leg wool.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:15:06):**  So the more wool down the legs and into the face, the slower it takes them to shear.  The less wool on the legs and the less wool on the face, the easier it is to you're just  shearing the center part of the sheep.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:15:21):**  And so like a really clean sheep where you just, they probably, some of your really good  shears can do 200 to 300 a day.  But most of our guys, they do around 100 of our kind of sheep and we have a really big  
**[0:15:37-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:15:37):**  frame sheep.  So our ewe is about 190 pounds, 180 to 90 pounds.  So she's a pretty big sheep.  
**[0:15:46-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:15:46):**  And she has about nine pounds, nine and a half pounds of clean fleece wool.  So she produces about 11 to 12 pounds of total wool, but you have to take out the stuff that  has manure on the back, the bellies come out because when they're laying down, it mats  
**[0:16:02-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:16:02):**  the wool on the belly and that has to get cleaned in a different process.  The wool on the top of the head and the shoulders get kind of skirted out just because of the  way it grows.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:16:13):**  It's the same wool, but it just presents itself a little differently.  So it has to go through a different process.  And then the clean fleece wool, that's the stuff on the sides and the back for the most  
**[0:16:24-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:16:24):**  part.  Our wool is about four inches long after a year's worth of growth.  They measure the diameter of the wool and ours is about a 21 and a half micron.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:16:37):**  22 and up micron, when you put it against your skin in a garment is itchy.  Under 22, it's not itchy.  And so your really fine fancy wooled suits are going to be like 18, 19 micron wool.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:16:51):**  Do they have it on the tags?  So if I look for that, will I see that?  Some places advertise it, but it's...  
**[0:17:00-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:17:00):**  So if you shoot like we shear, you know, if 4,000 years that we shear, our average micron  is 21 and a half.  Within that clip of wool, you have 19 micron to 24 micron.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:17:14):**  Yeah, you have a bell curve.  And so to be able to say like, this is definitely 21 micron wool is kind of...  It gets into that marketing gray area and there's plenty of marketing.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:17:27):**  So you can definitely find like 19 micron and under wool for different things.  But a lot of it...  A lot of them won't put it on the tag, but if you start getting to know different wool  
**[0:17:42-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:17:42):**  companies, some do better than others at having consistent quality wool.  And when you get into your really high end suits, they're going to be nice.  So I mean, you're going to spend four or $500 on a suit.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:17:56):**  It better be nice or else you're going to not be in business.  I feel like the uniforms that I had in the Navy were about 35, maybe 36 microns.  So there's a thing called the Brady Amendment, which requires stuff for the US military if  
**[0:18:14-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:18:14):**  it can be to be bought and sourced in the US.  So a lot of the US wool clip goes to the military.  And so, yeah, you got a lot of good American wool in that.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:18:25):**  And it's probably sitting around the 22, 23 microns, especially your coats and jackets.  The pea coat sometimes almost seemed a little bit softer than the Navy blue pants.  Yeah, it makes sense.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:18:40):**  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  The wool industry has gone through a lot of challenges and changes over the last 20, 30  years.  
**[0:18:50-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:18:50):**  It used to be a ton of manufacturing up and mostly in the northwest or northeast.  But then in the 90s, when stuff was getting outsourced and China was growing, all that  production went overseas.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:19:02):**  And you had a couple of really fantastic companies, Charger's down in South Carolina and Boldman's  down in Texas.  So pretty much the two cleaning plants that are left in the US.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:19:13):**  And so all the wool kind of has to go through there and majority of the wool gets exported  now.  And so it's really just gone through this crazy change.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:19:23):**  But then in the last couple of years, it seems like there's a resurgence of demand for locally  sourced wool and US sourced wool.  A lot of it is you look at the marketing campaigns for your polyester, like your Nike undershirts  
**[0:19:37-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:19:37):**  and stuff and it all says, we need moisture wicking and doesn't smell and this is a breathable  fabric, but wool is naturally breathable, naturally doesn't smell, naturally more moisture  wicking.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:19:52):**  And so it really fits the, and it's biodegradable.  And it literally you trim it off and it grows right back again.  So it's not a, you're not pulling it out of the ground and use it at one time.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:20:04):**  It's a regenerative product.  And so it really fits a lot of the marketing plans and consumer demands of a lot of people  nowadays.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:20:14):**  And so that's kind of exciting.  That kind of led us to start marketing our wool through Imperial Yarn up out of Oregon  because that's what they're based on is a climate beneficial wool from places that don't  
**[0:20:29-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:20:29):**  have negative carbon footprints.  And actually, it's a US processed wool and so it's sourced locally and you can trace  it back to where it came from and stuff like that.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:20:43):**  And so it's really been kind of fun to watch.  We've been doing that for four years now, five years almost, and it's been pretty successful.  I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to ask, what happened to the wool after  
**[0:20:56-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:20:56):**  it left the farm?  You said, so it's got to go from your place to the two cleaning plants and then it goes  like right back to where you're at just up the road to Imperial.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:06):**  It's even crazier than that.  So it goes from our sheep, this year takes it off, it goes into a bale and then we put  the bale in our barn.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:15):**  Then we take that bale and we put it on a truck and we ship it down to a warehouse in  Bakersfield.  Bakersfield, they do the core tests.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:22):**  So they have to sample every bale to see what the wool is.  And then they test that wool in a lab in New Zealand in order to tell you your diameter,  your strength, your color, all those kinds of things.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:35):**  Then from there, it goes on a rail car and ships over to South Carolina, gets cleaned  in South Carolina.  Then from South Carolina in top form, then it goes to the spinner to be made into yarn  
**[0:21:45-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:45):**  in Kentucky or wherever it is.  And then once it's made into yarn, then the yarn has to get dyed.  And so then once it gets dyed, then it has to be woven into a fabric and the fabric has  
**[0:21:55-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:21:55):**  to be based on where it's going to sell into.  So then once it in there's different weavers and different styles of weaving, depending  on whether you're making a blanket or a hat or socks or what.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:22:07):**  And then from the weaver, then you have to go to a tailor to actually make it into whatever  it's going to be.  Then you have but you have to also have designers design what the end product is going to be.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:22:18):**  And it's just it's so complicated that supply chain before it actually ends up sitting in  a JC Penney's or I guess nothing sits in an Amazon warehouse.  Right.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:22:29):**  I was trying to keep count.  That's like a seven step process.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:22:33):**  And I think I'm leaving stuff out too.  It's really amazing how complicated that textile industry is, how what it takes to actually  make a sweater and it's the same for cotton and a lot of stuff.  
**[0:22:44-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:22:44):**  Wools a little more because it's kind of a unique fabric or unique.  So unique fabric, unique fiber, but it's really incredible the steps in between.  I would agree with you that cotton is probably pretty similar post harvest.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:23:01):**  But pre harvest, I think cotton is overshadowed by wool as far as an input cost and an efficiency  standpoint.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:23:13):**  Well, yes and no.  So one cool thing is so sheep don't just produce wool, they produce lamb too.  So you're able to have two sources of income sold in two separate markets for the same  
**[0:23:31-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:23:31):**  overhead costs of running a sheep.  Your only additional expense for the wool is your handling.  So your shearing expense is pretty much the only difference in that.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:23:43):**  If you went with haired sheep, so to say, instead of wool sheep.  If it costs you $5.30 to have one peeled, how much did the average fleece net you?  If you don't want to say the number, that's fine.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:23:59):**  Oh, it's fine.  It's a market.  So it fluctuates.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:24:03):**  This last year, we're sitting in probably around a $2.50 market for under 22 micron  clean US fleece.  And that's your margin after you pay the peeler?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:24:14):**  No, that's the gross.  So per pound, so $2.50 times nine pounds, that's $22 to $25 ahead on that.  We do get a premium in our program.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:24:27):**  But generally just open market, you know, $2.50 would be at a $25.  Easy math, just say you get 10 pounds of wool.  And so whatever the market is, it's just move the decimal.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:24:42):**  And that's kind of what I was doing is just okay, 10 pounds, $2.20 bucks, I get it.  So $15, that's not a bad margin.  Yeah, not too bad.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:24:52):**  And like I said, it's additional margin on the same fixed overhead.  So it's money you make on top of your work you've already been doing.  So if you don't peel them, you're just not going to receive that income.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:25:06):**  And from an animal health side, if you have wool sheep, you have to shear them.  I can't not shear them from my animal health.  Are they finding skilled labor?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:25:17):**  Yeah, labor in the sheep is in the sheep world is incredibly challenging.  The majority of the sheep herders in the US come through a work visa program called H2A  sheep herder work visa.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:25:32):**  And the reason isn't is specifically because of the skills it takes to be a sheep herder.  And this is why operation or ranch is different from the majority of the US and majority of  the US flocks are going to be herded, range herded on the mountain range in the in the  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:25:51):**  western United States.  So the Rocky Mountains slopes and those are all unfenced.  A guy has to live with those sheep through the summer and walk them around and make sure  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:00):**  they got water and stuff.  And so that skill set is very hard to get.  So the majority of those employees come through the H2A program.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:08):**  Some when you're on any kind of immigration program is that depending on the depending  on and this is not a statement one side or the other, depending on who gets elected president,  it changes.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:23):**  And it doesn't change.  Like there's no consistency between these and ours.  It's just whoever gets in changes the rules and then changes the rules again and then  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:30):**  changes it.  So every four years to eight years, your rules are getting changed.  And it's getting more expensive.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:36):**  And then the other problem we're having in in California is they they're reinterpreting  the rule to basically it's going to require a herder to be paid if they stay with their  interpretation that they have now that a H2A herder would basically be getting around one  
**[0:26:57-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:26:57):**  hundred and forty thousand dollars a year plus room and board.  And so you're looking at almost two hundred thousand in compensation annually for a sheepherder,  which is economically unsustainable because, you know, a thousand sheep is going to produce  
**[0:27:12-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:27:12):**  twelve hundred lambs.  You need to save 20 percent for replacement.  So that's eight hundred sellable lambs times two hundred dollars ahead.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:27:22):**  That's one hundred sixty thousand dollars a year in gross income for the herd of sheep.  And that one guy that's supposed to watch him on the mountains is going to be paid that  or more according to that interpretation.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:27:33):**  And so there's there's a lot of there's a lot of people smarter than me that know way  more about this issue than I do.  Yeah, that that would be once to talk about on it.  
**[0:27:44-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:27:44):**  But it it's definitely a huge concern for sheep and goat herders.  And also there's a lot of cow herders that come across through that same visa program.  And it's a California specific issue because it's a it's a California rule that AB 1066  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:00):**  I think that got passed.  And that's what's causing this.  Well, that's coming out of everybody deserves a living wage, right?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:06):**  Yeah, there's a living wage, but they can't square that argument when it comes down to  food, because our food systems.  They they just can't square that argument.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:19):**  Well, I mean, and you can I think I think you can make a huge argument that in the U.S.  we have we have benefited from cheap food for so long.  And but the but the margin when food goes up in the store, a lot of times that margin  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:33):**  doesn't end up at the farm gate.  It doesn't end up with the ranch.  I mean, look at the beef price.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:38):**  That's the greatest example of that over the last two years.  And the margin gets taken up in other spots.  It gets assumed in, you know, when you sell a wholesale product or a commodity, a commodity  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:49):**  product, you can't you're not you don't have the leverage to set price as well as service  industry or, you know, different layers in between.  So it's really.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:28:58):**  It's a huge challenge, and and I'm.  I I really so I have 20 guys that work with me and I really try to go above and beyond  to help them out with everything we can.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:29:13):**  We pay a fair wage.  We have higher wages than what our minimum wage is required and all those things.  We've always done that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:29:21):**  We actually we pay for the the we we pay to help get the guys green cards or permanent  residencies without any strings attached.  We you know, we always get complimented from our housing inspectors that our housing is  
**[0:29:35-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:29:35):**  is better than almost everybody in the state.  And so like I'm a big believer in this.  You know, we got to pay people what they're worth and what they're producing.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:29:45):**  But at the other side of it, at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, that just  doesn't work.  It flat out doesn't work.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:29:51):**  That would make you the lamb ranchers and the sheep ranchers just have to sell their  flocks.  And because it's you know, you have to you have to pay the people that grow your food  
**[0:30:03-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:03):**  or else you have to grow the food yourself.  And if you're not going to pay them enough to grow the food for you, you're not going  to have it.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:10):**  And so that's the crazy thing that's kind of happening is they're saying, well, you  need to cost you need to make it cost as much to grow my food for me and I'm not going to  pay anymore.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:20):**  And that's where the disconnect is.  And just kind of get what you're saying.  It's just.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:25):**  And then they say everybody deserves a living wage.  And then they then they'll turn.  Then you try to explain to them some of the economics of production.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:32):**  Yeah.  And they turn around and say, well, if your business can't afford to pay your people right,  why are you in business?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:39):**  Yeah.  As they're sitting there, you know.  Well, in the consequence of getting that equation wrong is we run out of food.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:49):**  That's a that's a question, like as it just says, is like to take this from the societal  standpoint, we can't get food production wrong in the U.S.  We can't get that question wrong.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:30:58):**  If we get it wrong, we go hungry.  You can't like you can't afford to be wrong on that one.  You got to pay your ranchers what they say they need to get or and if they don't produce  
**[0:31:08-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:08):**  the food, it's just not in the store or you're dependent on another country's food coming  in here.  We're so blessed in the U.S. with such a phenomenal ability to produce protein and fiber to the  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:21):**  world.  And we're able to export every year because of it.  But man, we got to get that right.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:27):**  And we got to, you know, I don't know.  I think it's really important.  I agree 100 percent.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:35):**  But I don't think that we're anywhere close to having it right.  I think we're moving in the opposite direction.  Well, there's this labor issue that I just brought up is 100 percent proof of that point.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:45):**  Yeah, we this is it's a ridiculous request that makes no sense.  And it's a request by somebody that thinks that they know better.  That doesn't.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:31:59):**  It's just never that doesn't have that doesn't have a dog in a fight.  Right.  It's not a stakeholder that's saying this.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:05):**  It's somebody outside saying you should do this without fully understanding what it is  that you do.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:13):**  Well, and I think a lot of it, too, at least when we talk to people in California, it's  oh, well, that's the rule that was passed.  So we've got to deal with it now.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:21):**  It just that is what it is.  And you try to articulate the argument and they'll agree with you.  But they're like, well, you know, it's a rule we pass.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:32):**  It has to be 1066.  It's the law.  And you got to do it.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:36):**  It's like, well, what?  Well, there's a process to change it if you want to fight it.  But for now, you got to go along with it and let the process.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:45):**  In state and federal law are in conflict on some of these interpretations, too.  So as a producer, you're forced to do you comply with the state law or the federal law?  And the answer from everybody is, oh, we'll talk to your attorney and make a decision.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:32:56):**  Well that I'm trying to run sheep.  I don't want to spend my days in an office with an attorney.  So it's just it's crazy.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:05):**  So yeah, you kind of uncovered the hot button issue in the sheep industry right now.  This is the one everybody's talking about.  What labor?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah, yeah, labor in this rule change and how it's going to affect everybody.  We've intentionally not had a topic on it on our podcast because it's so like up in  the air right now.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:27):**  Yeah.  And we get COVID warnings.  I don't care.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:31):**  Say whatever you want.  Yeah, oh, cool.  The same issue, though, when we tried to talk about the Colorado bill that tried to pass,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:42):**  no one would want to pause act.  Yeah, yeah.  No talk about it.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:45):**  They're like, we got one in the California Ag Committee right now, which would ban.  So first, I got to go back.  So the Biden administration because of the antitrust are issues with the beef industry.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:33:58):**  They I think they committed like a billion dollars to fund starting new packing houses  and new feed yards to help small businesses kind of to create some competition in that  arena.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:34:10):**  California has a law in the Ag Committee right now that would ban any new any new or expansions  on all feed lots and slaughterhouses in the state of California.  So while the federal government is trying to subsidize competition, state say no.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:34:31):**  It's crazy.  So why do they want to ban?  Why do they want to ban new feed lots and new packing plants in California?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:34:40):**  I I you know what, so I was born and raised in California.  I lived here.  I went to school in Oregon for a year and then Rome for four or five months.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:34:51):**  And then I ended up coming to California.  So I'm a Californian through and through.  And we have crazy politics.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:34:58):**  And if you spend your time trying to figure out why do they want to do this, man, you  just go crazy.  And so when you get like that, see, we're blessed with just this incredible weather.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:35:08):**  So when you get really frustrated, you just go outside, soak up some sunshine, do some  wakeboarding on the river, do some spear fishing in the ocean, go hang out with your sheep  on the hills.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:35:18):**  And it's all kind of okay.  But that's how we're able to put up with it.  No, it's a, you know, I don't want to speculate as to the why.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:35:27):**  I mean, there's a there's a lot of push to, to stop animal, you know, protein consumption  in the US as far as meat meat production.  I mean, I think it's kind of crazy.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:35:39):**  And that's a, all their arguments are totally flawed.  Like, oh, I don't even like getting cruelty.  It's cruelty, we need to stop this, we can just eat plant protein.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:35:49):**  Okay, where are we going to grow all that?  We're gonna get the fertilizer to grow all that.  I heard a talk from from Dr. Frank Mitler out of Davis.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:00):**  He's a greenhouse gas expert.  And he was, he said that he, he likes to quiz the vegans in his classes.  And he says, Alright, so what do you eat?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:09):**  All plants, right?  All plants?  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:12):**  All right.  Well, what do they do to how do they fertilize those plants?  Well, he's like, you know, compost or something like that.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:17):**  Where's the manure from that come from?  Oh, darn, it comes from animal production.  So you no matter what you try to do, you still are dependent on animal production, because  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:25):**  you got to have it.  So they get rid of animal food production.  You got no you got no manure waste.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:31):**  So you got no more compost, compostable manure, fertilizer to grow the plants that we need  to live on.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:40):**  So I came up with a very simple statement that can defeat almost any vegan argument  and just totally shut them down.  So shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:50):**  Yeah.  Okay.  If you're buying all your vegan food at the grocery store, I mean, you have no idea what  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:36:57):**  that crap is.  It's just labeled vegan and you want to buy it because it makes you feel good.  If you really want to be a vegan, and you're really committed to that lifestyle, try growing  
**[0:37:05-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:05):**  your own food.  Try growing enough of your own vegetables that you can feed yourself 365 days.  Or go to a farmer that does, then you will have my respect.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:18):**  Until then, all the vegans in the world can piss off.  Yeah, I agree.  It's amazing.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:24):**  It's that 365 day conundrum is what gets them.  Because people forget winter is winter.  And it's hard to, you know, hard to have food in winter.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:37):**  You got to figure out a way to have it.  Avocados don't grow in New York in February.  Last time I checked it.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:45):**  Yeah, they don't even grow in Rio Vista.  What does grow there?  Well, in my home garden, tomatoes and stone fruit and stuff like that does great.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:37:57):**  Cherries are good.  We're right in the California Delta and the Delta is just incredibly diverse in what it  produces.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:38:06):**  You can drive 10 miles from my house and you'll see everything from cherry orchards to alfalfa  fields to wheat fields to pear trees to almond trees.  You'll see blueberry patches, different strawberries.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:38:20):**  There's an incredible strawberry patch right next to Rio Vista across the river.  And then our Montezuma Hills.  It's mostly cereal grains in the dry ground, non irrigated ground, and then the sheep and  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:38:33):**  cattle and then up in Dixon.  Dixon's one of the top tomato, canned tomato producing.  A lot of sunflower seeds.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:38:41):**  There's not going to be a lot of sunflowers this year because most of those go to Ukraine  to get planted.  But a lot of sunflowers up there, walnuts, a lot of different crops all around.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:38:53):**  So it's pretty diverse.  That's the crazy thing in California is the diversity of crops that are grown.  I haven't spent much time in California, but the little bit of time I have, I appreciate  
**[0:39:05-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:39:05):**  it, drive by farmers markets in April when I was out there for grass fed exchange, CK.  Drove past a couple farm stands right off the highway and I'm like, well, that's cool.  And they had so many more things than we're going to find in a farm stand here.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:39:21):**  And honestly, where I am like roadside farm stands, they don't happen.  Got to get, oddly enough in Eastern Colorado where the population density is even lower.  There's just a couple of major highways that run through Eastern Colorado that go east  
**[0:39:37-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:39:37):**  west and one of them is highway 50.  And near the town of Rocky Ford, there's just produce stand after produce stand after produce  stand.  
**[0:39:48-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:39:48):**  It's kind of neat, but nowhere near the diversity of what you guys have out there in California.  The diversity and scale is unreal.  It really is amazing what the climate's able to produce out here and you're just able to  
**[0:40:01-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:40:01):**  do so much.  So that's a good segue into talking about what is your climate like?  Like how much rain do you get a year?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:40:11):**  Sure.  Our normal rainfall, and we stay pretty steady within this range year to year, but our normal  rainfall is about 16 to 19 inches, depending on what ranch you're standing on.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:40:24):**  And typically it varies three to four inches one way or the other.  Our rain is all in the winter.  So rainy season starts October and ends in May.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:40:36):**  Usually they have our local fair is the Dixon Mayfair and it's always Mother's Day weekend  and it always rains on the Mayfair and that's always when the rain's done.  So that's pretty typical.  
**[0:40:51-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:40:51):**  Last year though, we had the worst drought we've ever had.  My grandpa's 92 and he's never had any year like that in his history, but we got three  to five inches of rain on the whole ranch.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:02):**  And most of it came in really bad times and the soil moisture wasn't able to absorb it  very well.  And we just, we got hammered last year, but, and hammered worse than we've ever been.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:17):**  This year we're sitting at about 15 inches and you go 30 minutes north and they're droughted  out.  You go 30 minutes south, they're droughted out.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:24):**  You go 30 minutes east, they're droughted out, but we're in very good shape.  And it's, I don't know why, but it just worked out.  We worked out that way.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:33):**  And typically it does in our region.  We're kind of close enough in the Delta and close enough to the ocean that we always get  some moisture.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:40):**  That's good to hear.  You're like the first person I've talked to in the last two months that claims they've  had enough moisture.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:46):**  Yeah.  So I'm really nervous to say it loud, but we literally have the best feed year we've  ever had.  
**[0:41:51-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:41:51):**  I mean, it's just unbelievable how good the quality of feed is.  It's quality and volume.  And it's following on, I always have to tell everybody, cause everybody else is in such  
**[0:42:00-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:00):**  bad shape, but it's literally following by far the worst ever.  Like, I mean, this, it wasn't even close last year.  This year we have grass that's three to four feet tall.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:10):**  Last year, the same exact time we had nothing, they were walking on dirt and we were feeding  hay.  Some of the best grass that I've ever grown has been in a slightly below average rain  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:21):**  year following a severe drought.  Yeah.  So it comes down to that management, letting that, you know, making sure that grass has  
**[0:42:28-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:28):**  enough rests, you know, that, that rest period is adjusted appropriately for the conditions  you're experiencing and making sure that grass isn't grazed again before it's ready.  Really makes a difference.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:43):**  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, we really value, we rotationally graze our livestock all over and getting that rest  days right, even through the drought was really critical and helped us kind of get a good  
**[0:42:55-0:43:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:42:55):**  bump coming out of it.  And, you know, having de-stocked 20 and 30% of your cows, that helps rest days.  The easiest way to get more rest is the de-stock.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:07):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's also the most expensive, but it's a tough decision.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:12):**  Yeah, you got to do it.  That was a hard day watching those cows go, but we had, luckily we were able to get them  to another producer, so they stayed in the production chain.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:22):**  They didn't have to go to the butcher.  So many guys had to send them to the butcher.  And that's, that to me is still preferable than trying to feed anything through lack  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:31):**  of feed.  Yeah.  So, and we took kind of a both hand approach last year, so we definitely bought a lot of  
**[0:43:37-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:37):**  hay and we fed a lot through the drought.  But I mean, we literally had no feed.  It was, I can't even believe it happened.  
**[0:43:50-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:43:50):**  I guess it's kind of, I'm still in shock at how crazy it was, but I mean, I think we ended  up feeding close to three tons per cow on the cows that we had left.  And then all of a sudden, last fall, we got one day, we had 10 inches of rain on one day.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:44:06):**  Wow.  And all of the water soaked into the ground.  And then we never got any rain until like three weeks ago.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:44:13):**  And now it's just been like a half an inch every week.  And we just have this gorgeous feed.  It's been absolutely amazing the way the volume's down, but the weather just came perfectly.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:44:23):**  And that rain in the fall came early enough that we still had good daylight hours and  soil temperatures to grow all that burr clover and fillery that we make our living off of.  And then these spring rains brought the ryegrass on to where I had allergies for the first  
**[0:44:38-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:44:38):**  time in three years.  It really knocked me sideways.  So it's been, nature is amazing.  
**[0:44:48-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:44:48):**  It's so powerful and it's so strong and it's incredibly humbling working with livestock  and being dependent on the land.  I think that's why so many people that are 100% dependent on the land eat meat because  
**[0:45:03-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:45:03):**  they're realists on what it actually takes and the dependency on the system that we all  are.  It's just, yeah, pretty wild.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:45:18):**  Yeah, it's a very fragile system.  And there's some cracks showing.  And you mentioned earlier your marketing channels for your cattle.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:45:33):**  Are you concerned at all or moving towards trying to direct market anything or is that  any part of what you got going on?  Yeah, so we don't do any direct marketing.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:45:46):**  We have friends that do, we have neighbors that do.  I think you had Lauren Panch on.  We sell some heifers to him every year.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:45:58):**  We also sell him some lambs that are all grass fed all through our system.  He's one of those direct marketing success stories.  California has the market for it, but we've always felt, we feel we're grass managers  
**[0:46:18-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:46:18):**  first.  And so our first job, we're managing pastures and we're using the livestock to harvest that  feed rather than a diesel engine.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:46:26):**  Yep, on board with that 100%.  And so we're really focused on that.  And we really, we see a lot of value in being able to load a truck of animals and sell them  
**[0:46:37-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:46:37):**  and have them off.  We feel that's a very efficient way to produce beef and let somebody else finish the beef  as they need to.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:46:47):**  On the lamb side, we do it ourselves.  We finish our own lambs.  And like I said, we finish it both on grass and we have our feedlot.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:46:58):**  And it's anywhere from 20 to 40% of the lambs go to town off of grass.  But that's one thing about sheep, at least, and with seasonality of grasses and things,  you have only so many will finish in an appropriate range.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:47:16):**  And then you have to, when they're ready, you either have to ship them or you have to  freeze them after you sell them.  And that's very expensive and inefficient.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:47:28):**  And then you have an end that's never going to really finish unless you get a lot of age  on them, which is also very expensive.  And in lamb, once they get over 12 months, they're no longer lamb.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:47:36):**  They have to be sold as mutton or yearlings.  And so you have that time thing.  And so that's why we utilize that feedlot.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:47:44):**  We don't long feed anything.  So, longest days on feed and our feedlot will be 90 days max.  And we're trying to just feed to finish, not feed to grow.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:47:56):**  But can I ask what kind of ration you're feeding?  Like I'm not going to judge you if you're feeding a bunch of corn, I promise.  Oh, it is corn.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:06):**  I have no shame.  I told you everything's on.  Happy to talk about it all.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:11):**  So it's a corn ration, alfalfa, a trace mineral pellet and molasses.  It's basically all it is.  Pretty simple.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:20):**  Yep.  And it's 15 days to inverse from 75% alfalfa hay to 75% corn in 15 days is our transition  period.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:32):**  And then it's 45 days of corn.  And usually you get yield grade two to three on those lambs that won't finish on the grass.  How does that compare to the ones that do finish on grass?  
**[0:48:44-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:44):**  Product wise, I would say there's very little difference because the marbling, intermuscular  marbling and all that stuff.  Financially, it is way cheaper to finish off a grass.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:48:55):**  It is more financially beneficial for us to finish off a grass.  So we want to finish everything we can on grass.  And a lot of times people look at profits as a bad word.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:49:07):**  But if you really look at the economics of farming, that actually encourages you to do  best practices.  Oftentimes those best practices and profitability are linked together.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:49:23):**  There's always going to be exemptions.  But like I said, it costs us so much more to finish a lamb in the feedlot that we really  don't want to do it.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:49:29):**  Especially you're like this when corn is going crazy.  And we have a real risk of not even having a lot of feed available in California because  of the railcar backups and all those kind of things.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:49:43):**  So as far as direct marketing, we don't do any of that.  We're very close to the brand.  Superior Farms, we sell our lambs to.  
**[0:49:50-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:49:50):**  We work closely with them as far as what we're doing.  We market grass finished lambs if they're finished off the grass.  I think like 98% of our sheep are ABF antibiotic free because we don't once again, it's expensive  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:05):**  to use antibiotics.  We don't want to use antibiotics.  And if something needs it, we'll use it because I don't want to be 100% because I want to  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:12):**  keep things alive.  So if something needs antibiotics, I'm going to give it to them, just sell them through  a different channel.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:17):**  I do the same.  So yeah, I mean, we do that.  I love the developing direct markets, but we also think it's a very hyper competitive  
**[0:50:29-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:29):**  space in California.  And we don't have the personnel or overhead to commit to be able to compete correctly.  We'd rather sell to a company that can do it.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:37):**  So I'd rather sell to a Lauren Pancha and let him compete.  I'd rather sell to a Superior and let them compete.  Because once you start competing, you have to have salesmen, you have to have distributors,  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:46):**  you have to have product management.  I mean, it's almost a separate business on its own.  So we try to really focus on the farming and ranching.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:50:54):**  And as the volume that you're at, it probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  No, the most expensive thing we can do is sell 20 head a day, every day.  It's a lot easier to, like I said, send the trucks.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:51:10):**  So yeah, for sure.  To move the volume.  But that doesn't mean it won't change.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:51:17):**  You're speaking of rail car backup.  That reminded me, I saw an article just a few days ago that Union Pacific was saying  that there were some delays up to 60 days on their network.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:51:27):**  Oh, it's horrible.  So yeah, it's really bad.  Really, really bad right now.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:51:33):**  And so California uses 100% of its corn harvest in the first quarter after harvest.  And so that means that 75% of the year, all the corn used in California gets railed in.  Well, California is home to Foster Farms chickens and they have some ranch and Snake River and  
**[0:51:53-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:51:53):**  Snake River is up in Idaho.  But Harris Ranch, yeah, but I mean, the main ones of Foster Farms is the chicken production.  And we usually are able to buy truckloads, extra truckloads from them, they're bringing  
**[0:52:09-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:09):**  in.  We called them last week and we're like, Oh, we need some corn set up.  We don't have any.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:16):**  What?  Really?  None?  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:19):**  Yeah, we have none.  Oh my God.  Okay.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:22):**  All right.  Well, let's figure out how we're going to manage this because it's just there's just  not enough volume of rail cars coming through to haul enough corn in to satisfy that corn  
**[0:52:32-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:32):**  demand.  Competition for those car spaces is just through the roof for all sorts of other commodities  because of the 60 day backup.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:40):**  So you can order it and get it in in 90 days, 120 days, but if you need something now, thankfully  we have storage and we're in good shape, but still it was a shock.  I've never had that happen in my life.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:52:57):**  Before we jumped on the podcast, you were saying that you and your friends started yours  right after COVID.  It took CK a year to talk me into starting this one after COVID hit.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:53:09):**  I was a little bit slow, but I've been trying to warn people even since the very beginning  to plan ahead.  Plan ahead.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:53:21):**  These supply chain troubles that we've been seeing are going to continue.  So the things you know you're going to need for production in the next 6, 12 months, start  worrying about that now rather than when you normally would, which is 30 days before you  
**[0:53:38-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:53:38):**  needed it.  When I need something in a pickle, I call the best farmers in the area and almost all  of them have it on hand because they'll plan ahead.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:53:54):**  That's what makes them good.  That's so true.  I mean, even everything from scheduling your vet checks out ahead of time, scheduling your  
**[0:54:03-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:54:03):**  brand inspections before the day the brand inspection needs to happen, and then to the  larger extent, plan your budget a year ahead.  Have a five-year general budget that you have ideas on where you're going in the future.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:54:19):**  Really that planning, so much of my job when I started was working sheep.  It was in the field, in getting my hands dirty every single day.  So much of my job now is planning.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:54:33):**  What's happening next month, what's happening next year.  When you're making those decisions the day things are happening, that's when we're drowning.  The better you can do at planning ahead, putting your orders in ahead, making sure you have  
**[0:54:46-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:54:46):** ... I mean, just a dewormer, making sure you have your dewormers a month before you need  to put them in the animals.  Those kinds of things all... Yeah, 100% agree with that.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:54:56):**  That probably separates the better operators from the poor ones more than anything is that  planning ahead.  It takes capital, but it's important.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:05):**  Well, and to get the capital, you do some more planning.  Exactly, 100%.  Yeah, it all goes together.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:15):**  Let's talk a little bit about your cows.  Sure, sure.  I love my girls.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:20):**  You said you had your primary black Angus, but you also crossed in some wagyu.  Yeah, so our cow herd is 100% Angus.  We run two herds.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:30):**  We do the same on our sheep, but we have a terminal.  We call it a terminal herd and a maternal herd.  Our maternal herds are going to be Angus on Angus.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:39):**  The terminal herd are going to be Angus cows that get bred to Snake River Farms wagyu bulls  right now.  We do it that way, so that way if something happens with Snake River Farms, nothing's  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:52):**  going to.  We've been with them for like 15, 20 years, but if something ever did, we could change  overnight and breed those to whatever we wanted.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:55:59):**  We want to cross in Charley.  We want to do something else.  We can do it overnight.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:56:04):**  But the main thing we're doing is we take our better cows and we keep them in our maternal  line and then selectively breed based on what goals we have to that herd to then create.  And then anything that doesn't fit those parameters goes into that terminal herd that is really  
**[0:56:21-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:56:21):**  that productive engine for the ranch.  So we're kind of doing our own genetic push, but on a smaller scale of our cows and then  the rest of them are producing the income to allow us to do that.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:56:34):**  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:56:38):**  So what do you do with all your steers out of your maternal herd?  Right now we sell them as we just sell them on the Western Video Market sale once a year.  We keep them separate and just sell them to commercial feed yards as we need to.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:56:54):**  So tell me about one of your biggest wrecks and what it taught you.  Biggest wrecks.  You're going to get me back to the sheep now.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:57:06):**  Yeah.  Gosh, biggest wrecks.  You're going to make me consult my book.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:57:14):**  I got a book here somewhere.  There it is.  So I have a book that I've been writing down my worst disasters in ever.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:57:26):**  And I always try to take notes and remember what they are.  And one day the goal is to maybe auction it off when I'm like 97 to somebody out in the  middle of nowhere.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:57:40):**  But probably one of the biggest wrecks we ever had is we...  There's a few here.  But I think probably one was we bought in some lambs a couple years back and we had  
**[0:57:57-0:58:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:57:57):**  them, they started to break with coccidiosis symptoms.  And so we assumed it was coccidiosis.  We started to treat for coccidiosis.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:04):**  We did everything we could.  We gave vitamin to the sick ones.  We fed alfalfa hay.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:12):**  We put chorid in the water.  Everything we could.  We had to vet out multiple times.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:17):**  And then over a course of about...  It was probably two weeks by the time we took them.  And UC Davis is like 20 minutes away.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:29):**  So we're really big on getting necropsies and lab tests and stuff.  And we work very closely with their veterinarian.  And all of these book of recs have taught me that you really need a great relationship  
**[0:58:41-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:41):**  with a veterinarian to be successful.  But anyway, so we finally took the sample.  We had the samples finally come back and we tested for stuff.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:51):**  And yeah, there was coccidiosis present, but it wasn't large enough load to necessarily  kill the animal.  And so we weren't sure what exactly was doing it.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:58:58):**  We were finally able to isolate it to a copper deficiency in the sheep that came from the  source.  So it was a copper deficiency for their upbringing before we even had them on the farm.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:59:13):**  If you know anything about sheep, sheep are highly sensitive to copper.  And so most like you're not allowed to feed copper and sheep minerals for the most part.  You can't use molten metal on sheep.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:59:23):**  You can't do anything like that because everybody's worried about killing the sheep.  But to see that copper sensitivity expressed in such an extreme situation was really amazing.  It was frustrating because we had a wreck.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:59:43):**  But you know, you kind of I guess the thing I learned from it was, you know, you have  your institutional information.  But if I didn't have that relationship with that vet, and if I wasn't open to listening  
**[0:59:58-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=0:59:58):**  to different possibilities of things and figuring different deals out, we actually on those  sheep, we gave them all a, we gave them I won't say a dose because you're not supposed  to feed I don't want anybody getting ideas.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:00:10):**  But we gave them all a shot of molten metal under the directions of our vet.  And we cured it cured it overnight.  It was unbelievable how quickly that helped it.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:00:19):**  And exactly that's what it was, was that copper deficiency.  But you know, I've been told my whole life that you know, sheep are can't have any copper  and then here, no copper did a bigger problem than any copper I've ever given to anything  
**[1:00:34-1:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:00:34):**  over the history.  So they always be very attentive to every individual bunch of sheep and don't discount  any potential problems.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:00:42):**  They always be open to these new problems and learning constantly and trying to figure  out what's going on and gets back to that team of people you work with.  And you know, leaning on them really heavily.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:00:54):**  You got any good tips for building a good ranch team?  Veterinarian step one.  Yeah, I mean, seriously, I mean, and it's so hard in the further away from a population  
**[1:01:05-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:01:05):**  center it is the harder it is to build a good relationship with a vet.  But I mean, that just that he veterinarians go through so much schooling, they learn so  much and their expertise and the value they can bring to what you're doing extends so  
**[1:01:25-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:01:25):**  far beyond the break or a problem that happens on that ranch.  And so often vets only see the problems, they don't see the good sides of the ranch and  are able to give you advice to improve.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:01:38):**  So it's that those conversations, I mean, I have breeding heard, breeding discussions  with them on what bulls I should breed to the next year.  And those kinds of questions that, you know, wouldn't aren't really tied to like a health  
**[1:01:52-1:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:01:52):**  issue.  But he's out there enough, he knows his cat, he knows our cattle, he knows what my goals  are, he knows me as a person, and he's able to give me that third party advice from kind  
**[1:02:03-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:02:03):**  of an expert side.  The other thing is don't make decisions in silos, you know, make sure you're, you have  a team.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:02:11):**  So I always say start with a vet.  But the other side of it is find a neighbor that you respect that's in your area that's  been through some stuff, hopefully a little older than you and he lean on that trough  
**[1:02:22-1:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:02:22):**  of information and ask them questions and learn from them.  That was really helpful for me when I started growing up and then just make sure you engage  with people that aren't afraid to make mistakes, but learn from them when they do.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:02:38):**  You know, you gotta, as long as you're not making that same mistake twice, you're learning  and that's more valuable than getting everything perfect.  Because most of us won't get it perfect the first time.  
**[1:02:49-1:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:02:49):**  So really just having those conversations, building those relationships, try to find  people that see you and what you're trying to do from an understanding and want to help  you learn and you really try to bounce ideas off them.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:03):**  Don't be afraid to share your mistakes like you asked there.  I think, you know, being honest about your mistakes and wrecks when they happen are really,  that's where you learn the most.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:14):**  That's when you're really learning is when you're in the middle of a mess.  And that's not to say that you got to jump on a podcast and tell the whole world everything  you screwed up.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:27):**  It starts with being honest with yourself.  And if you can at least be honest with yourself, maybe you can be honest with a friend or a  therapist but you don't necessarily have to jump on a podcast and bare your soul to the  
**[1:03:40-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:40):**  whole world.  No, no.  And thankfully, there's guys like you that are doing it.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:45):**  So that helps.  That helps a lot of people.  It's amazing how many people, you know, really are producing these animals and they don't  
**[1:03:54-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:03:54):**  have places to turn.  They don't have people to lean on.  And I think it's kind of the other side of that.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:01):**  I benefited greatly from the people that were willing to share with me.  And so now that I've kind of cut my teeth a little bit, I don't know if I've ever told  anybody no, I'm not going to tell you something.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:13):**  I've always tried to help where I can with who I can because that's what got me to where  I'm at.  And if I can help someone else beat me and do even better than me and teach me something,  
**[1:04:26-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:26):**  I want that relationship.  That's how a healthy production system works is by everybody pushing each other to be better,  not trying to keep others down.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:37):**  You got to work, you know, whatever you call it, you got to work with everybody.  And that doesn't mean you don't have trade.  I mean, I'm not going to tell anybody my rents.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:46):**  I'm not going to keep things quiet on some stuff.  But at the same time, you know, you got to be willing to share, to learn a little bit  a lot of times.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:04:57):**  I agree with that.  And there's don't want to say, don't want to say, not going to say that.  You got me to say way more than I was thinking of saying.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:05:13):**  No I was just gonna say something about, never mind.  I couldn't figure out a way to say it that wouldn't be offensive to somebody that I don't  want to offend.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:05:29):**  And it's good to know that too.  When you're talking about sharing, you got to be respectful of people and adding, you  don't necessarily want to say something that you know somebody is going to take wrong the  
**[1:05:44-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:05:44):**  wrong way and that's going to hurt their production or their ability to be successful later on.  That's a very, that's a good thing.  That's a part of having good dialogue is understanding that question right there that you brought  
**[1:05:58-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:05:58):**  up.  So yeah.  And there's no reason to feel like anybody's in competition with anybody else at the sale  
**[1:06:05-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:05):**  barn or wherever you choose to sell your cattle.  And I guess one of the things I was going to say is just a few seconds ago when I was  tripping all over my words and myself.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:19):**  One of the things is that Dallas Mount says, yeah, you might be hitting the bullseye, but  are you aiming at the right target?  And that's really kind of relevant.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:33):**  The guys at the coffee shop here in the Midwest, topic of conversation in about 60, 70 days  is going to be, how's your wheat doing?  What's your wheat yield?  
**[1:06:44-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:44):**  What was the test weight?  And it's all a contest, right?  It's all a contest.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:51):**  Are we aiming at that?  Is that the right bullseye we should be aiming at?  Or should we be looking at something like how much do you increase your soil carbon  
**[1:06:59-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:06:59):**  this year?  What's your water infiltration rate?  Like those are the bragging rights I'd like to hear at the coffee shop.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:07:06):**  Well and you brought up, that's such a great point.  What are we doing in farming?  What's that goal?  
**[1:07:15-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:07:15):**  And we've narrowed it down to these base production numbers that are so easily swung to be able  to brag more.  So like in the sheep industry, it's lambing percentage.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:07:28):**  What's your lambing percentage?  I had 120% lamb crop use exposed to lambs weaned.  Well actually it was 114% use exposed to lamb sold.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:07:39):**  Well actually it was 150% use pregnancy scan pregnant to lambs born.  You could change that number based on whatever you want, but at the end of the day, it doesn't  really matter.  
**[1:07:52-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:07:52):**  It's just a bragging right number.  But then you mentioned like what's the soil carbon capture of this ranch on this year?  That's a number that measures sustainability of your place over a period of time.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:06):**  That means you're going to be a business next year.  That's way more important than my fictitious...  Yeah, that's like, it's really...  
**[1:08:15-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:15):**  And we have the tools to start measuring some of that stuff now that they didn't in the  past, but kind of like those numbers that help you measure the sustainability of your  ranch, the ability for you to be around for generations, those kinds of numbers, those  
**[1:08:32-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:32):**  are the valuable ones.  I mean, you can get a higher yield by dumping more in the ground.  Get some commercial nitrogen out there and I can go ahead and make that grass grow a  
**[1:08:42-1:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:42):**  little quicker.  Is that going to help me next year?  You can make any money?  
**[1:08:47-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:47):**  Yeah.  And just like with cows, you can feed condition and fertility into anything.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:08:55):**  Well, and I can buy in twice the hay that I should just so that way I can say I got  1000 cows instead of the 872 that I should be having on the ranch.  You know, you can mess those numbers up a lot.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:07):**  So yeah, being able to measure those kinds of things like soil carbon, how many pounds  per acre did you produce on the grass that you grew only?  Those kind of numbers, those are valuable.  
**[1:09:20-1:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:20):**  That's where profitability and sustainability really reside.  How many pounds of protein did you grow per acre?  How many pounds of protein?  
**[1:09:30-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:30):**  Wool.  And wool.  I'll admit I've got a really banging pair of wool socks that they're like my favorite  
**[1:09:40-1:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:40):**  socks ever.  Yeah.  Haven't seen them come around to laundry for a while, but yeah, wool socks.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:46):**  I'm on board.  They're pretty sweet.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:49):**  But no, that's a yeah.  So I actually haven't mentioned.  So one thing we did do as part of our wool marketing is we developed a carbon farm plan  
**[1:09:59-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:09:59):**  on a ranch.  And so we actually measure that.  And then we look at the different practices and we're trying to increase that number every  
**[1:10:06-1:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:06):**  year.  But that kind of stuff I think is really important.  And I think more ranches, if more ranches pursued it, they'd realize that there is,  
**[1:10:20-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:20):**  it gets back to that economics being linked to profitability, that operating with these  kind of ideas in mind actually leads to better economics on the ranch.  It leads to lower hay inputs, lower feed, feeding hay.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:41):**  Feed less hay.  But it really does help a lot of that stuff.  And so paying attention to it's really important.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:49):**  Yeah.  Bed feed costs.  It's one of the top two profit killers in ranching.  
**[1:10:56-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:56):**  Yeah.  Hands down.  Absolutely.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:10:59):**  And it does.  It's fed feed costs.  It's the cost in the feed and it's the cost in the time it takes to take that feed, put  
**[1:11:07-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:07):**  it in a bale, move it from the stack to the yard, into the barn, and then from the barn  onto a truck, and then from the truck into the field and then dumping it from the truck  into that cow's mouth.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:17):**  Yeah.  I just, that's so expensive.  So something, Ryan, that Brian and I talk about all the time is you really should start  
**[1:11:25-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:25):**  measuring production in energy units.  What's the energy to do this whole process?  Because people are counting for the labor or any fuel costs usually.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:40):**  Like how many BTUs of fuel did I burn to move all that hay?  Energy unit.  Yeah.  
**[1:11:45-1:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:45):**  That's a good point.  I actually, so I went to lunch with my grandpa today and he asked me if I was going to put  up any hay this year.  
**[1:11:51-1:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:51):**  And I told him no.  The reason I told him no is because I didn't want to run tractors over all the ground and  lay it down and then run them again and put them in a bale and then run the trucks to  
**[1:11:59-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:11:59):**  move the bales into the barn.  I'd rather leave it in the field, let it rot.  We'll lose a little bit into the soil, but it's going to make a healthier pasture and  
**[1:12:08-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:08):**  a cheaper operation because it's so darn expensive to put up right now.  You can come back through and graze that matured grass crop at high densities and what they  don't eat, they're going to tromp into the ground.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:19):**  Yeah.  That's exactly what we do.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:22):**  You're giving it to the soil.  You're not losing it.  So, yeah.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:25):**  No, not at all.  I mean, it's, yeah, it's utilized in different ways.  So yeah.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:31):**  So we've talked about sustainable, that word's come up and there's problems.  I try to avoid it because it's so cliche.  There's problems with it.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:43):**  What's sustainable?  I've been in business.  We've been on the same ranch since the 1870s.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:47):**  That's pretty sustainable, right?  Yeah.  It's like, whoa.  
**[1:12:50-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:12:50):**  Yeah.  But if we're happy with sustainable, that means that we're not interested in changing  because this current state is okay and it can go on for a while.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:04):**  And I think that we can all agree that that's not the reality.  The reality is we've got to do more than that.  We've got to regenerate.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:13):**  We've got to make things better.  We've got to start taking steps, not just to sustain where we're at, but to make things  better.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:21):**  Yeah.  I'd say it a little differently.  Agree with you a hundred percent.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:28):**  I would probably say it more that, I mean, one of the mantras we have is we can always  do better.  We can always improve.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:35):**  And so, yes, I jokingly say, yeah, we're a sustainable ranch.  We've been around for 150 years, pretty sustainable, but we're sustainable because we're always  trying to be better.  
**[1:13:46-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:13:46):**  We're always trying to do it better.  We're trying to figure out a way to make that healthier soil to produce more feed, to be  able to harvest through the animals in a better way.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:14:02):**  We're always trying to drive to that better solution.  And yet that sustainable definitely implies just keep it the same.  But you got to be driving to be better.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:14:13):**  And that's better in the right ways.  It gets back to that, what's your wheat yield versus what's your pounds produced per acre  divided by the inputs, your energy input.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:14:32):**  What's your carbon?  What's your water infiltration?  We're going to come up with a pretty complicated algorithm that everybody can use in the country  
**[1:14:37-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:14:37):**  here by the end of this podcast.  But I think that's really, really a key insight to successful agriculture over the long term,  especially in the US because it's been so easy for so long to mine the ground, but we're  
**[1:14:57-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:14:57):**  running out of elements to mine and we need to start rebuilding it and figuring out a  way to keep it around for a longer period of time.  Because otherwise, two more generations, we're not going to have the soil carbon to grow  
**[1:15:12-1:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:15:12):**  enough grass, to grow enough corn to ship to California to feed my sheep.  It's really, yeah.  Okay.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:15:24):**  I was going to say I was going to go back down the whole corn road again, but we'll  detour.  Yeah, go down it if you want.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:15:34):**  Well, how sustainable do you really think that is?  That you have to import a very significant amount of the corn you need to feed your sheep,  that you have to bring that across the Rocky Mountains?  
**[1:15:44-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:15:44):**  I think that it is unsustainable, but I also think it is a good product right now today  and it works in today's system because the systems don't change every night.  They change over time.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:16:01):**  The other problem is we can't grow enough here in California.  The California Delta right next to us used to be all corn.  Now it's 10 to 20% corn.  
**[1:16:17-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:16:17):**  Now it's growing pears and all these other different crops.  It was the problem.  It's the problem, the corn being railed to California, the only sustainability problem  
**[1:16:31-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:16:31):**  because it's actually a result of an improvement in ag diversity system locally.  It's one of those things that have to work out over time to correct.  We could feed wheat.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:16:43):**  We could switch to another grain.  The Montezuma Hills grows a lot of grain.  Most of it's not food quality.  
**[1:16:49-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:16:49):**  Most of it's low in protein, so it'd be more feed grain.  Once again, you're fighting against Foster Farms for that demand on the feed grain.  That's in the dairy.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:17:02):**  In California, dairy is a huge consumer of these protein products or energy products  and energy not in gas, energy as in corn, carbohydrate.  I don't think it's sustainable forever, but right now in our current economic state, that's  
**[1:17:23-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:17:23):**  the best product that we have to be as sustainable as we can be.  That doesn't mean that I shouldn't look for new ways.  I want to look for new ways.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:17:32):**  I'd love to see new ways.  One of the downsides or I don't know what the way to say that is.  One of the difficulties is we believe in a very simple system and we want to keep it  
**[1:17:45-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:17:45):**  as simple as possible and make a simple change and change.  We don't want to be trying all of these things every year for 10 years and we got a different  ration every six months.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:17:54):**  We want to make sure that when we find something different, we change it.  That makes total sense because when you do a ration change like that, your genetics are  going to take a while to catch up to be able to perform the same.  
**[1:18:12-1:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:18:12):**  Well, it's not so much performance based as I'd be worried about animal health things  going wrong.  When you change rations, you change the animals, what they do.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:18:25):**  You have people that are watching those animals and those people have to learn the change  and learn to look for new things at different periods of time and being able to react quickly.  Whenever you make a change, you have to learn from that change and usually you learn by  
**[1:18:38-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:18:38):**  having something happen.  I don't want those things to happen because I love my sheep.  I want my sheep to thrive.  
**[1:18:44-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:18:44):**  I want them to be as happy and healthy and strong as possible.  I feel like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth because I really believe in this.  I don't know what you call it, this focus on soil health that's starting to grow in  
**[1:19:03-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:19:03):**  all of our livestock production industries because it's one of these things that people  need to pay attention to.  We can't ignore it anymore.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:19:14):**  No, but it has to be solved locally because all of our systems are so different that the  answers on my place are going to be different than the answers on my neighbor, different  than Lauren's answers, different from your answers.  
**[1:19:28-1:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:19:28):**  We got to be sharing within each other because we'll learn something but at the same time,  we all got to make these changes differently.  You're dealing with these large industries and large things change slow and that's the  
**[1:19:42-1:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:19:42):**  biggest problem.  The crazy thing too is you have these brands that are pushing for products that want to  be sold under the labels.  
**[1:19:53-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:19:53):**  Like a regenerative or a slow health or an environmental label, a green line.  Thank you.  They want to be under that but then they cut corners and they cheat.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:20:07):**  It's so frustrating.  You have somebody out there that's actually doing the practice, trying to sell that product  for what it costs them to produce and then you have another person come in there that  
**[1:20:20-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:20:20):**  doesn't do any of them and they undercut the price and they sell it at a point that it's  so much harder to actually produce at that regenerative level, so to say.  They undercut our ability to transition to what it actually does.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:20:38):**  I think the customer would pay if they understood but so many of them don't understand because  they're just getting inundated with sales pitches all day on Instagram.  That's about all Instagram is these days it seemed like, is sales pitches.  
**[1:20:52-1:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:20:52):**  I'm about done with it.  I don't log in a whole lot there anymore.  I guess every once in a while I'll pitch an episode on there but if you're one of my Instagram  
**[1:21:04-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:04):**  fans and you want me to be more active, let me know.  I don't really like Instagram that much anymore.  It's all Facebook now.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:15):**  It's a lot of fun to go argue with people.  Yeah, I'm Catholic.  I gave up all social media for Lent.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:25):**  So I've been in paradise here for the last 40 days.  It's been great.  I'm not sure I have the strength or discipline to give it up.  
**[1:21:35-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:35):**  I just read a newspaper this morning.  It was fantastic.  They still have those?  
**[1:21:41-1:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:41):**  Yeah.  Heck yeah.  A few of them.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:44):**  I'm not sure if there's any.  I know we have newspapers.  My county, we still print a newspaper once a week.  
**[1:21:52-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:52):**  Yeah.  On delivery.  I get the Monday news sometimes on Tuesday.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:21:56):**  Definitely on Wednesday.  Yeah.  I mean, I love going down these crazy rabbit holes but I think one of the problems we have  
**[1:22:07-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:22:07):**  is before the Instagram, Facebook, all that kind of stuff, people got their news from  the coffee shop.  They'd go to the coffee shop and they'd talk to individual persons and those individual  
**[1:22:19-1:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:22:19):**  persons all had experiences and you liked them or you didn't like them or you trusted  them or you didn't trust them but then you filtered that information and that became  your kind of world view.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:22:30):**  Well now everybody pops up that screen and their worldview is just completely shaped  by that scroll and then they go and they talk to those same guys in the coffee shop and  they don't even know who they are and they talk right over each other and they don't  
**[1:22:45-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:22:45):**  have conversations and they're not digesting for themselves what's happened and they're  just kind of regurgitating this thread that has just turned their mind to mush.  It's pretty amazing the difference in the way information is set through our country  
**[1:23:04-1:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:23:04):**  nowadays.  The speed at which a concept can get to the vast amount of people that it can, that's  what blows my mind now.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:23:20):**  I talked a little bit about the marketing or branding of stuff but if people could actually  talk to farmers about regenerative agriculture or in carbon soil and what that actually looks  like on these different places, the more they're able to actually engage with the farmer, they're  
**[1:23:42-1:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:23:42):**  usually blown away by who they are and it's not small farmers versus big farmers or anything  like that.  It's just they're just people and you have farmers that are doing a bad job and you have  
**[1:23:55-1:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:23:55):**  farmers that are doing a good job.  I try to get out there and try to tell somebody, so many people already have their mind made  up before they even talk to a farmer and so then they'll pretend like, well, you're not  
**[1:24:07-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:24:07):**  even a farmer or you're a corporate or you're too big.  I hope people can start to trust that these conversations are happening within agriculture  and there is growing momentum within agriculture and not 100% of any one person's idea is  
**[1:24:25-1:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:24:25):**  going to be what it's going to be but people are starting to pay attention to this because  like you said, we're running out of time to where we're not going to be able to keep pushing  the envelope with synthetic fertilizers and things like that.  
**[1:24:40-1:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:24:40):**  We have to come up with better ways to be sustainable for the next 100 years.  I hope people can start trusting that these conversations are happening and they're not  going to change overnight like everybody demands.  
**[1:24:55-1:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:24:55):**  They're going to change over decades because it takes time.  I don't know how long does it take to build an inch of soil, new soil?  Isn't it like 150 years or something?  
**[1:25:07-1:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:25:07):**  We're never going to reach soil carbon saturation in our lifetime.  Like I said, the question all the time is it takes thousands of years to get back to  what we've depleted.  
**[1:25:20-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:25:20):**  I don't think it's so much like actually rebuilding the soil.  It's like, A, we got to stop the bleeding.  We got to stop the wind and the water erosion and then we got to let the microorganisms  
**[1:25:31-1:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:25:31):**  and the nematodes and then the fungi, we've got to let them do their thing and build their  community.  It's not that we can't do it.  
**[1:25:45-1:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:25:45):**  It's just we lack the will on the large scale, I think.  I think that there's a lot of temptation to sell a product rather than produce what is  supposed to be produced.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:01):**  There's a lot of false narratives that get promoted that undercut agriculture's ability  to actually invest in that.  You can't buy soil health in a box at Tractor Supply.  
**[1:26:14-1:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:14):**  No, you can't.  Exactly.  Among other things, you cannot buy a box of fire.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:21):**  You can buy a box that contains devices that generate fire, but you don't buy a box of  fire.  You can't buy a box of soil health.  
**[1:26:30-1:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:30):**  I feel like the farther you go down the regenerative rabbit trail, you're looking at less input,  growing everything you need on your farm.  Well, who are the vendors you're going to be relying on?  
**[1:26:45-1:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:45):**  There's not many.  Those are the people that if we're in any other industry would be trying to sponsor  this show.  
**[1:26:57-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:26:57):**  The people that have all the money are the ones promoting the use antibiotics, the fertilizers,  the pesticides, the herbicides, the neonicotinoids, the patented seeds.  The people telling us, hey, there's a better way, are the people not dependent on any of  
**[1:27:14-1:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:27:14):**  that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:27:17-1:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:27:17):**  And yeah, it's hard to not pay attention to all of the advertising that you're getting.  It's hard to ignore the salesmen.  It's hard to ignore the fertilizer salesmen, hard to ignore that constant drum beat.  
**[1:27:34-1:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:27:34):**  I got a problem with already choked thistle.  Well, the easiest solution is to disc it and nuke it, disc it and nuke it again, grow some  crops and then go back to pasture.  
**[1:27:46-1:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:27:46):**  But no, I got to find another way.  And it's hard to find that other way.  And I might not be successful, but it's hard to ignore all those calls and those temptations  
**[1:27:58-1:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:27:58):**  and that push.  And yeah, because there's a lot of money behind it.  I talked about there how economic sustainability is tied to longevity of the ranch.  
**[1:28:11-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:28:11):**  I really do believe that's true, but you have to make long-term decisions.  If you try to make these short-term decisions, you end up really hurting yourselves in the  long run.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:28:25):**  And a lot of that gets down to getting long-term leases.  That's trust over time with your relationships on people you're working with.  There's so many layers to that.  
**[1:28:35-1:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:28:35):**  And that's why it has to be locally solved.  There's not going to be one thing that works for everybody.  It's going to be a lot of different people doing a lot of creative things over time.  
**[1:28:47-1:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:28:47):**  And if you can have that long-term goal in mind and work towards it over time, you will  be more sustainable and you will be more profitable.  But it takes time and it's hard because you break and change path halfway through, you'll  
**[1:29:00-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:00):**  say, oh, I didn't make any money and now I'm fine.  Well, you're fine for a few years, but you really need to start focusing on your long-term  goals.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:08):**  When it takes time from a lot of these larger landholder agencies, they need to be willing  to actually invest time in their tenants and put up the capital so that way tenants can  actually put things in that are better for the rotation of livestock on their properties.  
**[1:29:28-1:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:28):**  There's so many of these big leases that they put all the fence repairs and water trough  repairs and everything on the tenant.  Well, that just encourages the tenant not to do anything.  
**[1:29:37-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:37):**  They just load it up with stock or cattle, burn it for three years and then leave a desolate  barren place.  Sounds familiar.  
**[1:29:44-1:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:44):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's so true.  But these are in California, these are environmental organizations that are putting these short-term  
**[1:29:55-1:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:29:55):**  leases together or they'll do like a one-year trial within a potential for maybe something  else later.  Well, they're not given any incentive for the farmer to actually invest their time and  
**[1:30:06-1:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:30:06):**  expertise into the property.  It takes time, like 10 years, 20 years to change something.  And how do you build trust overnight when they're going to just flip employees and pull  
**[1:30:20-1:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:30:20):**  the lease out from under you in two years?  Just yeah, it's a challenge.  Difficult situation to try to build trust in with an organization like that, that's  
**[1:30:33-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:30:33):**  most likely been traditionally adversarial towards ranchers and agriculture in general.  Yep.  I can definitely see that.  
**[1:30:44-1:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:30:44):**  So you've been talking about your irrigation.  And at the beginning we mentioned Oroville Dam and that whole situation, which I watched  that whole situation with extreme interest because I'm kind of an engineering nerd.  
**[1:31:01-1:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:31:01):**  And that was just, it was really incredible to see like how that all unfolded, how they  fixed it, and now how they've analyzed it and understood how it all happened.  Anyway, that's not where I want to go.  
**[1:31:17-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:31:17):**  Irrigation water, like how dependent are you on irrigation and how has that been performing  for you over the years?  And are you worried that that might come to an end?  
**[1:31:31-1:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:31:31):**  There's a lot there.  First I got a buddy who was, he works for an explosives company and he was on the Oroville  job.  
**[1:31:41-1:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:31:41):**  And he said there was places where it was less than an inch thick in that dam.  I mean, it was so close to going.  And I mean, there's a couple million people that live underneath that thing.  
**[1:31:54-1:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:31:54):**  And there would have been a 40, 50 foot wall of water going down on Marysville and some  of these towns.  And I still can't believe that that held and I mean, I truly think it was an act of  
**[1:32:03-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:03):**  God to keep it up there.  I got tuned in to that on the Blanco Lirio channel, which I'm probably sure you're  familiar with that guy.  
**[1:32:13-1:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:13):**  He's from that area and he made a lot of videos of the dam.  Like he was doing almost daily updates for a while.  He's got an airplane he'd fly by, aerial shots.  
**[1:32:21-1:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:21):**  Yeah.  He's an airline pilot.  I mean, pretty sharp guy.  
**[1:32:25-1:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:25):**  Anyway, so I was tuned into that like from the original, like when they discovered the  original cracks and that primary spillway started to fail.  And then when it started to go over the emergency spillway, that's about right when I started  
**[1:32:38-1:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:38):**  to tune in.  I was like, oh, water over emergency spillway.  That's never good.  
**[1:32:43-1:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:43):**  Oh, tallest dam in the country.  That's really bad.  And yeah, that was sucked in after that.  
**[1:32:50-1:33:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:32:50):**  Oh, man, that was unreal.  So irrigation water, we have yes, we are dependent on irrigation.  We're dependent on irrigation because we're very seasonal in our grasslands in California.  
**[1:33:04-1:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:33:04):**  So like I said, the rain is in the winter, our grass grows from, you know, grows in the  fall when we get fall rains, stops growing in December, January, February starts growing  in March and grows until about May 1st of June and then it dies out.  
**[1:33:18-1:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:33:18):**  In order for us to have high quality feed to deliver grass fat animals over the summertime,  we need to have irrigated pasture in order to do it.  So it's very important for us and we're very dependent on it.  
**[1:33:34-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:33:34):**  All of our irrigation water comes from the Sacramento River Delta.  We have three, we have different ranches and different water districts.  Well, so we have two water districts.  
**[1:33:46-1:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:33:46):**  All of it is pumped out of the river.  All of the water districts are worked off, are built off of a kind of a recycle recapture.  So the top branch uses the water, the drain goes in and that drain water goes and feeds  
**[1:34:02-1:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:34:02):**  water to the next ranch and the next ranch and the next ranch.  So it's an enclosed system, so to say, where the water gets pumped once and then gravity  fed through all of the ranches until it goes to the river.  
**[1:34:15-1:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:34:15):**  We do have one ranch that is a, I think it's like a 1898 riparian right, functions the  same way except we have a drain pump in the end of the drain that then pulls it back up  and puts it back into the head ditch.  
**[1:34:29-1:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:34:29):**  So when we put that in, we were using about six acre feet per acre on that ranch of fresh  water out of the river getting pumped into the ranch.  When we put in that return system, we went down to where we only need to pump about two  
**[1:34:43-1:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:34:43):**  and a half to three acre feet per acre.  So we cut our water demand in half from the Delta.  Water rights in California are incredibly complicated, challenging.  
**[1:34:56-1:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:34:56):**  They're always in court.  They're always getting pushed back and forth.  We have layered rights in all of our areas and I can get into that if you want.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:05):**  You could probably start a podcast on just taking apart California water rights.  I don't know how long you have.  So most people would just turn it off because they're not in California.  
**[1:35:17-1:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:17):**  It's really complicated, but there is a lot of water in California.  So that's the thing I guess to start with.  There's a lot of water in California.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:28):**  We have very good growing season, combination of lots of water and growing season is why  we have such diversity in our production over here.  Yeah.  
**[1:35:37-1:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:37):**  So.  We're able to ship it around quite a bit.  Oh, everything is flood irrigated.  
**[1:35:42-1:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:42):**  So because we take our drains and recycle them and use them again, everything is going  to be flood irrigated and then brought back up.  We also test the water going off the ranch to make sure we're not putting any pollutants  
**[1:35:58-1:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:35:58):**  in.  Yeah.  Awesome.  
**[1:36:01-1:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:01):**  Awesome.  Well, you're about ready to get out of here?  I don't know how long we've been going.  
**[1:36:09-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:09):**  This is quite a while.  Well over an hour and a half.  Oh, that's pretty solid.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:13):**  That went quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:36:16-1:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:16):**  All right.  So even though you're taking a social media break from Lent, it'll be, I don't know where  my sheet went.  
**[1:36:23-1:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:23):**  It'll be a while before this one comes out.  Lent's over tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  
**[1:36:26-1:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:26):**  Oh yeah.  Saturday.  Saturday at 7.30.  
**[1:36:29-1:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:29):**  Time to party.  So now everybody knows when it was recording.  7.30 PM.  
**[1:36:32-1:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:32):**  Yeah.  No, sundown on Saturday.  Okay.  
**[1:36:35-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:35):**  I was asking my husband about that.  I was like, we're very bad.  Yeah, that's all good.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:41):**  Yeah.  But yeah, no, so I'll be back on social media and all that stuff.  All right.  
**[1:36:50-1:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:50):**  I'm trying to publish this.  Yeah.  So other than your Sheep Stuff You Should Know podcast, where else should I send traffic  
**[1:36:55-1:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:36:55):**  to in my show notes?  You can send traffic, all hate mail, whatever you want.  It goes to at California Sheep Rancher on the Instagram.  
**[1:37:07-1:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:07):**  And yeah, I got to say thank you for having me on.  And one thing I've always believed in and I really appreciate is just having good conversations  about issues and things.  
**[1:37:19-1:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:19):**  And so, if somebody has a question or doesn't like something I said, don't feel bad about  asking me and thinking you're going to say it in a mean way.  I'm happy to answer questions.  
**[1:37:31-1:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:31):**  I'm happy to have conversations and I'm happy to be challenged on my thoughts because I  know I don't have everything right right now.  And I love learning.  
**[1:37:40-1:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:40):**  Commitment to be a lifelong learner.  I think that's why we're in regenerative ag because we're still learning about things  and we haven't just decided that the crop consultant and the seed salesman know everything.  
**[1:37:49-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:49):**  Because we can always do it better.  No matter where we're at, we can do it better.  So yeah, for sure.  
**[1:37:55-1:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:37:55):**  Well, I think that's a great place to end.  Ryan, thanks for joining us today.  It's been absolutely awesome.  
**[1:38:03-1:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:38:03):**  Thank you.  Gosh, I really appreciate being on.  This has been fun.  
**[1:38:06-1:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/62-Ryan-Mahoney-Sheepenomics-e1hu8ja#t=1:38:06):**  Yep.  All right, gang.  Have a great week.

**[0:00:32-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:00:32):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher back for another weekly episode of Ranching Reboot.  Riding with me as always is my wonderful and lovely co-pilot and navigator on this journey,  C.K.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:00:54):**  Vishnushki.  I got it right this time.  And today we're joined by Daniga Marca Gard from Marca Gard Family Grass-fed Beef out  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:01:05):**  in California.  So let's just go ahead and roll right into it.  How are things out in California for you?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:01:12):**  Oh gosh, well, it's beautiful and green now.  But not for long.  We were in a major drought.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:01:22):**  It's really dry.  And you know what, we can't complain.  We're out ranching in t-shirts along the Pacific Ocean and it's beautiful and we're managing.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:01:36):**  So we're resilient.  So tell our listeners where you're at.  Well, we are coastal hills.  
**[0:01:47-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:01:47):**  The grassland is coastal terrace prairie and both north and south of San Francisco Bay  Area.  So our operation spans three counties, San Mateo, Sonoma and Marin counties.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:02:04):**  Okay.  And so tell me about your land base.  That's probably not all deeded owned land, is it?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:02:12):**  No.  So we started transitioning my husband's cow calf operation about 16 years ago.  And at the time he was managing large ranches for Neil Young, the musician.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:02:31):**  And prior to that, his dad had managed for Neil Young and also Peter Folger from Folger's  Coffee who was sort of the cattle baron in the San Francisco Bay Area.  A lot of people don't think cattle in San Francisco, but there's actually a lot of really  
**[0:02:56-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:02:56):**  nice, beautiful coastal hills and really prime for raising cattle.  And we found for grass fed beef with the coastal environment and the Mediterranean climate,  we can keep our animals out at pasture year round.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:03:15):**  And so, yeah, about 16 years ago when my husband and I met, I sort of had brought a background  of wildlife ecology and nature.  And I just sort of said, hey, let's direct market grass fed beef.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:03:34):**  There's no reason why you should be selling your calves to the auction to be finished  in a feedlot eventually when there's a growing demand for direct market, healthy nutrient  dense foods.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:03:53):**  And he said, yeah, let's do it.  I don't have any skills to direct market meat, but let's go for it.  So we've never turned back.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:04:04):**  And so, at that time he was managing ranches, but also leasing some for his own cattle.  And then we grew from leasing a thousand acres to now 11,000 acres.  And we don't own that ranch land.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:04:24):**  We lease all of it.  Well, great.  We'd like to hear a little bit more of your story about how you got started and started  
**[0:04:32-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:04:32):**  to develop contacts and a land base and built a business to where you're at today.  The audience we're really trying to reach, and I think we're kind of getting there,  is we're trying to reach those people that are in the dense urban areas that over the  
**[0:04:45-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:04:45):**  last year, year and a half, have really started to question where their food is coming from  and wanting to be a part of that.  So can you maybe walk us through some of that?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:04:57):**  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, we're kind of in a prime area for having great relationships with a consumer  base that is very educated, wants to know that the decisions they're making by feeding  
**[0:05:20-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:05:20):**  themselves and their families are not only helping their own health, but helping the  environment that the animals are treated well.  So we're sort of in a prime market for direct marketing, grass fed beef.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:05:36):**  And so we really look at that we're all eaters and we're all sort of in this together.  And it takes everyone.  It takes a village to really support healthy, healthy lands, healthy watersheds.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:05:56):**  So some of these friends, I don't really separate them from us.  It's like we're not the farmers and they're the consumers.  It's more like we're just in this relationship together and we really depend on each other.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:06:14):**  So I've sort of shifted the way we think about like, oh, we're not just selling a product  and trying to get these consumers to purchase something.  It's like, no, they're sort of partners in this with us.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:06:30):**  And that kind of goes back to where we started, which was we started just selling shares of  an animal.  So you had to really buy in and commit.  
**[0:06:43-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:06:43):**  And now we've of course, we've shifted as we've grown larger and are those those eaters  that we're in relationship with have really shifted as well.  It seems like the more we are doing this, the younger they the younger and more affluent  
**[0:07:07-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:07:07):**  they are getting, especially in this area.  So when we first got into it, it was mostly older moms wanting to feed their families  like kind of from the Weston A. Price tradition.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:07:23):**  And now we're just seeing a lot of millennials that are working in tech that are saying,  hey, this is this is my connection to nature and this is my connection and way to sort  of give give back.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:07:38):**  It's almost like they're they're wanting to source directly from the farmer or rancher,  because it's not just to feed themselves, but it's also they're part of a larger movement  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:07:55):**  And it's an it's a whole experience.  And they we have this membership program that we we just launched during covid because we  just got overwhelmed.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:08:11):**  Oh, yeah.  With orders.  And so we we've we kind of took a step back and said, hey, you know, we've been doing  
**[0:08:18-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:08:18):**  this for a long time and we have really dedicated people that have stuck with us.  So and they also want to see us thrive.  So we started this whole new membership, which has been great for us and great for being  
**[0:08:38-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:08:38):**  able to prioritize those people that are really committed to sourcing from us.  So, yeah.  No, you're muted.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:08:52):**  I am muted.  Sometimes I do that to myself.  So I'm interested in in in that marketing, the membership.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:08:59):**  How does that work?  Yeah, so, you know, it's we've we've gone through a whole gamut of different sort of  CSA is so, you know, I in my teenage years, my summers, you know, some of my summer jobs  
**[0:09:17-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:09:17):**  are what I would do part time was work at the organic farm up the road.  I grew up in the Pacific Northwest in Washington state and where the organic farming movement  was really thriving in the gosh, I guess this would be in the in back in back in the 90s.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:09:39):**  And so, you know, we're really sort of ahead of the curve for a lot of the rest of the  country.  So I learned about that model of community supported agriculture and really, really believe  
**[0:09:53-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:09:53):**  strongly in that.  So when we we've we've gone through many different, you know, renditions of that community supported  agriculture and really we've kind of landed at what you know, what are people what are  
**[0:10:12-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:10:12):**  people used to doing now that.  You sort of locks them in to something and and really works for the business model that  we're in.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:10:28):**  So what we've done is we're actually selling subscription membership.  So much like if you were to download an app on wellness or meditation, you pay ten dollars  a month and you get access to certain things.  
**[0:10:48-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:10:48):**  So we charge a fee, a yearly subscription fee.  And what that gives people is they get first pick at everything that comes back from the  butcher.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:11:01):**  We we send them sort of regular updates.  We we keep them involved, like through storytelling.  So you kind of like I don't do we don't do a lot of we don't spend a lot of time and  
**[0:11:16-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:11:16):**  energy on marketing, but we do love to tell our story.  We've never paid for an ad, but we we we love to bring people out to the ranch, have them  sort of verify what they're buying first person.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:11:35):**  And we also love to tell our stories in many different forms.  So we send them regular updates, kind of give them the inside scoop on what's going on on  the ranch.  
**[0:11:46-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:11:46):**  And then they they get members only sales and pricing on certain things.  And we raise like the best pasture raised chicken in the whole area that people just  I mean, they love it.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:12:02):**  And but we only raise a limited amount.  So only members have access to that chicken.  So it's sort of like you get access for that.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:12:14):**  You you're sort of more part of the family.  And it's a great way for us because it helps us to cover sort of those upfront costs early  in the season of all of the processing and all of that.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:12:29):**  So so I'm really happy with it.  You know, in that whole process, we did a whole overhaul of our online Web shop and  customized it so that we weren't paying a chunk, a percentage to Squarespace or, you  
**[0:12:47-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:12:47):**  know, a Shopify would be a similar thing.  But we actually were retaining that percentage and only paying the credit card fee, which  which ends up being a lot if you're doing it through online outlets.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:13:02):**  A 3% adds up real fast.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  So we have a great, great Web Web designer that just said, hey, I'll do this and I'll  
**[0:13:13-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:13:13):**  customize it exactly how you want it.  So again, a long time customer, you know, customer friend of ours who's been buying  from us for for years and years.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:13:24):**  So there's there's always people in the community to step up when you know, when you need help  with certain things or to shift your business model or, you know, really evolve, because  that's what we've found is what worked when we started 16 years ago.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:13:41):**  You know, it was not the same people that we're in relationship with now than we were  16 years ago.  Yes, there's a small percentage that, you know, still have stuck with us.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:13:55):**  But overall, human behavior shifts, and a lot of that has to do with the you know, the  way that people view the world, the way that people view what they value, and also what  they their behavior gets accustomed to.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:14:19):**  And it was sort of like I thought online, you know, online web shops for a long time.  And it's like, well, you know what, even if we don't, though we don't ship and we still  don't ship, people are accustomed to shopping online.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:14:34):**  So if a rancher doesn't have an online presence and an online shop, you're really going to  miss out on connecting to the people that are going to purchase from you.  And that's really what it's about for us is connecting.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:14:53):**  And if that connection comes through an online shop, and beautiful pictures, because our  shop is, you know, representative of who we are and our family, then that's really we  really need to meet people where they're, you know, what they're used to doing and their  
**[0:15:13-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:15:13):**  comfort zone and what their behavior is in in the present moment.  And it, you know, it's  someone that's used to go into the grocery store, and looking at a cut of meat in the  
**[0:15:24-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:15:24):**  meat case, is not going to want to come to the not going to want to come to the farm  and watch that animal get harvest on farm and broken up into, you know, brown paper  wrap packages that they can take home.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:15:36):**  Yeah.  So I, I'm getting the idea.  I wrote down a question and I think you actually turned it completely around.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:15:45):**  I said, the question was, is how does your marketing tell the story of your outstanding  stewardship?  But I'm getting the idea that for the last 15 years, you've just been telling the story  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:15:56):**  of your outstanding stewardship and the market has come to you.  Right.  That's amazing.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:16:03):**  Is that kind of is that how you feel about it?  Yeah, I mean, people have told me, wow, Donica, you're you're really great marketers.  Like, I don't have a clue about marketing.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:16:16):**  I know, I've never put any attention or anything towards like I said, we've never put an ad  in the, you know, online or in the paper or anything like that.  We've never quote unquote, advertised our business.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:16:35):**  We've always just done what we've done, told our story.  You know, our ranch days pre-Covid were so popular.  People would just flock to come and have an authentic experience connecting with their  
**[0:16:53-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:16:53):**  their food.  So so, yeah, really what it what it's about for us is regenerative agriculture is is really  not just about sort of the grass fed beef as a byproduct of land stewardship and providing  
**[0:17:12-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:17:12):**  healthy habitat for billions of life forms from grassland birds to predators to, you  know, healthy riparian areas to microbes in the soil.  So that's really where where our passion lies is seeing this the life on these prairie ecosystems  
**[0:17:36-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:17:36):**  that we steward really thriving.  And and, you know, besides the sort of the eaters that we're in relationship with, we  also are in relationship with a lot of scientists and groups like the Audubon Society and soil  
**[0:17:58-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:17:58):**  scientists and people that are really measuring these impacts so that, you know, they can  also help to tell our story.  We like Audubon.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:18:11):**  We like the Audubon Bird Friendly Beef Program.  Yeah, that was great.  It's good stuff.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:18:20):**  So I'd like to hear some more about the ranch days that you had pre-COVID.  And we're also going to circle back because, you know, and talk about your land base some  more and how you manage.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:18:30):**  But so let's talk about some of your ranch days.  Yeah, so being that we are right over the hill from Silicon Valley and we have sort  of a very large population base to draw from, our ranch days got to the point where we had  
**[0:18:51-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:18:51):**  to cap them at 100 people and we had to add in multiple tours during the day to where  we would get like 300 to 400 people with four different tours moving through the ranch on  a single ranch day.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:19:11):**  And we would do these every month.  It was sort of all that we could possibly manage.  And so and sometimes we had to turn people away because it was just too many.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:19:27):**  So it would just, you know, families would come out.  They would, you know, we would offer them an opportunity to give a donation, which most  people did.  
**[0:19:41-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:19:41):**  And we would bring them around and just show them the animals and how they were raised.  And, you know, we would show them how we move the chickens every day and show them the baby  piglets and let them feed the pigs and, you know, walk them out to the cattle.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:20:01):**  And when we had a couple of family milk cows, we would, you know, let them pet the milk  cows and take pictures with the cows.  And everybody just they just loved it and they loved learning.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:20:14):**  They loved sort of hearing positive stories.  You know, I never wanted to focus on all of the challenges of agriculture, but more the  beauty and the hope and sort of the lifestyle of it, like that we get we are really blessed  
**[0:20:38-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:20:38):**  to be able to work outside every day and work with our children.  So it's like if there was ever a question about like the challenge, you know, somebody  from the audience asked a question about the challenges.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:20:53):**  And if I started to dive in further, then sometimes we would get complaints like, you  know, they didn't want to hear that, you know, they didn't want to get that on a nice Sunday  afternoon when they were out with their kids.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:21:07):**  I mean, some people really did, but it was like, you know, let's table that conversation  for a one on one thing.  So I you know, I learned through giving these tours time and time again to really focus  
**[0:21:23-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:21:23):**  on that emotional hook of, you know, the potential and the beauty and just some of the results  that we're seeing on the ground with the wildlife and the birds and the soil.  And so people left, you know, feeling really good.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:21:45):**  And then they purchase a lot of meat at the end of the tour or they'd sign up for the  membership.  And, you know, I still hear people today is like, I know I signed up for your membership  
**[0:21:58-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:21:58):**  and I come and purchase from you at the farmer's market every week because I went to a ranch  tour and it changed my life.  And, you know, my kids still say that, you know, that's that was the best day of their  
**[0:22:09-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:22:09):**  life when they went on the ranch.  And it's like, oh, gosh, I feel kind of bad for the parents that say, you know, it was  like it wasn't Disneyland or the expensive vacation that was the best day of the kids  
**[0:22:28-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:22:28):**  life.  And then driving a half an hour and, you know, going to pet a milk cow and and run around  and seeing the animals that sustain us.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:22:38):**  But it's such a foreign thing to them.  Right.  So it's such a novel, like now they're connected to their food.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:22:44):**  So that impact is huge that they actually know where it's been raised, how it's been  raised by who.  And they know that they're contributing to their local community.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  What's that thing I always say?  Oh, yeah, shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:23:01):**  And I think that's, you know, that's a pretty, pretty important thing that, you know, you're  doing that I'm really trying to do is directly connect the producer with the consumer and  cut out all those middlemen because I kind of had a conversation with a friend of mine  
**[0:23:17-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:23:17):**  the other day.  You know, when you have a big faceless corporation, that's that's basically kind of strip mining  wealth and exporting it overseas.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:23:27):**  Okay they'll recall a half a million pounds of meat pay a fine.  And yeah, that's national news for a couple days because they made a couple people sick.  But you make somebody sick, like that could really shut your business down.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:23:40):**  And you know, why don't we have better productions as producers when we're trying to do things  as good as we can.  Anyway, like, we'll lighten it back up.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:23:53):**  You've been talking about your membership.  So where can people go to find out more information about that before we get too much further  down the rabbit hole?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:24:02):**  Oh, yeah, just marky guard family.com.  M A R K E G A R D family.com.  Okay.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:24:11):**  And yeah, currently we have currently we have a waitlist.  So you know, you got to kind of join the waitlist and we'll let you know when we open it back  up again.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:24:24):**  It might be about to get a little bit longer.  So obviously you have cows you've talked about, you mentioned that you have chickens and pigs.  Do you have any other species out there that you graze with?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:24:36):**  Yeah, we do grass fed sheep as well.  And grass fed lamb, our flock of sheep is currently working, they're put to work on  an organic farm down the road.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:24:52):**  And so they graze the cover crop and the farmer is on a sort of rotation with his crop.  So he'll put a certain section of his farmland into pasture for the year just to fertilize  the soil.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:25:12):**  So that's been a great partnership that we can get the sheep off of our grass and grazing  his lush, beautiful cover crops and they can get fat and he can get the fertility.  So you know, there's no money exchanged or anything like that.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:25:30):**  It's just a great partnership relationship that you know, another relationship that we  have with another local farmer.  You know, you've got a land base that you can use and he's getting the benefit of  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:25:43):**  the fertility and you're saving your grass for your cows.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yep.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:25:51):**  Yeah.  So that farm is called Blue House Farm.  They also sell at a lot of the same farmers markets that we sell at.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:25:58):**  I think that's really, I think that's kind of an important point that you don't have  to do all of it yourself.  You can work with partners like that to a mutually beneficial arrangement and not be  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:26:11):**  in competition.  Yep.  So, you said your kids were involved.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:26:18):**  Let's talk about your kids.  Yeah, yeah.  So we have four kids and you know, the youngest is 11 and the oldest is 19.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:26:32):**  And yeah, like just yesterday, they were all on horseback helping us sort of do a difficult  cattle move through rough terrain.  And you know, we had to say, okay, you got to watch out because you know, these ravines  
**[0:26:47-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:26:47):**  are going to come right up on you.  And so, you know, you got to be paying attention and you got to be in tune with your horse.  And so, you know, it's really cool to watch them work and watch them be independent because  
**[0:27:01-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:27:01):**  it used to be like, okay, you know, you know, much more of a challenge to get them to be  able to, I mean, you know, they're managing their horses and cattle and difficult terrain  and brush and sometimes having to hop off and hop on.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:27:19):**  So it's nice that they can all just do that.  And we can trust that they're going to do a good job and they're going to be safe.  And so, yeah, I mean, they're all great.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:27:30):**  They all do a lot with horses and, you know, they've ridden bareback, you know, when they  were little a lot and they also do this sport called horse vaulting.  So they're really in tune with the animal, which is amazing to watch that and how that  
**[0:27:54-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:27:54):**  sort of how they're in tune with their body and the rhythm of the horse and, you know,  their strength and their balance and how that sport has really helped them on the ranch.  It's like, I mean, they love the sport and they're really competitive, but it's also  
**[0:28:13-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:28:13):**  sort of been great training, like Rancher Bootcamp that, you know, especially in COVID,  they they've really trained hard with their their horse vaulting.  And I mean, it's it's incredible how strong they are and how in tune to their bodies and  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:28:32):**  just in the moment, because that's what you need when you're out there.  When you're working cattle in a corral, it's like you need people to be on it.  Right.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:28:41):**  I mean, to be able to read the body language of the animals and, you know, to to be on  their horse and predict where where the cattle are going to be and where they're going to  move.  
**[0:28:52-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:28:52):**  And so, yeah, it's really fun working with the kids.  And I'm just looking forward to summer and we won't have to work around their school  schedule.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:29:05):**  I'm already like putting things on the calendar like, OK, well, let's see their office school  this week.  So the following week, they're going to go up to Jenner with us and camp out because  
**[0:29:17-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:29:17):**  we need to work all the cattle and we need those extra hands.  So just kind of counting the days till they're they're out of school.  Are they doing the opposite of a lot of?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:29:29):**  And they're like, oh, God, when summer going to be over, I need my kids out of here and  back to school.  Are they doing in homeschool or are they doing it in class school now or they're a high  
**[0:29:42-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:29:42):**  they're hybrid hybrid.  Yeah, since we're sort of a anomaly in the area, we've we've gotten away with them.  We were in a real kind of a small small town school.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:29:57):**  A lot of their classmates are children of farm workers.  So we're really involved with the community and the school.  And they've worked with us in a great way, like been flexible with us.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:12):**  Like if we need like, OK, we need some workers today.  We got a difficult, difficult cattle move or we got to work cattle.  And so, you know, they've been really the school's been really understanding.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:23):**  And we also do some of our own homeschooling independent study as well.  They're all in they're all in nature school.  So and they have always been in since they can walk.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:35):**  I love that.  Yeah.  And then another really key part to our family and our business is the grounding in nature.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:42):**  Yeah, I saw I think I follow you on Instagram.  So I saw that one of your sons is doing an enterprise.  Is he still doing that with the duck eggs so that you can buy a truck?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:53):**  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:30:56):**  Ducks for ducks for trucks.  Well, this this is a kind of a cute little funny story.  Like he's he's the entrepreneur.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:31:05):**  Like he loves to start things.  And like, you know, he probably started that business when he was 10, 11 or something.  But, you know, I would look around.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:31:17):**  It's like, oh, where's Larry?  And you know, the constant joke is like, oh, he's out ducking.  Like he just loved to go out with his ducks and like build stuff and build shelters and  
**[0:31:28-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:31:28):**  build like, you know, all these.  He created this whole watering system and, you know, was doing a bunch of research online  of, you know, different ways to water his ducks so that he didn't have water and, you  
**[0:31:42-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:31:42):**  know, using power, you know, power tools.  And so he loved to do, you know, ducking, which is just kind of building and and creating  things.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:31:52):**  But when it came to washing eggs every day and putting them in cartons and making sure  they were ready for market, it was like he was not into that.  So finally we said, OK, Larry, you got to sell your business because you're not maintaining.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:07):**  I mean, you're really good at starting it, but you're not you're not maintaining it.  So so he didn't complain because he was kind of over the daily and daily chores.  So so he sold it to his sisters for like two.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:22):**  How funny.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:25):**  But he's still I mean, he's a worker.  And he's probably well on his way to to putting, you know, to having a good savings for for  his truck here in a couple of years.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:40):**  That's amazing.  Yeah.  So.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:43):**  Shift gears a little bit.  One of the questions I've always had ever since I ever since the kind of the first time  I visited California, which is a couple of years ago for Grass Fed Exchange, is, you  
**[0:32:56-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:32:56):**  know, I saw the roads you got.  You'll have to deal with.  Out here, we use spread axle, 53 foot cattle pots on long wheelbase, stretched out Peter  
**[0:33:05-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:33:05):**  Belts when we got to move cattle long distance.  How in the heck do you get cattle on and off some of those smaller and some of those ranches  that basically have a two lane road hacked off the side of a mountain that you can barely  
**[0:33:20-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:33:20):**  get down in a pickup, much less with anything more than about a 10 foot trailer?  Yeah, it's true.  Well, we we don't we don't raise stalkers.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:33:31):**  I mean, we have stalkers, but they're all our own stalkers.  So we are we're unique in that way.  I don't think there's a whole lot of operations that are have every class of livestock because  
**[0:33:46-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:33:46):**  it's not the most profitable way.  But that's not why we got into this business.  And so we have the cows, we have the calves and we raise the stalkers and we finish them  
**[0:34:01-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:34:01):**  on the range.  So pretty much each ranch has its own family group and the cows live there and we only  haul off what we harvest.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:34:15):**  So the animals, for the most part, unless we need to, you know, destalk or pull, you  know, we don't have enough land or pasture to raise the heifers in a separate separate  group when the bulls are in.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:34:31):**  They pretty much are resident herds.  So then other than that, it's all gooseneck.  We gooseneck everything out.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:34:41):**  So did I hear that right, that you run your yearland replacement heifers with the cows?  Yeah, yeah, we run family groups.  So like there'll be a cow with calf on her side, a yearling on her side and a two year  
**[0:34:55-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:34:55):**  old on her side.  I mean, they're not nursing on her, but they're there.  They kind of have their own little family group like the, you know, when we even when  
**[0:35:04-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:35:04):**  we're finished, we're finished on the range and like they stick together.  So the cow, you know, the last year's last year's calf just kind of hangs out with the  mom and her new calf.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:35:17):**  I say, oh, yeah, there's the little family group there.  So they're there with, you know, like we're going up together on a ranch that we lease  up in Sonoma County.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:35:29):**  And yeah, the road is a one lane road.  It is so steep and really sketchy.  And we're pulling off 30 month old steers that that'll be their first time in a trailer.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:35:47):**  And so they were they were born there.  And that'll be the first time that they leave is they'll leave there, take a three hour  drive to the slaughterhouse.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:35:58):**  And that's it.  So they had a they had a good life.  And I went to Joel Saladin say they have good life and one bad day.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:36:05):**  And I think that that should be our goal as as livestock producers and husband, husband,  livestock husbandry.  That should be our goal is that animal needs to have exactly one bad day in its whole life.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:36:24):**  And you know, we're all active a little bit on social media.  And I got to tell this little story kind of bothered me.  And it'll be it's going to be about the end of May when this comes out.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:36:35):**  We're recording it kind of kind of at the beginning.  And last week I worked calves.  And we did a rope and drag in the corrals and we used a couple sets of Nord forks.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:36:46):**  I think, you know, pretty much everybody by now knows what those are.  And I put it on I put it on TikTok actually.  And for two days, it didn't get any views.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:36:59):**  And this morning I went to look at it.  Your video has been removed for community guidelines.  Like all I was shown is we're dragging a cat dragging a couple calves, putting the forks  
**[0:37:11-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:11):**  on, giving the two vaccines a brand and cutting the bulls.  That's it.  I mean, to us, that's like, that's just everyday stuff.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:20):**  Well, to animal rights activists, I could see how they'd all that calf is screaming.  They're killing it.  They're killing it.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:26):**  Oh, they're throwing that metal behind its head and stretching it.  Oh, that's not good.  Well, I think we can all agree that when you take a newborn baby to the doctor for the  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:35):**  first visit, no matter what you do, they're going to scream.  You know, those first shots, the circumcision, if it's a boy, you know, they're going  to scream.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:42):**  But it's necessary because we want to set them up for success later in life.  And I think that's something that people need to understand is yeah, there's things  that might not look the best on camera or might not appear the best to an outside observer.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:37:58):**  But just take a minute and let's explain what we're doing and why we do it that way.  And I think, you know, having ranch days really helps.  I'm not in a population dense area.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:38:07):**  So, for me to get 100 people out here for a ranch tour would be just incredible.  Of course, I say that now and next weekend, they'll be here or something.  So a couple other questions about, you know, some of these ranches like you're talking  
**[0:38:25-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:38:25):**  about that place in Sonoma County with a narrow steep road.  What if you lost that lease?  What if they just called you up tomorrow and said, we're pulling your lease, you got  
**[0:38:34-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:38:34):**  to get your cows out of here?  Would you have to take everything out of there and 26 foot goosenecks?  26, 20, yeah, more like 24.  
**[0:38:45-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:38:45):**  That's all that will fit up there.  And yeah, yeah, basically, we would we'd have to haul them down to a central, you know,  we'd have to borrow a neighbor's facility and semi load them out probably from there.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:04):**  Well, did you have to do something like that with the fires?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we've evacuated with the fires.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:13):**  And yeah, it was all goosenecks.  Yeah.  Do you want to talk about that?  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:18):**  Or is that still a little fresh and raw?  Your experience with fire last year?  It's your guys' podcast.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:25):**  Let's talk about your experience with fire.  And like, let's talk about let's talk about wildfire experience.  I mean, I've dealt with it before.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:33):**  It's no fun.  You know, especially trying to get livestock out and away.  So talk about that, Brian.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:41):**  So what was that?  Was it 2016?  Yeah, it was 2016.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:46):**  So we had a wildfire come through here in 2016.  But it got started on a Tuesday afternoon.  And it made it almost 30 miles that Tuesday.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:39:59):**  Our fire department, our local rural fire department backfired off a highway and stopped  it for about eight hours.  But the next morning, the wind came up and switched and blew, you know, 30 miles of fire  
**[0:40:09-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:40:09):**  line, blew that straight out to the east.  And things got ugly in a hurry.  My 7,000 acre ranch probably took less than an hour, hour and a half to burn up completely.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:40:21):**  And there were places that I had, you know, four or 5,000 pounds of the acre of stockpiled  grass.  It went across and it just ripped through there and completely smoked all the trees.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:40:35):**  The worst thing for me was I didn't have any, I was still 100% custom grazing operation  at the time.  So I didn't have any stock on the place.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:40:43):**  But they're coming in a month, they're supposed to be coming in a month.  So I had to rebuild a lot of fence in a hurry.  I had to replace almost all of my electric fence cable that year.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:40:54):**  So I graze with a lot of electric fence.  That's how I, you know, rotate around.  I'd like to hear about how you guys rotate your cattle on your different properties.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:41:03):**  But I use a lot of electric fence and I've started to use a lot of poly wire and that  stuff doesn't really, doesn't survive fire very well.  So what have been some of your experiences?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:41:14):**  Yeah, so, you know, we've been sort of watching from a distance over the last several years  as other farmers and ranchers have had to evacuate and working to sort of support them  from a distance and like kind of seeing what they've gone through, like, oh my gosh.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:41:39):**  And so finally in 2020, it was our turn.  And we, you know, I always sort of felt like, because a lot of the big fires were more inland  and I felt like, oh, we're coastal, we're a little bit more resilient.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:41:56):**  You know, our forests are redwoods.  So, you know, they're more resilient to wildfire and we get the coastal fog.  So we've got more moisture.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:42:05):**  Well, that wasn't the case with the August lightning complex.  It was just widespread and impacted our ranches down here in San Mateo County and also our  ranch up in Sonoma County.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:42:22):**  We were, you know, basically on wildfire watch and we lost a personal property that we have  in the Santa Cruz Mountains and we evacuated over 300 head of cattle to our home place,  which was just outside of the evacuation zone.  
**[0:42:44-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:42:44):**  So at least, you know, at least that was good that we had, we're able to have all of our  cattle or all the evacuated cattle here at our home place.  You know, we were hauling in water, obviously feeding them a lot until we could safely bring  
**[0:43:01-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:43:01):**  them back.  So, so, yeah, I mean, it's a reality.  And unfortunately there's, you know, we don't see much of a solution for this because it's  
**[0:43:17-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:43:17):**  just been decades of non, basically non-existent management of our forests and grasslands for  the most part.  And a lot of that has to do with all the public lands we have around here.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:43:35):**  So we're sort of surrounded by a lot of state parks, a lot of regional parks, and these  government organizations move very slow and they put a lot of time and money into reports  and consultations and bringing the experts out to tell them what should be done.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:43:57):**  And then there's public meetings.  Because you're not the expert, right?  It's almost an insult, right?  
**[0:44:04-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:44:04):**  Oh, it's absolutely a slap in the face.  So yeah, it's very challenging, you know, dealing with these large government groups  that basically are like in action, like do not, they do not take action.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:44:28):**  They write reports and then maybe eventually when it's too late, they'll get the funding  to actually do some forest management and get grazing animals on their land, maybe a  very small percentage.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:44:43):**  Do you feel like the way that you rotationally graze kind of helped with this situation?  Actually with the wildfire though, like you could have been worse.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:44:55):**  I mean, we definitely could have been way worse.  You know, we did have a fire the previous year come on to our ranch from a neighboring  place that started on a neighboring place that was full of brush and was not grazed.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:45:12):**  And then as soon as it hit the grasslands, it slowed down and CAL FIRE was able to cut  a fuel brake.  A fuel line, yeah.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:45:22):**  Yeah.  So yeah, I mean, grazing is like the sort of number one tool for preventing out of control  wildfires and it needs to happen on a much broader scale than it is right now.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:45:39):**  The unfortunate part is that a lot of the land at one time was viable grazing operations.  And you can see that sort of the fence posts barely hanging on and just strands of wire  here and there.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:45:57):**  So you know that at one point it was in grazing, but it has been 15, 20, 25 years, 30 years  since cattle have been on these lands that the amount of money that it would take to  get these places back into operation and the hoops that you would have to jump through,  
**[0:46:20-0:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:46:20):**  you know, the barriers are too, they're perceived to be too big.  Yet, you know, the amount of money spent on cleanup after a fire, you would spend a fraction  of that on fencing and water development and working with ranchers who really need the  
**[0:46:43-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:46:43):**  grass.  And by grazing and managing those forests, I'm not even gonna say properly, but just  a half a step better than where we are would provide so much more clean, holistically raised  
**[0:46:56-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:46:56):**  meat.  I don't think that any of us can really wrap our heads around it.  Well, and other ecosystem services like a better watershed improvement and wildlife,  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:06):**  the microbes.  Improving habitat for beavers.  Audubon Society is more, what is it, birds?  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:14):**  You can't fool the birds.  You can't fool the birds.  I'll always tell you if you're not doing a good job.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:19):**  So if we can, can we like backtrack a little bit and talk some more about recovery after  a fire and any changes you had to make to how you graze that property after it was all  burnt?  
**[0:47:34-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:34):**  We actually didn't have our property burnt in our grassland, burned in 2020.  It came right up to the border and then they were able to hold it back.  So it came very close, close enough to the point where we'd had to evacuate, but we  
**[0:47:51-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:51):**  didn't have any of our grassland burnt, fortunately.  Okay.  Well, I guess we can just skip that whole line of questioning.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:47:59):**  Well, what did you do, Brian?  You just had to fix fencing real quick and...  Other than fixing fence, you know, it's just, it's a waiting game.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:48:08):**  It's, it's Sundays and it's moisture.  You know, you're waiting to get enough sunshine to warm the soil up and you're waiting to  get enough moisture to start growing some plants.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:48:19):**  Then you got to be careful about, you know, what you do grow and not grazing it too hard,  too fast after a fire.  So you know, when you start getting that regrowth, it's every day, every other day at fairly  
**[0:48:35-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:48:35):**  light stock density, just to keep them from overgrazing certain plants and keeping them  moving and letting that grass get a lot of recovery.  But we also got to say this, you know, the high dry plains is a totally different ranching  
**[0:48:48-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:48:48):**  environment than the coastal, what would you call it?  Coastal Hills, coastal Canyons of California.  You know, we can have some, some really, really super deep soils, you know, four or five,  
**[0:48:59-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:48:59):**  six feet deep, or we can build a lot of root mass and you guys don't have that out there  on the West coast.  It's like, you know, it's an inch or two kind of on solid rock.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:49:09):**  Am I right?  It depends.  But you know, the, and there's also a lot different, you know, temperature and humidity  
**[0:49:19-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:49:19):**  cycle and you have the cool air coming off the Pacific, you know, the cool moist airways  coming off the Pacific ocean with a lot of humidity on it.  And a really long growing season.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:49:32):**  We can have pretty decent growing season here if we get good rain and early, early sun and  it kind of carries over late, but yeah.  So what are some of the resources in schools that you've been to that have helped you along  
**[0:49:50-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:49:50):**  in your ranching education that have taught you these regenerative principles?  Yeah, I would say first and foremost was, um, my time, um, immersing in nature at the  wilderness awareness school.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:50:06):**  Uh, so I was, uh, and I talk about this in my book, uh, Dawn, again, tracking the wisdom  of the wild.  It's my first book.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:50:15):**  Um, and, uh, it, you know, really where I tell people they need to start is by learning  how nature functions and immersing yourself in the patterns of nature.  So I, um, it, through my youth, I was, um, uh, mentored in wilderness survival, indigenous  
**[0:50:36-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:50:36):**  knowledge and bird language and wildlife tracking.  And so I think that, um, if you have a grounding in, in nature, um, and kind of put yourself  out there and wilderness survival is one of the best ways to do it because you, you really  
**[0:50:56-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:50:56):**  are sort of surrendering and understanding like how you're really dependent and on every,  you know, the plants and the animals and the water.  And it's a way to sort of heighten your awareness and your instincts.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:51:14):**  Um, and it really, the requires you to immerse in your senses and another great way is to  track predators, track large predators, like sort of be on the trail of a predator because  when you track a predator, then you're trapped, not only tracking that wolf or bear or mountain  
**[0:51:34-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:51:34):**  lion, but since they're the Keystone species, they're moving everything else.  So you're also tracking sort of the smallest vole and the birds and the plants because  everything's reacting and, um, sort of in this, in this dance with, uh, with one another.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:51:54):**  So, um, when predators are taken out of the landscape, you know, the, the biodiversity  plummets and the, you know, this has been shown.  So, um, you know, I spent a lot of time in deep wilderness areas, tracking predators,  
**[0:52:10-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:52:10):**  tracking large predators.  So, um, I would say if anybody wants to be a regen, like a regenerative rancher, then  go learn from nature and, uh, you know, all the other stuff can come along the way.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:52:27):**  Um, you know, the things like fencing and profitability and, uh, management systems,  um, you know, without a strong root rooting and grounding in nature and ecology, you can't  really call yourself a regenerative rancher.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:52:52):**  That's kind of, kind of a good mic drop right there.  I love that.  You, you tracked, like when I first found that out about you, I was like, man, that  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:52:59):**  is bad ass.  Like I, I like, it's amazing.  Like I'm scared.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:53:02):**  What's going to crap on me to run into a huge predator.  But what are you going to do today?  Oh, I saw some, saw some bear tracks.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:53:13):**  I'm going to go follow him and see where he's going.  But yeah, I totally scanned what you're saying.  Um, large, large predators aren't very common out here in my part of the world.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:53:25):**  Um, you know, anecdotally, I would say that, you know, we're within well within the range  of wolves and bear.  But pretty much all we have is our large predators would be limited to coyotes, um, bobcats, if  
**[0:53:39-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:53:39):**  you'd call them large.  And occasionally we have a cougar or mountain lion.  And I was fortunate enough, um, right around Christmas, we had a little snow.  
**[0:53:50-0:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:53:50):**  We found a set of mountain lion tracks and it's not something I get a chance to do.  And that day I had time and I tracked him for over a half a mile through the snow across  several ridges and through several canyons.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:54:05):**  And it's real interesting just to see how he's moving and where he stopped and what  he was looking at and what he could see along the way.  And I learned quite a bit just in that couple hours of tracking him a half of a mile.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:54:19):**  You're muted.  I'm not the only one that does it.  I know I do need to kind of wrap up here since I only gave myself an hour for this.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:54:36):**  So if there's any other questions you might have.  Okay.  Well, um, I think I think we've we've got covers.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:54:44):**  Or anything you'd like to know from me or CK?  Um, yeah, how's uh, I mean, let's see.  Let me think like what?  
**[0:54:53-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:54:53):**  That's a good question.  Um, I don't know what, what what are you guys most passionate about right now?  Oh, I'm kind of I'm getting pretty wrapped up in this podcast and, and just trying to  
**[0:55:12-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:55:12):**  spread more knowledge and trying to educate and get the word out there about these regenerative  practices talking to producers like yourself, and trying to get these stories out and trying  to motivate people to be more involved in their food to shake the hand that feeds you  
**[0:55:31-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:55:31):**  and understand, understand the food production cycle.  Like there's a lot more to it than just the truck backing up at Walmart and unloading  stuff.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:55:40):**  I mean, that's not where eggs and eggs and flour and bread and beef come from.  You know, there's it.  There's so few of us these days in agriculture that we have to do a better job of telling  
**[0:55:54-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:55:54):**  our story.  We have to connect with our consumer.  And I think that that's what that's what's that's why I'm getting out of bed in the morning  
**[0:56:03-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:56:03):**  is telling those stories and and trying to trying to help people connect back with their  food.  I think mine is just creating resiliency with actual like local communities like you realizing  
**[0:56:16-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:56:16):**  their COVID like just how brittle this can be.  I think we all can go back to if you can be self-sufficient in your community, then you're  going to be setting yourself up for success.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:56:29):**  Building building local self-sufficient resilient communities.  Yep.  So you said you've got to go.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:56:40):**  Did we leave anything on the table?  Any other resources or websites or a second book?  I want to talk.  
**[0:56:47-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:56:47):**  What is the name of your second book?  Yeah, my second book is called Wolf Girl and it's the young adult version of my first book.  So if you're an adult, check out Dawn again.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:57:00):**  It's also available.  It's available anywhere books are sold.  And it's also on audio.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:57:07):**  And if you have a teen or a young adult in your life that you feel would benefit from  connecting with nature and immerse immersion to lead to a regenerative life, then you can  check out Wolf Girl.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/16-Doniga-Markegard-Marketing-Through-Connections-e127tls#t=0:57:24):**  So yeah.  Okay.  And where can we find you on socials?

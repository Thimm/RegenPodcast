I hope you've been enjoying the bonus content.  Today is the first episode of a dairy mini series.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:01:03):**  Coming up, we've got several different dairy producers to offer different perspectives  on what it's like to make it in the dairy industry in the 2020s.  For the first part of this dairy series, we've got Jeff Ramsayer, who works for Organic Valley,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:01:20):**  a producer cooperative that aggregates and sells dairy products.  So Jeff, welcome to the show.  So Jeff, tell us a little bit about Organic Valley first off.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:01:31):**  It's a co-op that actually started with, I should know exactly how many, but I think  it was seven farmers back around 1988.  The last big farm crisis before what we're in now.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:01:43):**  They had basically been kind of shut out of a lot of the markets.  They were paying way below what the value was of the milk.  So they decided to do their own.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:01:53):**  The guy that kind of pushed it was George Seaman.  He was actually a dairy farmer and a vegetable producer.  So he kind of got it going and he was actually the CEO up until about two years ago, I believe.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:07):**  They went from when they first started their sign a little bit of cheese up to, I forget  what year it was, but we became a billion dollar company selling a billion dollars a  product.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:18):**  So he took it the whole way.  Here we must be muted.  I am muted.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:27):**  Sometimes I do that.  I see your mouth moving, but nothing coming out.  So I'm familiar with Organic Valley milk and I used to be a consumer of Organic Valley  
**[0:02:37-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:37):**  and I hope you don't.  We found a local producer that we buy raw milk from, but Organic Valley milk is a great  alternative to somebody in a dense urban area where you don't have access to a local raw  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:49):**  dairy, right?  Yes.  And actually, here in Ohio, raw milk is illegal, so that gets a little tricky.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:02:56):**  Some states it is legal, Ohio is not one.  Here in Kansas, you can sell it on the farm, but you can't really advertise it more than  just hanging a sign out front.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:09):**  Just another one of those fun food police rules that we all have to play by.  There's ways to do it in Ohio too.  It's called a herd share, basically.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:17):**  Yep, she had to get her raw handler certificate before she was able to sell it too.  That's in Idaho.  I don't think we really need to get down food police rabbit trails today.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:31):**  So what other products, we're all familiar with the milk, so what other products does  Organic Valley produce out of the co-op?  Well, we also have eggs.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:39):**  We have an egg pool.  I only have five here in Ohio.  I believe we have around 50 producers across the country, egg producers.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:48):**  Then we also do pork and beef.  We do sell a grass-fed beef product, but it's actually made from one of our co-op members  that's in Australia.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:03:58):**  That meat comes from Australia, but it is a co-op member that provides that.  Okay.  So are most of your, I mean obviously your milk producers have to be local because we  
**[0:04:08-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:04:08):**  can't really ship that in from Australia.  So as part of the co-op, how traceable are your products?  How traceable?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah.  I never had that question asked.  Like can you take a carton of milk and trace that back to the farm?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:04:27):**  Yes, you can trace it back to where it was processed by the number on there.  There's actually a QR code on there on most of them now.  There's also a plant code that will tell you where it's made.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:04:41):**  But from that, you'd have to get onto our side of the site to see where that milk actually  came from.  Our company knows where it all comes from.  
**[0:04:48-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:04:48):**  And we have to have at least a fairly good traceability because even though we are organic  milk, they still have to test us for antibiotics.  That's a law, at least in Ohio, I'm pretty sure it's across the country.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:01):**  So we have to have owner sample.  When the milkman comes, he picks a sample up of the milk.  Then that sample has to stay for X amount of days so they can retest it if needed for  
**[0:05:12-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:12):**  any kind of issue.  We can trace it back to those samples which would go to a load sample, which would go  to the plant then from there.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:24):**  On this podcast we talk all about regenerative agriculture and shaking the hand that feeds  you.  And we realize that that's not possible for everybody.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:33):**  You take an urban dweller in a major urban center like Chicago or New York City or LA,  this is a way to get some really good products and good nutrition back into those areas,  right?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:49):**  Correct.  Unfortunately, we don't have a whole lot of what we call local product.  We do have some that's actually bottled in.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:05:55):**  The Wisconsin bottling is done on a Wisconsin box.  It's in cartons.  It's not actually in bottles.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:02):**  It's in cardboard cartons.  But here in Ohio, we don't have that processing.  So basically some of that milk would actually come from out of the area and then our milk  
**[0:06:11-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:11):**  goes to other areas.  So it's not necessarily, we try to keep that carbon footprint down, but this doesn't seem  to be that way because we don't invest in a lot of brick and mortar.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:22):**  So we don't own a lot of plants.  So we basically, they call it co-packing, we pay them to pack for us.  So it's a little screwy because of all the rules.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:30):**  So it's a little tough.  How long have you been there at Organic Valley?  I've been here since September of 2015.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:38):**  So it'll be six years in September.  Seven years, about seven and a half years before that, I worked for a company called  National Farmers Organization.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:46):**  And I took care of dairy farmers' quality, you know, for their milk.  So we would get lists pronounced with people that had issues and I'd go out and help them  with those issues.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:06:55):**  That's what I did before this.  So you brought a lot of quality control background and a lot of knowledge about how to make milk  better from a forage and a nutrition standpoint then?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:06):**  Yes.  Yeah, that's what I did before was the, it was a lot more about, it was actually a lot  more about the equipment side.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:14):**  You know, if your equipment gets dirty, then you're going to get bacteria, you're going  to get problems.  But, you know, on my, on our own farms and stuff, I learned the nutrition side of it,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:23):**  you know, coming in from that, but not so much with NFO.  That's not what I did there.  So like I was saying, you know, on this podcast, we like to talk about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:07:35-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:35):**  and shaking the hand that feeds you.  So how does that play in with Organic Valley's mission?  Good question.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:48):**  I can skip it.  We can edit that out later.  Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how to answer that one.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:07:54):**  Because unfortunately, we just don't, we can't have every farmer come into the customer.  That's just, we'd love it that way, but it's not that way.  Well, but that's why we have, that's why there's going to be a need in the food space for co-ops  
**[0:08:09-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:09):**  like Organic Valley, that, you know, can go out to the rural areas, aggregate product  and have a lightweight enough, a low carbon distribution chain to get product into some  of these denser urban areas that, you know, that Bob and Joe's raw milk down the street  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:29):**  that they can't, you know, they can't necessarily penetrate that market.  Yeah, exactly right.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah.  We're more on a, you know, on a nationwide scale.  So we don't have that direct farmer to, you know, farmer to consumer connection.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:42):**  Like when we sell our beef or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:46):**  What do you think the furthest, like the different regional dairies they travel?  Like it's somewhat localized though from there, don't you think?  Somewhat, yes.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:08:57):**  We actually have our distribution centers in Cashton, Wisconsin, which is just north  about 15 miles north of 15, 20 miles north of La Farge, which is like the middle of nowhere,  a tiny, tiny town.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:09:12):**  There's just a big, we call it a people warehouse.  It's our headquarters there at La Farge and they had a few small buildings, but the, at  Cashton it's a big distribution center.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:09:23):**  And I forget, I've been in there several times, but it's six, seven pallets high and it's  all electronic, you know, computerized, a little robot goes around and picks everything.  So we're not a real big fan of how much trucking we do back and forth because like the eggs  
**[0:09:40-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:09:40):**  that are produced here, they actually get packaged about 20 minutes west of here and  then put onto a frozen, you know, onto a cooler truck.  And then they're sent up there and distributed from there.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:09:53):**  So to me, that's a lot of carbon back and forth.  According to their models, it's less.  I'm not sure exactly how that works.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:02):**  Efficiencies of transportation.  I'm told, I think it was a week or two ago when I was talking to my friend, Mike Calacrate,  and I don't know if this made it on the episode or not, but we were talking about the shipping  
**[0:10:15-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:15):**  cost from Australia and he said it's only 7 cents a pound to ship from Australia on  a boat.  I thought it'd be way more than that.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:26):**  That's why we don't have a domestic grass fed beef.  I've been pushing for that, so that we could do that.  But we can get that delivered.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:33):**  Oh, I forget what, it's really low.  It's less than what we would ever wholesale for here.  Delivered to Minnesota.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:42):**  Frozen.  It's insane.  I don't want to talk bad about your business, but I think it is insane that we can't sell  
**[0:10:51-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:10:51):**  our grass fed product in this country because there's no mass marketing channel.  The marketing channels we have are all geared for CAFO animals.  And the grass fed meat that's in the stores is all imported from Australia and New Zealand.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:08):**  And now that I understand it's only 7 cents a pound.  That's why.  Still, it's really hard to see how that's benefiting anybody.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:21):**  Just the middle man.  Just the middle man.  Just the middle man and just the packer, right?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:27):**  We don't want to go down that rabbit trail today.  That was Mike's episode.  I've spent enough time hearing about the packers and tweeting about the packers for a while.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:37):**  So we'll ignore them for a while.  So what other types of products besides dairy?  You said you have eggs, butter, milk, cheese, cream.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:51):**  You name it.  If somebody wants it, we'll use your producer.  They have flavored creamers.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:11:58):**  They have all kinds of stuff like that.  Plus we also do eggs.  We have a pork pool.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:12:03):**  So we have all kinds of different pork products.  And beef.  And you work with quite a few different producers throughout the course of your work.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:12:15):**  So one of the things that's really on my mind, I've really tried to work hard the last couple  weeks to wrap my head around is what does a regenerative dairy look like that maintains  milk production through the year?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:12:30):**  We actually, of course all of ours are organic.  But we have some that are, we actually have some we call grass milk.  So they do not plant any, you know, they don't feed any grain.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:12:42):**  That's in my opinion, that's probably the closest as far as regenerative that we've  got.  We've got, well, I actually have 60 some producers total.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:12:51):**  Well, I have 80 now.  Producers total and probably a third of those are grass milk now.  And there was at least six of those that were grass milk before we had a bonus for it.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:03):**  Now it's a $5 premium.  Those guys had it figured out.  They were doing it before it was an extra.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:10):**  The premium is that you said $5 is that $5 per hundred pounds?  Per hundred.  Okay.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:16):**  So milk is generally bought, sold and traded in hundred pound lots?  Correct.  Okay.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:23):**  Okay.  Um, the other day it was a, it was Monday evening.  I stopped by a dairy that we buy from and he's a raw grass dairy.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:37):**  Um, and he, I got a chance to walk out to his fields and got to see his forages and  he's on daily moves and he's got lanes and we were talking about how to minimize some  of the trailing back and forth to lanes.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:50):**  Like, well, you know, I think that just might be a sacrifice you have to make because you  have to come in and out twice a day out of your barn because your cows like to lay down  in the barn.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:13:59):**  Um, he was, he was showing me this, uh, I forgot what he called it, but it was an old  style milking barn where they'd come in, stand up on a concrete deal.  Then he could come in and milk them.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:14:09):**  And he said, that's what K state told him to build like 30 years ago and he built it  and you know, and it was concrete and he said that all the research said that, you know,  it's gotta be a concrete floor.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:14:20):**  You gotta wash it twice a day.  Now he doesn't even wash it out.  And he says, when it gets a little dirty, he just brings in some more wood chips and  
**[0:14:25-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:14:25):**  some more hay.  And when it gets too deep, he just scoops it up, puts it on his compost pile.  And the cool thing that he's, that he started to do with his compost, uh, I mean, he obviously  
**[0:14:37-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:14:37):**  hauls that back out in his fields, but for his winter protein, he doesn't buy in any  inputs for his winter protein.  He gets a barley, rye and wheat and he sprouts them in this little room and he's got a continuous  
**[0:14:53-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:14:53):**  process to sprout grain and he, and it's in like an aquaponics type system.  So when it gets, you know, three, four inches tall root and all, it goes right into the  mixer with the dry ration that he saved all, say from the growing season.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:09):**  That's what he feeds his cows all winter.  That just blew my mind.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:14):**  They call that a fodder system.  We didn't, I've done that before.  They're so cool.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:19):**  That was really hot a few years ago and it's kind of gone away here.  So okay.  If it's gone away there, what are guys, uh, what if, what if some of your producers move  
**[0:15:27-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:27):**  to for winter protein?  Um, winter, basically what most of my guys on, especially on the grass side, they're  taking sorghum sedan or sorghum sedan mix and using that through the winter baleage.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:39):**  Um, some guys, we have very little alfalfa here, uh, but a lot of clover.  So a clover, um, clover, oats, peas, anything like that, you know, harvested in the spring  is some pretty good feed to go through the winter.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:15:53):**  And we do have some guys that they are seasonal, so they'll freshen in the fall and then they're  just milking through the winter.  So it's, it kind of depends on the grass side.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:16:05):**  You know, this from grass, but beef, it's the same thing.  It's all about energy.  At least here, uh, protein, you can get all the protein you ever want from anything here.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:16:14):**  Um, but protein can be too much and that's usually the issue.  If you don't have enough energy, of course you're burning energy to get rid of that protein,  but um, mostly baleage through the winter here.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:16:24):**  The protein, the energy and the dry, they all have to be balanced through the year.  Yeah.  So I'm interested a little bit more about Jeff, about your history and how, how did  
**[0:16:36-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:16:36):**  you get kicked off down to this organic and regenerative trail?  Um, it actually started right soon after I started with NFO.  At that time, I think I had 35 or 40, um, producers and that would have been 2008, right  
**[0:16:53-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:16:53):**  when that big kind of downturn happened.  After that downturn went away, I guess you'd say, say 2000, mid 2009, we started to have  what's called the gold, what we call the gold rush in the United, in the organic systems,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:17:07):**  I guess, where they wanted way more milk than we could ever provide.  So basically I went from say 35, 38 producers to 165, 170 in, in that seven year time, actually  probably six year time.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:17:25):**  And most of it was organic valley producers and also Horizon, which is, you know, our  direct competitor now.  Um, but I just, it just made sense to me.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:17:35):**  I grew up on a, on a confinement hog barn, hog facility, not a big fan of that.  My brother runs that now, but I was always at the dairy farm at my uncle's dairy farm  because I liked to be outside.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:17:47):**  Um, and it just made sense to me, you know, the, the land works with you and you don't  fight nature and off you go.  It makes sense.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:17:56):**  Definitely.  One of the things that, that my friend that runs the dairy, I stopped at a few days ago  was saying is, you know, we'd like to talk about the meat.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:07):**  You know, we like to talk about the meat and building food hubs around meat and his argument,  he made a really strong argument for building the food hubs around dairy.  And I can definitely see that because, you know, dairy is a steady supply.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:22):**  You know, it's, it's pretty steady.  Yeah.  Same with eggs.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:26):**  Dairy and eggs, I think would go together pretty well.  I forget how many chickens he had, but we saw both of his chicken tractors and they  are a lot of chickens.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, you guys running their, um, running layers behind their dairy cows and  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:42):**  that helps them, you know, it's another one of those synergy things that's taking  care of flies for them too at the same time and producing some really good eggs for not  a whole lot of money.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:50):**  And doing a lot of great, uh, biological cycling in the soil and you know, some light tillage  and pest control.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:18:58):**  His store.  I don't know if I've seen that much cheese outside of a cheese truck.  It's just racks and racks of cheese.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:19:10):**  But he has, uh, the community they're in, they've been doing this for a while and other  people have started growing food and bringing it in and selling it in their store.  And I hope next week, I hope the next episode will be with this gentleman.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:19:27):**  Don't want to spoil the name yet, but I'm hoping we can do two dairy episodes here back  to back.  I had, uh, Monday I had to pick up an order from there, you know, some milk, some cream,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:19:43):**  but we also got carrots and celery, um, some lettuce and some bread and a few other things.  And I got home and my lady, she whipped up a real nice soup for me that, uh, you know,  normally you can eat a full bowl of soup, but when it's good, really good stuff with  
**[0:19:59-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:19:59):**  a lot of nutrient dense bioavailable, good, healthy food.  Seemed like I only ate about half of it.  Yep.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:20:11):**  So, what are, what are some of the different types of dairy management and how important  is mental health to a dairyman?  Different types of dairy management.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:20:24):**  Ours of course has to be pasture based, but on the conventional side, there's a lot  of different ways, you know, with some past, when I was with NFO, we had guys that would,  would pasture, uh, fairly intensively.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:20:35):**  Then we had guys that would have a pasture where they, it was just an exercise lot, you  know, getting outside.  Um, we had guys that would be what we call tie stalls.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:20:44):**  So the cows would stay in all the time and be tied.  Um, that's something that most everybody's getting away from because of labor.  You have to bring everything directly to that cow.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:20:53):**  I still do have a few farms over, um, in the Mennonite area here close that are still tie  stalls.  Um, but as soon as the kids get too old, uh, they tend to build a parlor mainly because  
**[0:21:05-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:05):**  it's just too labor intensive, you know, as well, I'm almost 50, so I know what that's  like, but when you're shoveling silage all day long, it's, it's no fun.  And then you get a, most of them have, would have gutter cleaners, but some of my Amish  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:19):**  guys do not.  So then you get a shovel that shovel this stuff, you get to take out too.  So you're shoveling it in and shoveling it out.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:26):**  And it weighs on you pretty hard.  It's a lot of work.  Takes a lot of energy to move that, you know, that all that biomass in then move all that  
**[0:21:35-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:35):**  biomass back out.  And that's why the management intensive grazing came around here.  It caught on like wildfire because everybody had a tie stall.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:44):**  Like you mean we could put the cows out and we don't have to carry them feed and all their  men or wow.  Who would have thought of that?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:51):**  What a crazy system.  Cows can walk?  No, their theory was that beef cows do that, not dairy cows.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:21:59):**  You know, dairy cows have to be right there.  You have to feed them every single stitch of food.  And there's still a few farms that are like that, but they're mostly big farms that can,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:22:08):**  you know, afford to do that.  So how much does milk production generally suffer going from, going from like your typical  Holstein dairy that's on full feed, full high energy feed, you know, high energy corn silage  
**[0:22:24-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:22:24):**  ration all year?  What's what's the milk production difference look like there?  We've got guys in our area that are easily averaging 80 to 85 pounds or even over 100  
**[0:22:37-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:22:37):**  pounds per cow per day, which is insane, in my opinion.  I'd hate to see their cost, but because they're big enough, you know, the whole efficiency  thing makes it cheap.  
**[0:22:50-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:22:50):**  But on our dairies, I'd say we probably average somewhere in that 35 to 40 pounds here.  We're mostly a, and we've always been that way because the cheese plants, but we're mostly  a colored breed, you know, mostly Jersey or Jersey Holstein crosses, because in this area,  
**[0:23:06-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:06):**  that's what you get paid for is whole is fat and protein.  That's how they figure calculate your price per hundred is what you know what you have  there.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:16):**  Now, if it was all fluid milk, then it really doesn't matter what your protein and fat are  because they skim it down to 3.25 for whole milk anyway.  Those are the guys that have the big, big, big, huge Holsteins, right?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:29):**  Yes, exactly.  Yeah.  And produce a lot of white water is basically what it comes down to.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:35):**  Yeah.  But it's all about fluid.  It's not about you know, what's actually in it.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:39):**  So I would say our average farm here is somewhere below 45 pounds.  I've got a couple that are in the 45 pound range, but they're extremely intensive on  their, you know, everything, you know, they're really on it.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:23:54):**  And it's not just how many.  And I think what a lot of guys get caught up in is pounds of milk, not what did you  have to spend or what were your inputs to get that versus what would your inputs be  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:24:06):**  at 20% less production?  Yes, it's exactly the same on the dairy side as it is on the beef side.  It's just a different parameter.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:24:14):**  You know, you can have a, you know, a 1700 pound cow that gives you an 800 pound calf,  but you know, what's it cost to get that calf to that weight?  It's the same exact idea.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:24:25):**  And ours, our guys are fairly low cost, especially in this area, they don't take on a whole lot  of debt, but they prefer not to mostly because they're what we call plain folks.  They're, you know, Mennonites, Amish, I'm probably 95% plain with my producers here  
**[0:24:42-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:24:42):**  and I have some in Somerset, PA over by Pittsburgh.  So that changes changes a little bit, but we're probably 90, 85 to 90% Jersey or Jersey  cross cows, just because of that.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:24:59):**  That's really interesting.  That's that is really interesting.  And I'm, I'm starting to see that more of the dairies and dairymen that I that I know  
**[0:25:10-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:25:10):**  when I interact with on social media are switching away from those, those, you know, five and  a half, six foot tall Holstings that look like skin and bones.  And they're, you know, moving to jerseys or jersey crosses or Dutch belted cows, Dutch  
**[0:25:28-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:25:28):**  belted.  We have a couple guys that had been Dutch belt for quite a while.  Dutch belt don't tend to produce very much.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:25:37):**  So they, it makes it hard to pay for farms, you know, if you don't have the production,  young guys that are buying new farms or dads helping them buy new farms, they, they need  the production to, you know, to pay bills.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:25:49):**  So the, the Dutch belts will live forever.  I mean, there'll be 25, 30 years old.  We've got a guy that has Brown Swiss that he would sell us call cows through NFO that  
**[0:25:59-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:25:59):**  were 17 to 25 years old all the time.  And you would never guess it.  They just live forever, but they're not high produced and they're not pushed forever because  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:26:08):**  they're not pushed with a real super high energy diet.  Yeah.  The, the Holsteins, I forget, I haven't seen what the number lately, but last I heard of  
**[0:26:17-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:26:17):**  their average college was somewhere between three and four years old.  So that means you milked her one time and maybe a half of the time and she's gone.  So that's tough.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:26:26):**  Oh, but that one time you milked her, she gave a hundred pounds of milk a day, right?  She did, but it takes a long time to pay for that heifer doing that.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:26:37):**  So do you want to talk at all about Holstein genetics and like how inbred and line bread  they all are?  I just saw that on there, actually Holstein and Jerseys are, you know, most of the breeds  
**[0:26:51-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:26:51):**  in general are line bread way back.  I haven't seen a number lately either on the Holsteins, but I want to say, I can't remember  the name of it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:01):**  I think it was elevation was his name from the mid eighties.  And I want to say like 60% of the genome is tied back to him now because it's just, and  I don't, don't quote me on that name because I can't remember for sure, but they, they  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:15):**  really concentrate them and, and usually it works, I guess, but it'll work till it doesn't,  I suppose.  I exactly.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:22):**  And what works, what I would consider working and what somebody else would consider working  are two different things.  If you're losing cows at four years, it's not working, you know, it's just not, but  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:32):**  that seems to, you know, the whole efficiency thing, you know,  But they got a hundred pounds of milk out of her every day.  Exactly right.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah.  But what's that at what cost, you know, that that's what your cost is to getting that cow  to, you know, heifer to the point where she milks after that, it's just feed costs.  
**[0:27:49-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:27:49):**  But before that you're feeding her for, you know, two years, maybe a touch more depending  on what breed or how you do your management, but you got all that cost to get back and  you can't get that back in one lactation, even on the organic side, it just doesn't  
**[0:28:03-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:03):**  work that way.  Even though organics double the price, it still just doesn't calculate that way.  Interesting.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:13):**  I, I was kind of under the impression that most Holsteins can go, go back to pretty much  two bulls back in the fifties or sixties.  That wouldn't surprise me.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:26):**  I just have this feeling that there's impending genetic collapse.  I mean, they can't be more than a couple generations away if they keep line breeding  and inbreeding some of those traits.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:39):**  I think that they're going to have, they're going to start having problems soon.  And maybe it's already showing itself with, with the cows only last in three, four years,  one or two, maybe a third production cycle.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:51):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it just seems like every once in a while, an outcross pops up where that outcross comes  
**[0:28:58-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:28:58):**  from never made any sense to me, but that's what they'll do.  They'll bring that out cross in and then he's the new hot one and they'll breed him to him  for two, three years.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:29:07):**  And then, Oh, he's not the hot one.  We'll use this hot one.  And it seems like they're just chasing their tail to get the exact same thing.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:29:12):**  It's not really gaining much in my opinion, but if you, if you ever watched a dairy show,  if you'd ever go to, like we go up to the one in the world, Derexpo in Wisconsin, if  you went up there and looked at those cows, half of those cows are so what we would consider  
**[0:29:31-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:29:31):**  frail or thin that they couldn't function on a normal basis, you know, dealing with  other, with the herd mates.  Like they just couldn't physically keep that up, but they, you know, keep them in the,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:29:45):**  they keep them in a box stall or whatever, carry all their feed to them and make them  look like they do.  No, even now the hot thing is they actually clip their ribs to make them look even more  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:29:58):**  frail.  It's insane, but that's what they do.  That's the hair to make them look thinner.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:30:04):**  That's a little crazy, but those aren't your producers, right?  Those aren't your organic value producers.  Ours are functional cattle.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:30:10):**  So let's talk about that a little bit, like some of the differences.  The main difference is guts, both width and depth.  You have to have that just like your beef cows.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:30:22):**  If you don't, if you can't get enough forage in there, she can't produce what you need  her to do, you know, to get that energy out.  And even on, you know, on our, what we would call our non grass fed or non grass milk,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:30:35):**  organic milk, you still can only feed 30% outside of pasture during the grazing season.  70% of their feed has to come from grazing.  So no matter what genetics you're using, you still have to have one that can graze.  
**[0:30:49-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:30:49):**  You can't physically get enough in and that 30% to make up for a kind of a slab sided  cow, you know, that just doesn't have the width, doesn't have the, uh, it's just like  beef cows, a big muzzle, um, good appetite and good feet to get out there and do it and  
**[0:31:04-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:04):**  walk back.  A cow with a two and a half inch wide mouth is going to have a harder time getting her  guts folded, a cow with a six inch wide mouth, unless you weigh 700 pounds and it wouldn't  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:13):**  matter much.  Hey, quit talking about my Korean is like that.  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:18):**  It's all relative.  Two and a half inch on a 700 pound compared to a 1200 pound would not work.  Right.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:27):**  That's one of the things that I look for.  Fina typically is, is with the, the mouth in relation to the width of the hips.  You know, you want that mouth to be as wide as possible in relation to the hits.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:38):**  I mean, she's got big old wide hips and a tiny little mouth.  She needs to go on the bus and find another place to get a job.  Yeah.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:44):**  Well, more than likely she'll not get bread.  Yeah.  That's that's, that explains why I have some of my donuts this year.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:31:54):**  So what are some of the biggest challenges facing the dairy industry right now from your  point of view?  Dairy industry in general.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:32:03):**  A lot of it has to do with pricing.  The farmer keeps getting less and less of the total milk dollar every year.  It just seems to be the way it is.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:32:13):**  We're, I'm not sure what the conventional price is right now.  Last I heard my cousin milks conventional and he ships to a cheese plant.  So he has a good market, but I think there's, they're around 18 to $20, somewhere in that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:32:28):**  range per hundred.  Where most places their cost of production is 16 to $18.  So that's why they have to produce a hundred pounds, a hundred pounds of milk to even,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:32:43):**  you know, get ahead of what they, what they're getting paid for it.  So that's where the efficiency part comes in, I guess.  I feel like I'd rather get 30 bucks a pound or get, you know, $30 a hundred for a bunch  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:32:59):**  of cows that are only going to produce 35 pounds a day.  Makes sense.  I'd rather be a cow for 12 years rather than a cow that's going to make me a hundred pounds  
**[0:33:06-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:33:06):**  of milk on two cycles and then be done.  And that $2 a hundred weight margin, that's awful thin.  So what are some ways that we can start getting more of that consumer food dollar back to  
**[0:33:26-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:33:26):**  the producer in the dairy sphere?  It gets a little tricky because it's not like selling meat where you can just, at least  in Ohio, you can't just say, okay, I'm going to go direct to consumer.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:33:40):**  That's you know, that's really the simplest way on the beef side is to do that.  But on the dairy side, it gets really tricky.  You could start your own co-op, you could bring up your own, start up your own creamery.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:33:52):**  We actually have one about 15 minutes from here that they started that two or three years  ago.  And then maybe, oh, that had been probably five, six years ago, north of us that started  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:03):**  one, they're close to Cleveland.  So they're selling most of theirs direct to consumer.  So that does help.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:10):**  But then, and you talked about mental health earlier, a dairy farmer is, in my opinion,  is way worse than say a livestock farmer.  Dairy farmers have so many balls in the area that it's hard to keep everything going straight.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:26):**  And then you throw in, okay, let's make our own products.  And then you become a plant manager on top of that.  And it's tough.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:34):**  I don't know how those guys do it.  Dairymen in my mind are already the hardest working guys in the ag sector period.  Yes.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:43):**  I have a lot of respect for all the dairymen.  And I try to appreciate every glass of milk or every piece of cheese that I drink because  I know how hard some of these guys work on such razor thin margins to put that product  
**[0:34:58-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:34:58):**  on my table and on the shelf.  I had somewhere I had somewhere I was going with that and I forgot.  Okay.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:08):**  As far as getting more back to the farmer, that's going to come down to changes in the  laws, changes in they call them federal milk orders.  So basically, we're in a different milk order here than say you guys would be out there.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:22):**  That's all controlled by the government.  And then it's called pooling.  It gets very complicated.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:27):**  When I started with NFO, I was probably there six months.  And my boss had been in the dairy industry for 30 plus years.  And we are farmers in western Pennsylvania, which is two and a half hours.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:38):**  And he was riding over there with me.  And I said, okay, we have a two and a half hour drive.  Can you explain to me how we price milk?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:44):**  And he said, I need a lot more time than that.  I said, right there is a big problem.  This should be simple.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:35:51):**  With all of our electronics, we should be able to say, okay, we made that we sold this  many products, we took in this much milk over the whole country.  I mean, they do that stuff all the time with everything else.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:36:02):**  Why can't we do that with milk?  But according to the to the law, that doesn't matter.  It's based on all these other pricing, in my opinion, schemes that make it tough to  
**[0:36:13-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:36:13):**  basically get a real well, it's a little bit like the beef as far as price discovery.  You know, it's, it's all crazy.  Well, a lot of our problem in the beef industry with with lack of price discovery is, you  
**[0:36:28-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:36:28):**  know, formulas and grids and, you know, Ford contracting and, and the Packers being able  to take and purchase cattle outside the cash market.  And they say, well, the value is tied to the cash market.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:36:41):**  Well, there's almost nothing that moves on the cash market, at least fat cattle or slaughter  ready cattle.  It's like they're basing their grid and formula numbers on numbers that that don't  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:36:51):**  even really exist in reality.  Yes, and that actually happens some on the dairy side, too, because it's based on,  and I'm going to get all these mixed up, but it's M&W.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:01):**  So I think it's like Minnesota and Wisconsin, actual cash, I guess you'd call them cash  dairy sales, where there's none of those either.  So it's, you know, what's the cheese worth a pound?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:10):**  Well, we'll just sell some and say that's what it's worth.  Well, unfortunately, it's just like going having one buyer at a sale barn.  What's it going to bring whatever he decides?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:21):**  And that's, that's basically what it comes down to whatever the middleman of the dairy  industry decide, as far as conventional organics completely different, but conventional is  really, really controlled by all that.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:33):**  And I think that's where all the, you know, the mental health issues and the just the  stress because they don't know, month to month what they're going to be paid.  It's kind of whatever they feel like paying them.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:45):**  And how do you base a business on no clue what you're going to get paid?  It's hard to do.  Yeah, I wouldn't want to do it.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:37:54):**  Yeah.  So like circling back on this mental health thing.  There's a little anecdote that I've heard several times about, there's a couple man  
**[0:38:04-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:38:04):**  and wife and they had a small dairy together.  And they started having some relationship problems, and they decided they were going  to get a divorce.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:38:15):**  So they decided they're going to split the milking chores.  One of them would milk in the morning, the other one would milk in the evening.  And they went in and you know, they're still running dairy together, but on on a different  
**[0:38:29-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:38:29):**  schedule so they didn't have to interact.  And over about two weeks, their milk quality just cratered.  Still get plenty volume, but the quality cratered and it got to the point after a month, they  
**[0:38:41-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:38:41):**  couldn't sell anything.  They brought in consultants, they brought in nutritionists, nobody could figure it out.  Then they went to a psychologist.  
**[0:38:50-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:38:50):**  And a psychologist said, you will never sell your dairy, you will never fix your problem  until you both get out of that milking barn.  So they hired somebody to come in and milk their cows.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:00):**  And guess what happened within a week?  Their quality came back up, and they had sellable product again, and the dairy started to get  profitable again.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:10):**  So I think there's something there about how the dairyman's attitude affects the cows.  Does that jive with any of your experience?  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:23):**  There's no question that it does.  I've had some issues with conventional dairies before where you know, same kind of deal that  it's just stress.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:31):**  You stress and stress and stress about, you know, can I make the payments this month?  Can I do this?  Can I do that?  
**[0:39:36-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:36):**  And it's almost when I like when I drive onto the farm, I could feel it like a bad energy.  I'm not really that type of guy that can feel that.  But you could feel it on some of those farms.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:47):**  Because say the wife would, and this is usually typical, the wife would take care of the calves.  The calves would start slipping a little bit because she's mad at him and then the cows  would start slipping because he's mad at her.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:39:58):**  And then next thing you know, they have to sell because there's just nowhere.  If you can't work together, it's just not going to work.  Or one leaves, you know, that's the only other option.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:09):**  But then one has to buy the other out.  So where's that come from?  Oh, we'll just go get a loan and pay 4% on that, right?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:15):**  Yeah, exactly.  We got another one.  Yep.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:18):**  Sure.  We got equity.  Yeah, we got equity.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:21):**  We'll just go pay 4% to the bank to buy it back.  Yep.  Makes sense.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:27):**  So if somebody was out there right now, let's just say our hypothetical listener is sitting  in Chicago downtown in a filing cabinet.  And they want to get in, they want to get in on this dairy thing.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:42):**  How would you tell somebody to start a dairy right now?  Wow.  As far as dairy in general, I would go for something that's not cows.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:40:53):**  You know, the sheep dairy seems to be really exploding.  The goats seem to be exploding here.  But as far as milking cows, it's so capital intensive to do it.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:41:06):**  You know, the conventional way with big free stalls, big everything.  If you're in a state where you can sell direct, then you could, you know, then you have options.  But in a state like ours where you can't, well, legally, you can't sell raw, it just  
**[0:41:21-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:41:21):**  locks you down to you have to do what everybody else is doing.  And that just isn't going to ever, well, in my opinion, it's not going to fly.  Unless you have a huge stack of money, you're going to live off for, well, until you quit  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:41:33):**  milking.  How do you make a million dollars in the dairy industry?  Start with free, right?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:41:39):**  Yeah, exactly.  So what are some, what motivates you to get out of bed right now, Jeff?  Well for us, it's our new farm, we took on a lease farm that we get a long term lease  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:41:56):**  on.  So that's what gets me, you know, gets me out of bed.  What gets me to work is trying to help these farmers.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:02):**  You know, it's a full time job for me, but I almost have a full time job at our farm  too.  So it's some time management stuff, but just helping these farmers do what, you know, do  
**[0:42:12-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:12):**  what they need, what they need help with, and getting them better, what we do.  We've talked quite a bit about your day job.  So let's talk about your farm a little bit.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:22):**  What's your plans for your farm?  Well, we kind of call it the old McDonald farm, because we have a little bit of everything.  We got hare sheep, we had some goats, sold those last week.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:35):**  Whatever you do, don't ever buy show goats to try to put them out on a pasture.  It doesn't work so well.  It was just a flop, but the price is so high that we still got our money back from when  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:44):**  we bought them last year.  Just a mess.  So we started leasing the farm officially in January.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:51):**  There's 70 acres there.  And so there's a little bit of stockpile on the one side.  So we took the sheep over there and the goats are with the sheep.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:42:58):**  And then we moved them, I don't know, maybe last week in December.  We had an abnormal winter for us.  So it's actually frozen.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:06):**  We usually have mud all winter.  So probably by Christmas, we were froze up and had, you know, six to eight inches of  snow on the ground.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:15):**  Well, the sheep could care less, they're grazing right under the snow just going to town.  The goats, I find them the next morning curled up in a corner crying because nobody was feeding  them.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:24):**  So then we knew we had an issue.  So we actually brought them back to our house.  We have a little shed, we could keep them in here.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:30):**  But we actually have, well, we have beef cows there.  We started a new thing for us this year was bringing grass fed stockers to get paid on  the game.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:41):**  We've got 19 right now.  We're probably going to get about 60 more between a couple of different farms.  I think that's a good cash flow for us, cash flow thing for us.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:43:52):**  But it's new, you know, we don't really know exactly.  But this farm has been in the in the family, I forget how many generations but since 1915.  But the last several years, it was kind of let run down a little bit, they leased out  
**[0:44:06-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:44:06):**  the grazing, at least up the crop fields and just stuff wasn't put back.  No, you just take, take, take, it doesn't work out so well.  So we're, it's a lot of work, but we can actually see stuff turning around already, you know,  
**[0:44:21-0:44:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:44:21):**  just from the cattle being there from the sheep being there.  And we sold sheep last week for the highest we've ever sold at 275 a pound.  So I mean, that's pretty good.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:44:31):**  We just need more sheep, you know, 20 ewes isn't a whole lot of cash.  But they can undo it.  But when you have over 100% weaning rate, and you're selling for that much, yeah, kind  
**[0:44:43-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:44:43):**  of makes a guy want to go buy some sheep.  Yeah, when we paid 275 for the mother and you get 188 for the baby, that's not too bad.  And she has two or one, we're about 165% 175% this year.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:44:56):**  So it's, that's pretty good.  That's a nice ratio.  Too bad we can't make cows have twins twice a year.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:03):**  They have tried, there's actually a guy here in Worcester that has been doing that with  the Mark twinners.  I don't know if you've heard of that.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:10):**  Mark through the, what is it, the Meat Animal Research Center.  There's a breed called Mark twinners, and he has them.  I don't know much about him, but that's what he does.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:20):**  They have twins every year.  Interesting.  I have a friend that lives about 40, 50 miles northeast of here.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:29):**  And last year, he was kind of bragging because he had seven sets of twins.  And I think this year he had like 10 or 12 sets of twins out of his cows.  And they're mostly straight up black Angus.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:39):**  That doesn't happen very often.  No, no, it's maybe I ought to go buy a couple of his cows and get some of that genetic in  my group.  
**[0:45:47-0:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:45:47):**  You got to have a cow that can handle twins though too.  That's where it gets a little tricky.  But with our sheep, we had 17 ewes and just off the top of my head, we had three yearlings  
**[0:46:00-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:46:00):**  that had singles and then we had four that had triplets.  So that really jacks up your and they raised them all on their on themselves.  So it's pretty profitable actually.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:46:14):**  I think we've heard that quite a bit that you know, sheep and goats are can be significantly  more profitable than cows in a right environment.  Yeah, you know, and I think that's one of the things that that a young producer definitely  
**[0:46:27-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:46:27):**  needs to look at is when you put some of the romanticism aside for a few minutes and say,  what makes the most economic sense to get started and it's not going and buying a big  ranch and a bunch of big horse trailers and horses to run cows.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:46:41):**  Maybe it's running sheep in a shoebox in somebody's backyard.  Yeah, yeah, we've, that's one thing I've been talking with my farmers a lot is, especially  Amish, they try to get their kids involved early, you know, young and like we have hair  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:46:57):**  sheep so we don't have to worry about the wool.  So I've told a lot of them that, you know, just get a few few hair sheep, your kids can  handle them.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:47:05):**  Like our, you know, they're not big, like ours are 125, 130 pounds, even the buck might  weigh 160 pounds.  So it's not like you're dealing with the, you know, 800 pound Holstein heifer or something  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:47:17):**  like that.  And it's very profitable and easy to get started because, you know, you used to be able to  get used for say $200.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:47:24):**  Now you're pushing it to get for 325, 350 just because they're worth so much as babies.  I mean, these, we took in 14, they average 65 pounds when normally in a normal market,  your highest value per pound is at 40 to 60 pounds.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:47:43):**  That's the ethnic market.  And they want them pig fat, like they want chunky little boogers.  Well now, because the way everything is, there's no price, what would you call it on the beef  
**[0:47:55-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:47:55):**  industry, like rollback or whatever, because you go from a 600 pound to an 800 pound.  In the sheep industry right now, or here anyway, and we have a big auction market here about  15, 20 miles from us, Malheaux, there's no rollback.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:48:10):**  So I figured why should I sell them at 60?  I'll just take them up to try to hit 70 and it didn't make a difference.  So here's to get 275 a pound for 65 pounders and say three months ago, that would have  
**[0:48:24-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:48:24):**  been a $2 per pound size.  So you know, you just kind of have to watch some of that too.  But with the kids, I think it'd be perfect for something like that.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:48:33):**  There's very basically on the hair sheep.  There's if, if you are diligent, there's no care.  You know, you don't have, you shouldn't have to trim feet.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:48:44):**  You shouldn't have, well, there's no wool, so you don't need to mess with that.  You put the buck out, you pull the buck, you weigh the lambs, you sell lambs, and we don't  sell our ewes, just like with our cows, we expose them all.

**[0:49:02-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:02):**  I mean, it's exactly the way we run our heifers too.  Everybody gets exposed and nature sorts out who's going to stay.  So it works.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:10):**  It works really well.  I like to say fertility drives the bus, but it just maybe kind of occurred to me that  lack of fertility drives the Jesus bus.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:20):**  Crashes the bus.  Drives the livestock trailer.  How about that?  
**[0:49:26-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:26):**  Yeah, there you go.  So you mentioned you had hair sheep.  Is there any sort of wool market there in Ohio at all?  
**[0:49:34-0:49:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:34):**  There is.  There's actually a big co-op in Southern Ohio that's been around for hundreds of years.  But to get, when I, let's see, when did that have been when I had sheep before?  
**[0:49:44-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:44):**  When I started with sheep, it was probably 99, somewhere in that range.  And I had, I just got sheep from wherever I could find them just to try it.  And those actually cost me to have somebody come shear them.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:49:57):**  So they would come and shear them.  You paid 10 bucks apiece, and they took all the wool.  So that never really made any sense to me.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:50:04):**  Now, if you get into the fine wools, like the Merinos and some of that kind of stuff,  out west, the Rambouillet, you know, the Targhee, that kind of that type, they say those have  value as far as wool value.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:50:18):**  Around here, what seems to have the value is for hand spinners.  They like the long hair, and I don't even know what they call them.  It's almost like a carpet type or something.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:50:28):**  It's just a long, fuzzy kind of wool, more than a fine wool that you'd make, you know,  clothing out of.  And then they just weave them into all kinds of stuff.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:50:38):**  But I just never really was a big fan.  And it was really hard to get shearers because nobody wanted to do a business that wasn't  making any money.  
**[0:50:49-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:50:49):**  That can be tough, too, if you don't have that infrastructure.  Like out west, from what I've heard from everywhere else, it's not near as hard to get that kind  of stuff because they have custom companies come in and shear.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:02):**  Those don't exist here.  You know, you'll have a guy, you know, running out of his pickup, you know, and he'll get  there when he gets there.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:08):**  Makes it a lot tougher.  Call Bob from down the road and he'll bring his good scissors, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:14):**  Well, they usually have good equipment, but one of those guys compared to one of those  custom deals where they come in with eight or 10 guys and they can go through a sheep  in 45 seconds or whatever they do now, that's a huge difference.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:27):**  But you're talking tens of thousands of sheep out there.  And that's not here.  I don't know of any big blocks here yet.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:35):**  We'll get there one day, won't we?  Actually, Ohio was one of the largest ones until kind of the west opened.  There's a lot of sheep here at that time.  
**[0:51:48-0:52:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:51:48):**  So what's the best advice you wish you had on your first day in the dairy industry?  I think it's something that it took a while to get through my head, but don't take it  personally because there's stuff that you just have to work through.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:52:13):**  And if you took it personal the whole time, you'd be banging your head against the wall  every day.  Um, that was, and it's the same thing for, you know, our farm too, you know, kind of  
**[0:52:23-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:52:23):**  just relax and work through it rather than getting upset and throwing stuff and screaming  and hollering.  And because I have done that, I think everybody has.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:52:33):**  We had one bad incident with my wife and kids and I ended up nutting 35 of the sixties years  myself because they all left my home.  So that was not a good day for me or them, but we didn't do that again.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:52:50):**  Got to take care of your health.  Yes, exactly.  Or do it yourself.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:52:54):**  And it was no fun doing it myself.  No, I don't.  I'm kind of a one man show, but when I need help, I need help and I make sure that they  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:00):**  are much appreciated when they show up.  Yep.  They are now.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:05):**  I was not listening back then, but we didn't have an adjustable alley.  So the calves were all turning around and I was just going nuts trying to push them  in and then they all left.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:14):**  So then I had to push them in and catch them at the same time.  So that was real fun.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:22):**  Not so much.  So um, so where can we find you on social media and how, how can we, uh, how can our  fans connect with you and how can our fans find out more about organic Valley?  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:33):**  Sure.  Organic Valley has everything.  They have Instagram, they have all that.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:37):**  I just have to search organic Valley.  We have, our farm is Lone Pine Pastures on Facebook.  On our list of things to get done as a website, we don't have that done yet.  
**[0:53:49-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:53:49):**  You can just look up Jeff Ramseur on Facebook and I believe I need to look because I got  hacked.  So there's two that are technically mine, but I couldn't get back into it.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:54:00):**  I can't remember if it's a boat that's on our online now or not.  Tell you what, I'll make sure I look and I get the link to the right, your correct profile  and I'll put that in the show notes page.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:54:14):**  Yeah.  The picture is us on the, on our boat.  And then the background, the background picture is at the farm.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:54:20):**  It says barns in flowers.  I'll make sure I get that link.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:54:31):**  So do you have any good cheat codes or hacks that, uh, shortcuts that help you out every  day?  Um, I would say the best cheat codes I've gone to is let nature sort everything out,  
**[0:54:46-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:54:46):**  you know, rather than me trying to figure out what the best heifer is or what the best  you is to keep, um, expose them all, give them the management that you have, you know,  as far as inputs and whoever does good as who you need to keep.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:55:01):**  No nice way to say that, but it's just almost like you need to be, uh, Mark Shepherd has  a, has a saying stun sheer total utter neglect.  I don't want to go quite that far, but I just don't want to, I want to make my animals work.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:55:19):**  That's what they're for rather than me working for them.  So that's for us, that's our main thing is if you get, well, you, of course, you know,  you know this too, but timing up your lambing, calving, whatever to the season.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:55:31):**  So, so everything works.  So like through the winter, we can, if we need hay, like this year we did because we  didn't have a stockpile, we can get them through hay, cheap, you know, cheap hay because they're  
**[0:55:40-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:55:40):**  a long ways from calving or lambing.  Um, so you can cheap them through the winter.  And then when grass comes, they got another month before the Gavin, it just works.  
**[0:55:50-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:55:50):**  I mean, it's worked for deer forever.  Why would it be any different for, for a cow or lamb or whatever?  But I just hear, especially because of Ohio is a show cattle state.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:03):**  So everybody's got eight, 10, I think our average now is 13 for the state as far as  beef herd size.  Um, and what always cracked me up is they have 30, the average has 13.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:16):**  They probably have a dually.  They have a 30 foot stock trailer to get every cow they own on.  They have a $6,000 shoot.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:25):**  They have a handling.  I mean, all that stuff that we didn't have when we had 150 cows, but, um, it's just different.  You know, we're, we're just completely opposite.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:34):**  We're the oddballs.  I think some people want to be in it as a hobby and have some of the lifestyle and they  have a town job to support it.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:43):**  And you know, there's some people that all they want to do is all they want to do is  livestock and in exchange for being able to live that life and you know, 30 year old pickup  and old broke down rusty two horse trailer.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:56:56):**  And they're just happy as hell every day.  Sounds like our truck to 99 with 326,000 miles on it.  Well, it's just broke in, isn't it?  
**[0:57:05-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:05):**  Uh, the engine runs great.  Everything else is falling apart.  Yeah.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:09):**  I tell everybody gets lighter every time I drive it because pieces fall off.  Must be a Dodge then right?  Nope.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:15):**  It's a Ford.  Used to be a Dodge guy until I got that truck.  I love that truck.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:21):**  It just gets up and goes every day.  Well, when we need it, we don't need it that often.  So we just have a 16 foot trailer and all that stuff works for us.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:29):**  If I need bigger stuff, hold, I hire it done.  It makes a lot of sense.  If you know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to have, you know, a 28 or 30 foot stock  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:38):**  trailer when I need it twice a year.  So exactly.  That's exactly right.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:42):**  I've got buddies that I have friends that I own them that I can go beg borrowers to  steal from, you know, and it helps to have a list because not everybody will always let  you borrow a trailer.  
**[0:57:51-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:57:51):**  But, uh, yeah, I just ran through that when we got those 19 head, we had dropped him.  Another guy, friend of ours took 60 head of that load and I've got, we got the rest of  them and I couldn't get, you know, in a 16 foot trailer, I couldn't get them all in.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:05):**  So I called a buddy and called another buddy, but they're all of course, planning corner,  planning beans.  So I just hold two loads, no big deal.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:12):**  I took an extra little extra time, but no, you can't always just have.  Everything.  You have to kind of limit that stuff.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:22):**  So what's Jeff's number one tip to make the world a better place?  Eliminate subsidies.  Well, that was easy.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:33):**  It is just think about how our world would change us, especially trying to get more land  that opened everything up.  Right.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:43):**  What was that CK?  I feel like that's cutting out the middleman.  We can't compete with what they can, what they get paid.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:58:53):**  I mean, we can't compete, degrace that land, you know, put fence on and do all that.  When they're paying $200 for land that we can only pay, afford to pay a hundred.  And then, you know, of course we can look at the high cost of labor and it's only going  
**[0:59:10-0:59:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:10):**  up and it doesn't seem like anybody wants to pay more at the grocery store for meat,  butter and eggs.  We can eliminate a lot of that labor by letting nature do stuff, you know, and moving your  
**[0:59:21-0:59:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:21):**  cows doesn't take a whole lot of labor.  I hear people just laughing at me all the time.  Well, you move your cows.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:28):**  At that time we moved them twice a day.  We don't do that anymore.  Usually once a day.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:32):**  But well, how's, you know, how do you do that?  But I see them hauling hay out to him every day.  How long does that take and how much diesel fuel does that take?  
**[0:59:40-0:59:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:40):**  That's labor to me because that's not something I like to do.  I like to open up the fence and watch the cows go through and set up another fence.  It doesn't take long at all, but everybody's different.  
**[0:59:52-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=0:59:52):**  You know, I would definitely agree with that.  I mean, I spend, I spend several hours a day out with my cows every day.  Getting ahead, running fences ahead, moving the mineral.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:03):**  That doesn't take any time.  No.  You know, I have time for things that I enjoy.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:07):**  I can go out and I can just drive through or walk through my cows every day and be able  to spend a couple hours with them and get right down there personal with them and watch  what they're eating and watch and just watch them for a couple hours and see how they're  
**[1:00:21-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:21):**  moving through the pasture and how they're using the forage.  And oh man, I'm glad I don't have to jump in that feed truck and go haul six more bales  over here, then go get my corn planter ready.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:31):**  And then, you know, so as the corn's in the dirt, got to get the camper and a boat ready  to go to the lake.  I just like going out and messing with my cows every day.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:40):**  And I'll say this, and I haven't said this on air yet.  Last year I kind of got away from that too much.  I got away from spending time with my cows every day and my mental health suffered.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:00:54):**  And this year now that I'm back into the habit of spending several mornings a week  out with my cows for a couple hours, I feel a lot better.  I think there's a lot of us that were just built to be with livestock.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:10):**  I agree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:13):**  We were custom grazing for a guy that had 12 cows, something like that.  Well, actually he was 11 and a horse.  Not a big fan of horses, never been a horse guy.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:22):**  So I was not unhappy when that horse left with the rest, but that was his thing.  He was actually going through a big custody battle with his daughter who was only like  four or five years old.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:31):**  And he said him leaving work and coming out and just watching his cows at our place was  way better than any therapy he could ever go to.  And that's what he did.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:41):**  When he had time, he'd just come out and watch the cows.  So let's talk about, let's circle around and talk about some of your failures because  I like to describe a fail as first attempt in learning.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:01:53):**  So what are some of your fails and what have they taught you?  There's been plenty.  We had a livestock partnership we got into, which ended up being a big fail.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:02:09):**  That was the first time that we really had, we didn't have land.  We don't have family land to go to or anything like that.  So we had been looking for somewhere to do something, cows, whatever.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:02:20):**  And we ended up getting hooked up with the local organic grain farmer.  And we started a partnership and the partnership never really got off the ground.  We wanted to control the money and whatever, but we, well, like I had been watching Gabe  
**[1:02:34-1:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:02:34):**  Brown YouTube videos for four years before we got that place.  So I had, I had to figure it out in my head how to do it.  I had nowhere to do it.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:02:42):**  So we did learn from that, that our management works, our management style works.  Just the person we tried to do that with did not work.  So now we've basically learned from that too, that we never want to be in a partnership  
**[1:02:55-1:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:02:55):**  again.  Talking about controlling everything that happens just makes complete sense and understand  why we did it.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:03:03):**  And I know we would probably, you know, same situation.  I'd probably try it again, you know, back then, but it just didn't work for us.  Actually, you know, we were just talking about Bob Kimford.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:03:15):**  That was a failure for us.  And I think it was because it was so wet, like we had so much moisture here.  I could get the cows to graze exactly like he said, but we could never get them to, you  
**[1:03:27-1:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:03:27):**  know, to work the grass, I guess you'd say fast enough to move to the next place.  So we were actually getting, what would you, we were like under grazing one paddock while  the next one's blowing up.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:03:39):**  And we could just never get it to work for us.  I mean, from that, we learned that we kind of have to do, he called it recreational fencing.  But for us that, that works too.  
**[1:03:53-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:03:53):**  He complained about it a lot.  I was like, well, you're not doing it.  It's not like it's, you know, four hours a day, we're moving to, well, see at that time  
**[1:04:02-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:02):**  we had say 250, 260 head total with calves and everything because they finished this  on the part in the partnership.  And we could move them all.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:13):**  And we're moving twice a day, I can move them all in an hour and 15 minutes, you know, for  the whole day.  So it wasn't a lot of wasted time there.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:21):**  But  And that's including building, doing all the recreational fencing.  Yeah, yeah, just doing the fencing is what it took us.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:29):**  But I don't know that he'd ever been around this area, like in the east with the moisture  we have and the growth that we get compared to out west, where I'm the opposite.  I know here, but I don't know out there.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:41):**  I know how to make a lot of stuff work in a dry, sandy, arid environment.  But if I go to Ohio, I probably would have have not much of an idea what I was doing  or what grasses I was looking at.  
**[1:04:52-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:04:52):**  Yeah, that brings up an interesting story when we went to the we drove up, we have short  horns, and we really liked the short horns.  We have a few registered  
**[1:05:01-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:01):**  horn cows matter.  What's that?  Horned cows matter?  
**[1:05:05-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:05):**  Yeah, we don't have horns.  My wife won't let me use a horn bull.  So we went out to the National Western in Denver, like three years ago, and we drove  
**[1:05:16-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:16):**  because we're cheap.  So we rented this car, drove it out there.  And I'm driving through all these fields and like, this is insane.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:22):**  I can't see a house.  There's no cross fencing.  What is going on here?  
**[1:05:26-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:26):**  Huge, huge pastures.  Sounds like Western Kansas.  Yes, it was Kansas.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:31):**  I mean, just there's nothing like nothing there, but green stuff.  But it was like two inches tall.  And I just couldn't get grasped that that would be that way.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:39):**  So I've made some call.  I actually got on, you know, like land and farm, the real estate thing was like, oh,  I could buy that for, you know, nothing.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:47):**  But then I found out how many acres it took.  So it was actually more expensive there than it was here.  Because we have a lot more production.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:05:53):**  But it was just one of those learning things too.  I think of another fail story.  That's a that's the ones that come to my mind right now.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:06:05):**  Okay.  So what's the other side of the coin?  What inspires you to be your best self?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:06:11):**  Sounds like a therapy session here.  What inspires me is just doing what I love to do.  I mean, that's that's what gets me going in the morning.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:06:26):**  And with the partnership, we had trouble.  I mean, like, marital issues with my wife and I because we weren't both involved.  Now we are both involved.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:06:40):**  And that really makes day to day life a lot a lot better for us, because we both like  doing that stuff and that really works for us.  Awesome, even though she has a business too, and she's actually stuck in Chicago doing  
**[1:06:55-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:06:55):**  that business.  She does puppy transport.  So she's waiting on a puppy to come in from the Ukraine that was supposed to be here today,  
**[1:07:02-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:02):**  and it's not coming till tomorrow.  I didn't know that your wife was was living and working in Chicago.  I kind of maybe want to apologize for the dig.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:11):**  The day she was just out there to pick it up.  She lives here.  Okay.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:16):**  Well, that makes it a little bit better.  At least she's there with you and not stuck several hours away.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:23):**  So, well, Jeff, we're kind of a little short on time today.  Have we left anything on the table?  Is there anything you'd like?  
**[1:07:33-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:33):**  Any questions you'd like me or CK to answer for you?  I just wanted to say that I really liked the episode with CK, seeing all, you know, hearing  all that.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:43):**  That was pretty inspiring to me to hear all that.  But I don't really have any questions that I can go off the top of my head.  Thank you.  
**[1:07:52-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:07:52):**  For our listeners here, we're doing this on a Zoom call and you should just seen CK's  face light up.  No, I mean, I was really nervous to do that episode.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:03):**  We talked about it for several months, actually.  And I was like, I know this is what they want, but if I'm going to do it, I'm going to share  everything.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:10):**  And it, when it aired, I got some really good messages as well, just like what you're saying.  So it kind of was like a sigh of relief to finally get that off my chest.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:22):**  For me, it was kind of neat too, because I had a friend growing up that came from almost  the same type of situation.  And nowadays you would have no clue that that happened because he just doesn't tell people.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:32):**  I kind of, I kind of feel like he might be better if he did, but you know, that's, that's  his thing.  He doesn't tell anybody about it.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:38):**  Yeah, and I don't think that there's anybody that thinks less of you, CK, for sharing your  story.  On the contrary, I think you've, I think you're starting to build a fan base because you are  
**[1:08:50-1:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:50):**  willing to be vulnerable and share.  Definitely.  Yeah, I agree.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:08:56):**  I don't have the courage yet to do that, but maybe we'll get there in season two this fall.  Well, Jeff, I really want to thank you for joining us today and you know, CK's still  stuck in Idaho.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:09:12):**  Hopefully by the next episode, she'll be back in the land of better service and we'll be  back to a good team.  So Jeff, thanks for having me.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:09:21):**  We really want to thank you for joining us today.  Thank you for your valuable insight on Organic Valley and the dairy industry.  And hopefully we'll be following us up with another dairy episode, maybe two in the near  
**[1:09:33-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:09:33):**  future.  Okay, sounds great.  Well, thanks again, Jeff, and have a great day.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:09:39):**  Well guys, I sure hope you enjoyed that episode with Jeff.  We've got at least two more great dairy episodes coming up.  Next week, my friend Lloyd Bortrager, the guy I was talking about that I visited his

**[1:10:01-1:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:10:01):**  And he is Iowa dairy farmer on TikTok.  And if you're on TikTok, I encourage you to go check him out.  He's very informative and very knowledgeable.

They're going to talk about the work that they're doing on the legislative side of things  with the government and trying to get some lobbyists on our side with regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/18-Jeff-Ramseyer-Organic-Valley-Dairy-Co-Op-e1331oh#t=1:10:35):**  And we also dive into carbon economics and their work with the Maasai tribe in Africa.

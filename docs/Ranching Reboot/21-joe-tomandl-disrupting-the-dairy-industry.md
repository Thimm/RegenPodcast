**[0:00:56-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:00:56):**  Today we're going to continue our dairy series with an amazing guest that's got a very interesting  program to try to start rebooting the grazing culture in the dairy industry.  Please welcome to the show, Joe Tumondal.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:10):**  So Joe, thanks for being with us today.  Welcome to the show.  Hey, great to be here.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:16):**  Thanks a lot for having me.  I've been a fan of your podcasts and looking forward to visiting for an hour.  Or an hour and a half, whatever you got today.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:26):**  Well, however long we want to go.  I don't know, I've had a couple of people kind of get a little cross with me because  we released a couple that were only an hour and they're like, hey, it was only an hour.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:39):**  Where's the other half of it?  We've got to work around their schedule.  It's just all we have sometimes.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:45):**  Yep.  So Joe, tell us about who you are, where you're at, and a little bit about your background  if you can.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:01:54):**  Well, sure, sure.  We can jump in at it.  So I live in North Central Wisconsin, grew up here on a small dairy farm.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:02:02):**  And actually the dairy farm started grazing cattle in the 80s as soon as my folks farm.  I went to school to become an agriculture instructor.  I met my wife, which were both ag teachers for several years and vocational FFA advisors  
**[0:02:19-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:02:19):**  also.  So we did that for, I think I did that for four years.  And they came back to my home neighborhood and purchased a farm and just a very modest  
**[0:02:28-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:02:28):**  farm to get started with about 30 cows, 30, 40 cows.  And really managed grazing is what brought us back and what allowed us to come back just  simply because of the business model, the economic model of it.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:02:41):**  You know, you're able to purchase a dairy that wasn't heavily invested in infrastructure.  We didn't have to have a ton of equipment.  So we could really use our limited equity, which we have limited equity in purchasing  
**[0:02:56-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:02:56):**  cattle, which are probably the most appreciable type of a thing and really focus on managing  grass for as many days as you possibly can and just all of the efficiencies that managed  grazing brings.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:03:08):**  So that brought us to the farm in 1998 is where we got started.  And you know, the farms, well, they grew over time.  So you know, by 2010, you know, jump into this piece of it, by 2010, the farm was about  
**[0:03:22-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:03:22):**  150 cows.  We're fairly seasonal yet and very much of a grazing based type of a system, shipping  milk conventionally.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:03:31):**  And when we looked at it at that point in our career, we says, okay, how do we keep  investing into a managed grazing dairy?  Because obviously the efficiencies we don't want to give up are dry matter going through  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:03:45):**  those cows on grass.  And you know, we run 70, 75% dry matter through those cows and that's what we want to keep  doing.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:03:53):**  So if we would have done what you know, the industry standard was or what we learned in  college, we would have doubled the size of that farm and we would have gone to 300 cows.  We had about a 320 acre grazing platform at that time.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:04:07):**  And you know, we could have bumped her up to 300 cows.  It would have worked.  Economically, it would have worked.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:04:12):**  You know, we would have dumped in, you know, and invested more money into milking systems,  you know, cattle facilities, manure storage.  And but you know, the numbers still would have worked.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:04:25):**  And then as we looked ahead to say, okay, so if we do that, fine.  But really our dry matter from grass is going to come down.  So our cost of production is most likely going to go up.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:04:35):**  Our feed costs are going to go up and we might have, you know, 40, 50% dry matter from grass  coming into them.  So but then as you look at the progression of dairy and of the business and to scale  
**[0:04:50-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:04:50):**  through the status quo, about seven years, you probably have to double that again.  So you take that 300 cow dairy and you add another 300 cows on and you call the concrete  trucks and the engineers and you put on facilities and more feedbunk storage and more manure  
**[0:05:05-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:05):**  storage and et cetera, et cetera.  And you know how that train has started.  So then there we'd be at 600 cows and maybe 20% dry matter coming from grass if that,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:16):**  and we're really going to change our whole model.  And the reality is, by the time we're ready to retire, we probably would have doubled  it again and you'd have a 1200 cow setup.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:26):**  There'd probably be zero grass on the platform.  Maybe you'd run heifers out there.  It would look a whole different system is what it would look like.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:35):**  And you may have $10 million in infrastructure, in concrete and feed manure storage and cattle  housing that's depreciating there.  And then when I'm ready to cash out or when we're ready to cash out, we're still not,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:48):**  it's big.  You can maybe turn it to the next generation, but it'd be difficult, but I guarantee it'd  be very difficult to turn it to the second generation.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:05:57):**  But typically our buyer for something like that would have been either very large dairy  or very large cropping agriculture.  And we'd most likely sell the whole thing, lock stock and barrel, house included, leave  
**[0:06:09-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:06:09):**  with the dog and it would be over.  And then you've got everything else, tax implications and everything that would go with that.  So long story short, in 2010, as we looked at that using grass, the mindset, we said,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:06:24):**  you know, instead of doubling this thing, why don't we take these efficiencies and duplicate  it?  Because there are in these rural neighborhoods, there are these 200 acre farms, 150, 200,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:06:37):**  300 acre farms.  And they don't have successors necessarily.  And they are ripe for coming into and converting them to a managed grazing system and running  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:06:51):**  them as efficiently as we possibly can.  It's a whole different management system.  That's even human resources and employee management and everything.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:06:59):**  But it works.  So that's what we did.  So in 2010, we duplicated and built another 150 cow dairy.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:07:07):**  And subsequently, we just set up another one here last year.  So we've got three of these, they're 150 to 200 cow units that we've got.  So the idea is, you know, maybe we'll milk 1000 cows someday, it just isn't going to  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:07:23):**  be in one location.  Right.  And then when we're ready to retire, rather than selling the whole thing, lock stock and  
**[0:07:29-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:07:29):**  barrel, can we actually slowly divest out of this beast?  And can each one of those things live on its own, not be too big of an investment where  a family cannot afford it?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:07:42):**  And then if we're really good, can we even be the bank for one of those things and slowly  transition out of it?  So I mean, this may go through the retirement in different equity earnings, sure milking  
**[0:07:52-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:07:52):**  type of systems.  And then at the end of the day, can we leave 234 upper middle class independent businesses  in the neighborhood, you know, versus, you know, a different profile of agriculture in  
**[0:08:08-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:08:08):**  the neighborhood, because when you have these small businesses, and when you've got the  opportunities for independent people to own these businesses and be the stewards of the  land, it's a real win win win type of thing, just in the economic impact of buying products,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:08:25):**  supply services, to, you know, kids attending schools to providing leadership in the communities.  And then there's just a whole variety of things, I think that are terribly important.  In even in agriculture, in general, when we look at how vertically integrated the things  
**[0:08:42-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:08:42):**  are, I think we need to look at these decentralized systems of scale.  You're not looking at, you know, how can we make these efficient, and these are some of  the things that we're looking at here.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:08:55):**  So that's, that's where I'm at on the dairy background.  You know, what we've also done and what we can visit about a little bit too is about  that 2010, you know, and really looking at these rural communities, and okay, what's  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:09:07):**  happening to them?  You know, yes, there's still there's jobs in there, you know, agriculture is getting  bigger and bigger, it's getting more consolidated.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:09:15):**  And in what what is happening to rural communities?  And what's happening to these farms?  And how do you slow that down, then how do you stop it?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:09:26):**  And really, if you could take a look at what is the solution to it, and it's really managed  grazing and regenerative type of agriculture that potentially do it, and is it this business  model that could do it?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:09:36):**  So what is holding us back from that?  People, people, people, people run, and it is the key skilled people, empowered people,  people with opportunities are so important.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:09:51):**  So when you look at the management structure of a 200 cow managed grazing dairy, for instance,  it isn't like a 2000 cow dairy.  You've got to bring an individual on there that doesn't know just the nutrition doesn't  
**[0:10:06-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:10:06):**  know just the herd health or the reproductive piece.  In large dairy, we're actually able to come in just like an industrial model and break  out and chunk out pieces of these and create full time jobs for people just focus on them.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:10:23):**  Manage grazing, regenerative type of agriculture, you need an individual who can come in there  and understand grass, who can understand soils, who can understand cow health and in human  resources, and, and can fix the stuff that they broke at the end of the day.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:10:41):**  So you really need that individual that is really wearing a lot of hats again.  So the problem is you can't teach this in a classroom.  You can't teach it in a post secondary institution or institutional higher education.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:10:55):**  These are things that you just did.  This comes from a teaching background.  There are some things you just need to experience to learn.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:11:02):**  So how do you train that next generation of farmers?  Let's take a chapter out of the playbook of the guilds, and that's registered apprenticeship.  So the best trainers are the people that have done this for 20 years.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:11:14):**  Those are your experts in all reality.  They're the ones that are going to tell you where those cows need to go, what the weather  patterns look like.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:11:22):**  You know, how to balance the proper nutrition with animal health, how to find the markets,  how to deal with your local infrastructure and supply and service people.  Where are you going to find the human resource profile that you need?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:11:37):**  These are the people with the boots on the ground that are really going to be able to  teach you how to do it and teach you how to do it in your region.  Because there is no cookie cutter in agriculture and production agriculture and there shouldn't  
**[0:11:50-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:11:50):**  be.  Everything changes and it's different and every region is different.  So in 2010, we worked on coming together and creating a registered apprenticeship and managed  
**[0:12:04-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:12:04):**  grazing dairy to really try to create that platform for individuals that want to get  involved in dairy farming, learn more in dairy farming, whether it be a management level  or all the way up to ownership level.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:12:18):**  And then to create that platform for farmers that we're looking at not only bringing on  good managers or good people onto their farm, but to find that equity earner or that potential  person that could take over their farm.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:12:34):**  And we created on that platform of registered apprenticeship.  So it started in Wisconsin and we pulled together industry people and farmers and created a  complete set of curriculum.  
**[0:12:48-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:12:48):**  So we did a full blown day come at developing a curriculum around this.  And it's odd, this was the first one in agriculture, which is surprising.  As old as agriculture is, this is the first actual registered apprenticeship anywhere  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:13:03):**  in agriculture.  And paid, right?  So that's also what surprised me.

**[0:13:18-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:13:18):**  educational type of a platform.  So the apprenticeship turned into a two year, 4,000 hour training.  Paid training while you're on that dairy farm.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:13:32):**  About 3,700 hours follow an actual job book or training guidelines.  But that is a physical book that you can sit down with your mentor farmer and go through  and you check off everything from enterprise budgets to raising calves to equipment maintenance  
**[0:13:48-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:13:48):**  to parlor management to whatever it may be and we've got it all fleshed out in there.  And then 300 hours of it are related instruction, which is actual classroom work.  And the classroom work is taking place on a platform that we pulled together called  
**[0:14:04-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:14:04):**  the Managed Grazing Innovation Center.  And the Managed Grazing Innovation Center is its own entity basically, which provides  virtual instruction in regenerative managed grazing dairy.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:14:15):**  And it provides us the classes that we require for the registered apprenticeship.  So at this point, Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship is in 15 states.  So in 2015, we took it national and we registered with the Federal Department of Labor and we  
**[0:14:35-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:14:35):**  built a complete cloud-based website to manage it, to manage mentor and apprentice pairs  as well as a component on that website to really try to match individuals that wanted  to get into managed grazing dairy as well as farmers that were looking to employ somebody.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:14:54):**  So we don't actually place people, but we provide that platform where a dairy farmer  can go out and hire an individual because first these are employees and then we bring  them to a much more structured workforce training program.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:15:09):**  So that's a little bit about me and that's where we're at right now today with kind of  a balance of the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship taking plenty of time and it's very exciting  and then dabbling a little bit in some dairy farming too.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:15:23):**  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  You wear lots of hats.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:15:26):**  So do you get lots of demand for the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship?  We do.  So we've got at most time between 175 and 200 individuals that are on our website that  
**[0:15:38-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:15:38):**  will put a profile on it.  And then we're right up around 200 dairy farms that are approved.  So in order for a dairy farm to get approved to the actual apprenticeship, a farmer will  
**[0:15:54-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:15:54):**  come to the platform and say, yep, I've got a profile of managed grazing dairy and I'm  very interested in either bringing an existing employee through or to try to find somebody  that I can hire on as an employee and bring them through a more systematic workforce training  
**[0:16:11-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:16:11):**  type of a program.  So once we bring those individuals together, and actually each farm is approved, so we've  got education coordinators who are basically field staff out in all the regions where we  
**[0:16:24-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:16:24):**  work with and we work with administrative partners from NGOs to university that are  helping in these regions.  But yes, each of these farms are approved and then they come to the platform and then  
**[0:16:39-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:16:39):**  we help them try to find that right employer, that individual, and then provide the actual  oversight and the training.  How many apprentices do you have per year do you think?  
**[0:16:54-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:16:54):**  Right now I think we have 44 apprentices that are for the program.  And they're coming in and out, we've graduated, I think we're right up against 50 that we've  graduated.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:17:08):**  And it's an intense program, it's not like taking a class for a week.  You know, this is-  Thousands of hours?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:17:15):**  It's pretty real, it's full time work, it is full on dairying, it's dirty, it's long  days, it's short days, it's cold weather, it is, you know, everything, I mean, we're  really trying to give these individuals the experience.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:17:32):**  And we do it for two years also, so that an individual could see at least two years of  a managed grazing season, because obviously there's no standard year, every single one  changes, I've been in this for 20 years and every one is different.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:17:47):**  So it's just a little bit of a taste into, you know, what this business is really looking  like.  So if I wanted to sign myself up as an apprentice, where would I go?  
**[0:17:58-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:17:58):**  I go to your website, what is-  Yup, you go, you can just Google dairy grazing apprenticeship or else type right into your  browser, dga-national.org, so dga-national.org.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:18:14):**  What's the process?  Is it like a time of year that you look to fill in applicants or is it as needed basis,  is it seasonal?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:18:25):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  And because of the platform, people can enter on and exit whenever and wherever they want,  really.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:18:35):**  So we do have a lot more of a surge that comes in in the springtime as people are looking  for, you know, summertime type, because obviously, you know, still a lot of the farms are fairly  seasonal, so you've got that springtime type of a flush where you're calving and you're  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:18:51):**  getting your paddock set up and everything going.  So that's usually when people start looking.  So there's a few more that will come on then.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:18:57):**  But we get them throughout the year.  And we get them in all age ranges too, which is really great to see because as a registered  apprenticeship, you typically need to have a high school diploma and be 18 years of age.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:19:11):**  So we've got everybody from that level all the way up to mid 20s, young families, and  then even up to second career individuals that have always wanted to get into dairy  and just haven't really had that, I call it a platform or that path.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:19:29):**  Opportunity almost too.  Yeah.  And it's not a silver bullet for everybody.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:19:35):**  I mean, it's still, it takes plenty.  You know, we still have about a 40% attrition rate of individuals.  Okay.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:19:44):**  That was my next question.  Yeah.  It's just, it's the nature of the beast.  
**[0:19:48-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:19:48):**  But you know, when you look at registered apprenticeship through all the industries,  you know, they do figure about 50, sometimes up to 60% of an attrition rate of people that  just don't make it through all the steps in completing the whole program.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:20:04):**  It shows that it, even somebody that doesn't make it through in many cases, that's still  a success because you've got an individual that was able to test the waters and try this  before they dove into, you know, $500,000 beginning farmer loan and went in up to their  
**[0:20:22-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:20:22):**  eyeballs and it's something they didn't know exactly what they're doing.  So yeah, total win-win.  I think even, you know, spending X amount of dollars on a degree.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:20:32):**  So like mine is in animal science and plant science.  And I have friends who did the same thing with me in, you know, five plus years later,  they are doing nothing in animal science because they decided they hated the, you know, livestock  
**[0:20:47-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:20:47):**  production world and they'd rather, you know, work a city job.  And so I think it's, it is like, you don't realize what you're committing to because  it looks good on paper, but when you actually have to do the, it's different.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:01):**  Were you going to say it, Brian?  Do you think that's because of the way the education system worked and, and what that  exposed you to as far as agriculture while you're in college?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:13):**  Yeah, I also, yes, so I do, but I also think that I forced myself to be exposed to like  hard work.  Yeah, so I do.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:23):**  I do think that it depends on how much you're willing to like really learn what you want  to do.  I think, not to brag on any of my friends who are listening to this, but I think that  
**[0:21:35-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:35):**  you think that you're just going to be handed opportunities instead of have to work for  them because you have a degree.  And I think there's a sense of entitlement with some people where it's like, you're not  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:46):**  going to get handed this senior level nutrition job out of college.  Like it's just not going to happen.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:21:52):**  I can agree with that.  I mean, I kind of, I kind of agree with that mindset, you know, that that was a myth that  they were really pushing when, you know, our generation was in college, like, oh, you'll  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:04):**  never get a good job if you don't get a degree.  And if you get a degree, you're, you'll get a good job.  I even remember one time that was like, if you did get a degree, your chances of getting  
**[0:22:12-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:12):**  a job that make over a hundred thousand dollars a year, you know, this much percent better.  And it's almost like everybody rushed to college and got degrees and it's saturated now.  And a lot of the, a lot of the things that we're realizing that we need in the world,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:27):**  like grazing dairy and, you know, regenerative agriculture, that just hasn't been, you know,  there's no education system and there's no, there's no training pipeline to start producing  these people.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:41):**  Technical assistance too, right?  So like the Guild model that Joe, you mentioned, like it just is non-existent anywhere in agriculture.  So yeah.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:52):**  Yeah.  You're, you're a hundred percent correct.  I think those are really things you see.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:22:56):**  And it always, you know, we could arguably say it always was existed.  It was just intergenerational.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:03):**  So, you know, but then if you don't have that intergenerational successor, uh, now what  do you do?  And I think that's really what we're diving into.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:14):**  We're trying to create some of those solutions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:18):**  That too.  And, uh, what I think is common and please correct me if I'm wrong, but usually dairy  families who are raised that way, a lot of times they don't want to continue the business,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:32):**  right?  They want to go do their own thing is what I'm hearing.  And so there's people like me who wasn't raised in agriculture, who I see the culture and  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:41):**  the lifestyle and I like it and that's my opportunity and I want to create that.  So does that make sense?  What I said?  
**[0:23:49-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:23:49):**  Yeah, I think there is something to that.  And I think in getting back to some things that Brian talked about, and it's just some  of the status quo about, okay, you go to college, you get a real job.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:24:01):**  This really felt like it was a lot of the underlying advice that was coming from so  many farm families.  And they're like, you know what?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:24:12):**  My kids are going to be successful and success doesn't mean staying on this farm.  It means you go out and get a real job.  You go get an education and they measured success by getting those kids onto that next  
**[0:24:26-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:24:26):**  level onto the real job.  Uh, and, and two things there is, you know, I think the dairy industry has propagated  that a little bit, you know, as it's developed over the years, unintentionally, I mean, dairy  
**[0:24:40-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:24:40):**  industry is incredibly successful.  And it's very streamlined and very efficient.  But I think underneath that, that has closed a lot of doors for a lot of this entrepreneurial  
**[0:24:55-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:24:55):**  mindset.  It has closed some of these doors for allowing individuals to get involved or wanting to  get involved.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:25:06):**  I think those are just some of the things that we're seeing there.  I mean, dairy is, it's transitioned and it's scaling so much.  And I think that's, I think the problems are several fold.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:25:20):**  There's a fairly high barrier of entry due to, you know, regulatory burden, regulatory  costs and whatnot.  Well, yeah, and a couple of things.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:25:30):**  So, you know, getting back and then, and then we can talk to some of these barriers to entry  too, is, you know, getting back to education.  And I do like talking about education too a little bit too.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:25:43):**  But I do think that when we look at this, this apprenticeship type of education or skilled  workforce type of education, there's a huge need for it.  And it is something that is becoming a little bit more status quo, which is nice to see  
**[0:25:59-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:25:59):**  because I think we've seen what happens if, you know, we don't have that workforce trained  in some of these skilled type of trades are incredibly important.  And they can be very worthwhile, very gratifying, not only personally, but even financially  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:26:15):**  too.  And I think our generations of workers need to realize that.  So I think there's a ton of opportunities, you know, within this.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:26:22):**  And especially when you look at the registered apprenticeship type of a world, I mean, they  say, earn while you learn.  That's a big deal.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:26:30):**  I don't know if we're ever going to see it in dairy where you're going up to different  pay grades based on, you know, the things, the skill sets that you've learned.  You know, we're not there.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:26:41):**  You know, dairy is very immature when it comes to an agriculture, when it comes to recognizing  the importance of skilled skilled trades.  So, you know, just to run the apprenticeship and hopefully we'll get there.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:26:53):**  You know, that is kind of a dream to get there.  In a lot of the guilds, it is the industry, you know, that basically supports these training  programs.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:27:02):**  I mean, you know, a lot of these apprenticeships, I mean, the industry is throwing in to create  these multimillion dollar training centers because they realize the importance of it.  And in checkoff money would come into it, you know, through either union wages or just  
**[0:27:20-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:27:20):**  played part of, you know, the trade that you're involved in and they invest into that next  generation.  You know, we're not there with dairy yet, obviously, and I think we're a long ways away  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:27:31):**  from it.  But in all reality, should it happen?  I absolutely think so.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:27:36):**  I don't see why, you know, part of a checkoff, ten cents or whatever is going out there.  Why shouldn't two of that go to training that next generation?  You know, why should mentor trainers be throwing a bone for that?  
**[0:27:52-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:27:52):**  Why couldn't we offer free classes for that and just do a much more systematic approach  of bringing in that next generation of dairy?  The important thing, though, that we really want to do is to bring in this type of a dairy  
**[0:28:13-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:28:13):**  farmer also.  I think this regenerative type of a dairy farmer is very important to bring in the mix  of things.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:28:23):**  Not that one has got to be better than the other or one better than the other.  Let's just not let's not go there.  But let's just look at it from a strength of the industry and a diversity of management  
**[0:28:35-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:28:35):**  type of practices and a diversity of consumers and what they want.  And why not give it to them?  I mean, if we're going to do dairy, let's let's give them that, you know, type of product  
**[0:28:46-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:28:46):**  that they're looking for.  Not that it is bashing another type of product within the right.  Let's give them let's give them what they want.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:28:56):**  So I think there's a huge amount of entrepreneurial opportunities within there to do that.  And we need to really look at and develop the sector.  So I think that's where where the sector could really bring value.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:09):**  Oh, yeah.  I mean, beef needs this really badly.  So it almost sounds like when you do a beef grazing apprenticeship.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:16):**  So Brian and I will be kidding.  No, I've got way too much to do.  I can't I can't head up that program.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:24):**  But somebody listening to this podcast needs to start a regenerative beef grazing apprenticeship  program.  Yeah, well, there's a few.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:34):**  So the Quivira coalition.  Yeah, they do really good jobs.  They do a nice job.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:41):**  I don't know if that one is registered.  There's informal and there's formal.  You know, there are a few more registered apprenticeships that are popping up.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:51):**  Hasa in Pennsylvania and they're one of our administrative partners that give them a shout  out also.  But they've created one in vegetable production.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:29:59):**  There's also been another vegetable production one created in Wisconsin here also.  And I don't know if Maine has got one too, but they're starting to pop up a little bit  more.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:10):**  And recently here also within the conventional dairy world, there's been some rumblings.  I've had some people reach out, you know, looking at how do you create that registered  type of apprenticeship just to create that more systematic approach to workforce training.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:26):**  And I can't agree more.  I think it's terribly important.  So you know, the other and not to just keep battling it, but we talked about some of those.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:37):**  My bad.  Sorry.  Oh, go ahead.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:40):**  Go ahead.  This is nice.  Because it's like any awkward pauses.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:44):**  Yeah, you're good.  You know, well, we talked a little bit on these barriers, you know, to getting into  farming.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:30:52):**  And I think that links into some of these conversations that we're just having in these  barriers that are getting in.  Yeah, there's regulatory barriers and that, but just the reality of what's happened to  
**[0:31:04-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:31:04):**  dairy, and dairy over the last even five, 10 years, and just the costs to get in.  And that is cost of everything from land, to buildings, to infrastructure, to equipment,  to human resources, everything.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:31:21):**  It's just I mean, though, the what you got to pony up to get in, just flat costs a lot  of money.  And as we're looking at even continuing to keep the next generation going in dairy, I  
**[0:31:36-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:31:36):**  think we need to take a really fearless look at, you know, the idea of scalability with  integrity.  Because as you look at a lot of these smaller dairies, and yeah, they may be in a value  
**[0:31:49-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:31:49):**  added or they may be in a market.  Now put that against a big mortgage payment.  If I was going to say, what are they passing on?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:31:59):**  Exactly.  You know, next generation.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:32:02):**  You know, I mean, let's let's really take that that a certain scale of dairy.  This is what's closing the doors of some of the berries.  It's very difficult to do it on 40 or 50 or 60 cows, even in an organic or an all grass  
**[0:32:16-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:32:16):**  market, because just flat, you don't have enough hundred weights to go around.  Even if your margin might be $10, a hundred weight, you still need more hundred weights  to pay for the four to $5,000 an acre land for the piece of equipment that costs where  
**[0:32:32-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:32:32):**  it used to be, you know, 20,000 is now $40,000.  Just the cost of family living keeps going up and up and up.  And I think we need to take a really close look at that.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:32:44):**  And even in a lot of our pricing formulas and our value added products, I think the  price for people can be profitable if they got the majority of it paid for.  I think if you really want to look at true sustainability, it needs to be priced at a  
**[0:32:58-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:32:58):**  spot where that thing can be transitioned, where you can put an actual debt load against  it.  And those are some things that that we need to look at.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:33:07):**  And that is, fortunately or unfortunately, where some of this drive and need to scale  comes from.  And that's so much why we've seen, you know, a lot of dairy and a lot of these industries  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:33:19):**  scale so much.  They just have to have enough units to spread all of that investment over.  Right.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:33:26):**  So yeah.  And so we had a previous episode that we released in this dairy series was with a conventional  dairy person, Dan.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:33:39):**  He does robotic milkers and, um, and he also has to support two to three different families.  And so him, his brother's family and kind of his dad, too.  So, you know, we were kind of trying to challenge his paradigm of like, maybe you could you  
**[0:33:58-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:33:58):**  can start grazing your replacement heifers and that's where you start.  And it just for him, it was like, it's just such a challenge for me to even want to make  that risk, because what am I going to lose?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:10):**  Right.  What would you say to that?  Go ahead, Brian, add on what you want.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:14):**  Well, you know, it, I would say he was more challenging us.  Well, yeah, right.  He was like, this is why I do what I do.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:22):**  Right.  And yeah, and, you know, kind of like we said last week, you know, all things are appropriate  in context.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:29):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, well, I tell you, you know, at a certain point, you basically need to pick the horse  
**[0:34:38-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:38):**  you're going to ride in a way.  And in all reality, when you've got that kind of an investment and we go through conversation,  a lot of conversations with people say, well, we're going to convert farmers over to manage  
**[0:34:52-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:52):**  grazing.  So we're going to take these large farms and I think we can convert them.  Several things are happening here.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:34:59):**  You know, number one is these farm like that you're so invested, capital-y and emotionally  too, but from a capital standpoint that you can't afford to unravel that.  It's just a nature of the beast.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:35:14):**  You know, when you start getting 10, 12, $15,000 in animals stuck in the land and equipment  and buildings and infrastructure, you need to turn milk pounds per hundred weight.  You can't unravel that model unless you've got the whole thing paid for and you want  
**[0:35:33-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:35:33):**  to jump into a different type of a market.  It's just economically, it's very difficult.  And where we're at with dairy is, you know, more and more people in this over the next  
**[0:35:42-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:35:42):**  last decade, even two decades, they've made that decision.  They've moved to that more intensive dairy model, that scale dairy model.  And I totally get it.  
**[0:35:52-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:35:52):**  I mean, the infrastructure is there.  The infrastructure in regards to the training, the education, the industry support, the cropping  systems and tools and equipment, it's all set up to do it.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:36:05):**  You know, I always made the comment that it's harder for me to go out and find that support  team to build a 200 cow managed grazing dairy than it would be to go out and build a 2000  cow dairy.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:36:20):**  There just are not, it's hard to do a feasibility study.  There are not the consultants, the planners, the HR type of oversight, the systems just  aren't necessarily in place.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:36:30):**  And it comes right down to even cropping and feed storage and so many of these resources  that are there, you know, they're there in scalable dairy.  They're not necessarily there in regenerative dairy.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:36:43):**  And I think those are some real voids.  And I call them opportunities that we need to be looking at, you know, down the road,  you know, with these types of farms.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:36:53):**  So yeah, so I would definitely, I understand exactly where these farmers, these business  people are.  It's hard to unravel that thing.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:37:04):**  And you just economically, it's very difficult and you can't do it.  And I think it's a valuable insight for the listeners who aren't in dairy and want to  make like maybe a judgment of like, why aren't you wanting to move to regenerative or like  
**[0:37:18-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:37:18):**  what's if you're losing profit by not being regenerative or, you know, other things.  And it's like, it's just not that easy.  It really isn't.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:37:29):**  Getting a place to start that makes sense on a scale that's manageable with your time  and labor commitments already, that's going to move the needle somehow, but at the same  time is also small enough that it can fail and not take you out of business.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:37:48):**  I was fortunate.  I found that.  I had that available on my ranch.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:37:54):**  And I get not everybody can.  Not everybody has that freedom to be able to say, oh, okay, well, I got this little  pasture over here that we can experiment in.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:38:05):**  If it's messed up, it's messed up and it's only 250 acres, not a big deal.  I get not everybody can do that.  But it's finding a place, a way for some of these conventional guys to start pulling that  
**[0:38:18-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:38:18):**  lever and start making a transition.  I think that's what we need to work on.  Yeah, here's some, yeah, a couple of other things too.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:38:29):**  I agree.  I think there's some potential there.  There's also something to be said that, and this is what we're trying to address with  
**[0:38:36-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:38:36):**  the apprenticeship also, is how do you break down these barriers and how do you bring them  in?  How do you address these issues?  
**[0:38:46-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:38:46):**  The tough thing with transitioning also is in getting farms to transition, and I hope  this isn't taken the wrong way necessarily either, but you've got farmers that are very  capital invested into a system and you've got them that are very emotionally invested  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:39:05):**  in also.  And it takes time.  It's your head around what this means.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:39:10):**  So even if you could unwind that from a business capital standpoint, it still takes time to  transition that.  The other reality is as we're looking at the solution to getting more people on the ground  
**[0:39:25-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:39:25):**  and manage grazing, and a lot of people look at it and say, okay, I think it's a matter  of converting a lot of farmers.  Okay, maybe.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:39:35):**  But the other reality is what's the average age of farmers?  It's like 58 years old.  It could take 10 years or higher.  
**[0:39:46-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:39:46):**  You may get somebody to convert it and they're at possibly toward the twilight of their career.  So you can invest a ton of money in there.  So this is what we looked at a little bit with the apprenticeship is let's start with  
**[0:40:00-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:40:00):**  the people that have got 25 years or 30 years of farming in front of them.  So let's just do a total reset on this thing and let's focus on the new farmers and the  beginning farmers and the transitioning type of farmers that aren't vested into a model.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:40:14):**  So just from a straight economic impact.  So where I would really like to see this all happen and where I would like to see acreage's  transition and this regenerative market sector be filled, it's with the next generation that  
**[0:40:29-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:40:29):**  have got this trajectory ahead of them.  So that's some of the strategies to the philosophy that we look at, well, a little bit with this  and that I think we can provide.  
**[0:40:41-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:40:41):**  Now when you look at breaking down some of these barriers too of land, cost of land,  I think that's where you need to look at some of these real business models out there of  okay how do you control an asset without having to bring that whole elephant on your balance  
**[0:41:01-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:41:01):**  sheet and buy the whole thing?  How do you do it?  So I think we need to very innovatively look forward here in regards to finance and innovative  
**[0:41:13-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:41:13):**  finance and how can this work?  Is it coming from traditional finance?  Is there a way for capital to come in and build an asset and hold an asset and lease  
**[0:41:24-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:41:24):**  an asset to a new farmer that's coming in or an existing farmer that's coming in for  a certain amount of years and then allow them to start buying it?  I think we really need to look at some of these financial type of mechanisms and instruments  
**[0:41:39-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:41:39):**  out there and we may need to build a good number of them.  If you look at countries that have got 20 plus thousand dollar an acre land value, some  of those pieces are in place and as we look at the Dairy Grazing and Crediship platform,  
**[0:41:59-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:41:59):**  some of the thoughts and the strategy with this is okay let's create that farmer network,  let's create that farmer network that has got the ability to build people, to build  skill sets, to identify the best of the best and to give them the opportunities they need  
**[0:42:16-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:42:16):**  because at the end of the day this is what's going to de-risk everything from capital to  environmental markets to consumer markets to whatever it may be to just plain land management.  So the idea now is okay can we go out there, can we build these innovative finance systems,  
**[0:42:33-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:42:33):**  can we build those funds that really want to see regenerative agriculture come in and  it may not be government policy, it may be full-on private type of investment capital  that may want to come into this with a level of integrity.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:42:49):**  This isn't a land grabbering like that but can we create those mechanisms which can hold  assets get a return on those assets while somebody gets the cash flow and the equity  together and is able to ultimately purchase that thing out.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:43:06):**  So these are models that we look at and are very interested in trying to create through  this systematic kind of a workforce training process because we're looking for the best  of the best that could come in and have gone through the rigors of a two-year program and  
**[0:43:26-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:43:26):**  probably more it's going to take than that obviously before they're ready to roll but  to have those types of opportunities and I think that's where you could start moving  the needle.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:43:35):**  So let's focus on this new generation, let's focus on business structures and infrastructure  within dairy and land management and even other livestock sectors and can we create  these finance mechanisms to get them that runway and get them going.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:43:54):**  So that's a piece of this and knowing people, people's worth derisking it.  Networking and people, connections is what's making this community work I think.  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:44:07):**  Absolutely.  So let's talk about, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about your dairy.  So what kind of cows do you have on your dairy?  
**[0:44:19-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:44:19):**  So we are running, we're mainly New Zealand, Friesian.  We've started a lot of different crosses, we've gone through a variety of different  things but predominantly New Zealand Friesian is what we're running on the dairies right  
**[0:44:32-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:44:32):**  now.  So there are these 1,100 pound, 1,200 pound cows designed, they're coming from grazing  based types of genetics.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:44:41):**  The farms are relatively seasonal, Bill, they're probably 80% of the calving is done in an  eight week window in the spring.  Because we are in these northern type of climates, it is a bit of a dance because we still need  
**[0:44:56-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:44:56):**  to have infrastructure, we still need to have facilities and buildings and so we will still  run a hall freshening type.  We still try to maximize grass as much as possible but you need to plan for that off  
**[0:45:09-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:45:09):**  season, you need to plan for winter.  Yeah, take Christmas off actually, right?  So that's kind of the profile on the farms, how they look with the cows.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:45:23):**  Again, very much a grazing platform.  So I've heard that there's some folks up in your part of the world that use mobile  milking parlors.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:45:33):**  Is that something you have any experience with?  Boy, I don't, those are tough.  It would be fun.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:45:40):**  I don't know of them right off hand.  They're tough to get through state inspection in many cases.  Number one is there isn't necessarily, there aren't the manufacturers, you got to go overseas  
**[0:45:51-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:45:51):**  to find them, to find a service and then get through the state inspection.  But that's the whole thing.  We're running, we'll still run a traditional swing parlor on the dairies is what we're  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:05):**  doing.  Okay, what is that?  Can you explain that because I have no idea what that is actually.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:10):**  Totally.  So what we're looking at with those parlors is you basically share one milking cluster  for both sides of the parlor.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:18):**  So it cuts a lot of you, it doesn't cut your equipment costs right in half, but it cuts  it down considerably and it allows you to put more stalls in the parlor.  So the way these things, and this is why the management is a fair amount different than  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:30):**  a lot of other dairy.  We want to get these cows turned and we want to get them back out on grass as soon as we  can.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:37):**  Get them out of here, get them in.  So we do try to put it in these efficient milking parlors where one or two people in  our family can jump in and knock milking out in an hour and a half.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:47):**  Right back out there.  So, so we'll do that.  So we've got, we run, the one farm is a swing 16 parlor and we can do right up about that  
**[0:46:55-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:46:55):**  hundred cows an hour and turn them and get them back out on grass.  The other is a swing 24 which will do that, you know, 125 cows per hour pretty easily.  The other one, actually the new farm has got a more traditional herringbone in it, but  
**[0:47:11-0:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:11):**  we are going to be converting that to a swing 16 and run those standard type of swing parlors.  A lot of these, this design has come out of New Zealand.  So we try to get as many ideas as we can out of the New Zealand management type of the  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:25):**  systems and bring them up here.  But that's where they're coming out of.  Why New Zealand?  
**[0:47:31-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:31):**  That's, they just got such a grazing footprint.  Right.  They make, their, their main management system is managed grazing and, uh, yeah.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:42):**  Yeah.  And they manage, so Brian, they manage the grass in kilojoules, right?  Isn't that based on energy metrics, which is amazing.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:52):**  Yeah.  Very intensively manage grass, you know?  And we're, we're pretty good at it.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:47:59):**  Uh, you know, up here in a lot of these different areas, uh, you know, they're from what I just  said, very good at all.  I mean, they're really, I mean, they're watching every kilogram of dry matter that they've  
**[0:48:08-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:48:08):**  got ahead of them, how much they're harvesting off and how many days of grass they've got  ahead.  Uh, and we're always watching that same thing too.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:48:16):**  You're always watching what's the next 20 days look like, because that is such a key  to setting up these grazing farms is you can't have everything growing at the same rate because  you're going to have incredibly lush, really good grass, you know, for a week.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:48:29):**  And then your whole farm's going to blow up and it's all going to look the same.  You're gonna have a bunch of, you know, funky STEMI grass.  Uh, and with dairy, you need to really, it takes an eye and you really need to have that  
**[0:48:40-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:48:40):**  good nutrition in front of them.  Uh, it's not as flexible, uh, and forgiving maybe as with grazing dry stock, either heifers  or young stock, or even some of the livestock, if you're not going right to finish on them,  
**[0:48:53-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:48:53):**  uh, because no immediately, you know, we just ran into that on our farms here too.  You know, we, some of this got a little far ahead of us and you could see it immediately  in the milk tank.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:49:03):**  Uh, so this is where you come in and you may drop a paddock, you may conventionally harvest  the paddock, uh, and use it for winter feed.  Uh, and it's just a matter of doing that dance to try to set things up so that you've got  
**[0:49:16-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:49:16):**  20 days of feed area or more, you know, obviously ideally, but it's all gotta be at different  stages of growth so that when you get it to it, it's at that optimum stage of growth.  That's the real art, you know, behind managed grazing.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:49:30):**  So what, what kind of forages are you managing or it doesn't sound like you're on, on native  grass.  It sounds like you're on planted forages most of the time.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:49:38):**  Yeah, so we'll run, there's a lot of just plain native bluegrass or June grass that  we have up here, uh, in, in a lot of these fields.  So there's a lot of that you just can't get away from there's, there's white clover in  
**[0:49:49-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:49:49):**  there too, but we'll come in and we try.  Try to run a lot of improved grasses and we'll no till in about a third of the ground every  year and we'll no till in, um, you know, a lot of your newer red clovers, white clovers,  
**[0:50:01-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:01):**  some that'll hopefully try to, uh, pull in a little bit more nitrogen.  Uh, and then we're using metal fast use, soft leaf fast use.  Um, yeah, we haven't been using a whole lot of orchard grass, uh, festoliums, uh, and  
**[0:50:15-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:15):**  some, some rye grasses too we'll put in, we'll put in a pretty diverse, uh, sword in there.  So we'll just run around with that no till, uh, and our management system really is, uh,  keep it sod.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:29):**  I mean, we, that's, that's what we do, you know, just try to do that whole balance of  livestock and foot action and sod and keep that ground covered.  I think that's so important just to keep everything growing in it.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:40):**  So we've got, you know, we've got sod that are 25 years old here that we've never touched  except for no tilling.  Uh, and it just never spun them over and they're incredibly productive.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:50):**  And if you manage them right, you give them enough rest.  You hit them hard and get off of them, get them that rest boy, you can just keep improving  them down the road.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:50:59):**  So that's, that's how we run it without having a plow through it.  I bet that's some pretty good soil.  I bet that have you done any carbon testing there?  
**[0:51:10-0:51:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:51:10):**  We did not, you know, and we are looking at doing some of that stuff here also, because,  um, this is just a whole other piece of what could be the catalyst that we talked about.  What could be the domino that could help flip, uh, you know, a scalable change or a systems  
**[0:51:30-0:51:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:51:30):**  change in agriculture and land management.  Uh, and it really comes down to, all right, who wants us right now?  And is it the consumer?  
**[0:51:41-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:51:41):**  Uh, is it the dairy industry itself?  Uh, you know, what is it?  And with the interest, which is good in climate, climate mitigation, uh, type of services.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:51:56):**  I do think that this could be that domino, uh, where you come in and you actually create  that true value of your practice based on what its climate mitigation potential could  be.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:52:11):**  And let's do an actual positives and negatives, uh, and do a complete assessment on it.  And I think that's where we're going to see regenerative permanent ground cover type of  management systems.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:52:25):**  Uh, if we can value and quantify it, I think that could clearly be that domino that could  validate these practices and take them to the financial markets and incentivize that.  And I think it takes consumer product markets, uh, and it's going to take skilled people  
**[0:52:43-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:52:43):**  in the middle of it to link the whole works.  So there's, I just pulled, this is the bigger, that's how we met.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:52:50):**  So that's how Joe and I met.  Cause we're trying to figure out how do we blow this thing up?  Well, and it really is.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:52:57):**  I mean, if you're gonna, you really need to look at this and I think, you know, not only  does it need to be done, uh, but I think there's a little bit of a, when you know, you know,  the solutions, the thing that can keep you up at night, when you know that there is a  
**[0:53:13-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:53:13):**  solution there, there's almost a sense of responsibility in a way that you need to make  this happen in a way.  Uh, and, and when you look at managed grazing, uh, livestock, dairy, whatever it may be,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:53:27):**  when you not only look at the economic, uh, implications of just playing, getting involved  into it and the profitability that that could be into it down the road.  But when you look at, uh, its environmental impacts, uh, when you look at the environmental  
**[0:53:43-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:53:43):**  impacts and how they could link into consumer product markets, into financial markets, uh,  to help drive this whole thing.  Uh, and when you look at its impacts into, uh, wildlife and even socioeconomic type of  
**[0:54:00-0:54:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:00):**  impacts and rural development, you can line that all up to a scorecard that would be second  to none.  And I think that's really what we need to look at to do one of these serious systematic  
**[0:54:11-0:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:11):**  changes out there.  Uh, so when we look at, and this has been some of the vision of DGA, uh, to begin with  realizing again, and I'll say it again and again, cause you can't, it's so important.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:24):**  It's people that are going to make this happen and are going to de-risk it.  It's going to be the people that know how to do this on the land and the connections.  So that's what you start with.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:33):**  You don't start with the investment fund or the consumer that wants a certain product.  You start with the people first and then you build these out.  So this is the level that we're at right now, trying to build these pieces out.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:46):**  And we're looking for the strategic partners that say, yeah, I'm looking for that dairy  disruptor.  You know, I can see how financial markets, skilled people and consumer markets can all  
**[0:54:57-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:54:57):**  line right up and do a reset and a systems level scalable change.  So this is really what we're trying to get set up and designed to do in the scalable  model that we're looking at based off of these types of managed grazing systems and the way  
**[0:55:17-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:55:17):**  to scale with integrity is to say, okay, can we flat out create the new 3000 cow dairy  and can that 3000 cow dairy basically be a combination of 15, 200 cow dairies, for example,  300 cow dairies, all in a 20 mile geographic area, all producing that same commodity scale  
**[0:55:44-0:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:55:44):**  and volume of milk that has got a consistent basic standards to it that you could take  to the market.  And that would reduce the procurement costs because these are the Achilles heels of the  
**[0:56:01-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:56:01):**  small dairy, of getting the managed grazing, the regenerative type of dairy farms.  So much just has to do with the logistics of transportation.  If you've got to have 40 spots to make a load of milk, that far, and this is the cost that's  
**[0:56:17-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:56:17):**  getting passed down to the farmers.  Also, you can't get a product to market when you got that much cost into it.  It'll all price the market and the farmer takes the beaten at the other end in many  
**[0:56:29-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:56:29):**  cases.  So this is just a way to say, okay, can we scale something with integrity by creating  regional clusters like this, where we've got individuals that are coming into it that are  
**[0:56:40-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:56:40):**  learning the trade and that have got every opportunity to work up to a management level  to equity earning and then ownership so that we could still have that 15 farms in a rural  area all under independent ownership in time too.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:56:56):**  And then you've got that scalable volume of product that you can take to the market based  on the true value, the true value based on its climate type of a profile, on its carbon  profile obviously, its wildlife, its soil, its social economic profile.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:57:15):**  Even its fair and equitable governance type of a profile because you've got the ability  of individuals to come up to a total workforce training program into ownership and entrepreneurship.  And then you are actually in a way decentralizing by scale in industry, which vertical integration  
**[0:57:37-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:57:37):**  is becoming its Achilles heel.  So let's take it a step farther and let's dump processing into these things then.  And then now let's ship a product, a condensed product instead of, you know, 80 pounds of  
**[0:57:53-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:57:53):**  water, let's ship the chunk of cheese or the pound of butter and let's service, they could  be regionally based types of markets that would come out of it.  I think we need to, if you're going to change something, change everything.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:58:07):**  And I think we need to think fearlessly and if we really want to create systems of change  and do a reset, we need to be looking at these things.  And I think it can be done, it's not just a policy thing, it's something we need to  
**[0:58:19-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:58:19):**  create.  I think this can be done through pure business principles.  And if you can align capital and innovative capital and you can align the skilled people  
**[0:58:30-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:58:30):**  and the people on the ground to do it.  And if you can align into consumer type of markets and distribution, there you got it.  I think we got that ability, especially with the scalable system.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:58:42):**  And I think that type of a model utilizing managed grazing dairy focused in these, I  call it decentralized scalable kind of production areas, utilizing farmers that have got 30  years of a career ahead of them.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:58:58):**  Hey, maybe we can do something.  We're talking about how to get new people involved.  I really love the idea of your dairy grazing apprenticeship.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:59:15):**  Maybe someday somebody will listen to this and like I said earlier, somebody listening  to this podcast needs to jump on a Regerative Grazing Guild and your idea of it being funded  by the beef checkoff, I think is just absolutely fantastic.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:59:29):**  The checkoff, I don't want to get down a rabbit trail yelling about the checkoff right now.  I was wondering if you're going to say anything about it.  We'll get Mike back for that or Mike von Massau or maybe have a checkoff round table where  
**[0:59:41-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:59:41):**  we can all yell about it.  But there's different, there's a dairy one and then there's beef, right?  So they all got a checkoff.  
**[0:59:50-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=0:59:50):**  So skimming some of those checkoff funds to help train the next generation, I think that'd  be a much better use of our checkoff dollars than where they're going now.  I'm there.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:00:03):**  I'd go for that.  The thing you have to be careful of is which training program does it go to?  And just the reality, the nature of the beast when you take a look at the large checkoff  
**[1:00:14-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:00:14):**  programs is they need to cater to their largest constituents.  And we hear this out of there.  So if 90% of the milk is coming from larger scale dairy, that checkoff money is going  
**[1:00:30-1:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:00:30):**  to go to an apprenticeship that's going to have a dairy manager or a calf manager.  There are 15 apprenticeships that you could almost do within a scaled 4,000 cow, 10,000  cow dairy.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:00:44):**  And that's most likely where I could see, but granted if there's on a level of playing  field that could come in, if a farmer could dictate where they want their checkoff to  go to, that'd be kind of cool too.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:00:55):**  Oh, that'd be lovely.  Well, that'd be something.  That's a whole different beast.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:00):**  And then I guess just to go there a little bit too, when you look at the dairy industry,  when you look at policy even, you've got to be careful.  You can spend a whole career trying to turn that ship and just get a little piece of it  
**[1:01:16-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:16):**  done.  Worthwhile it can be, but get a little piece.  So as we look at trying to create a systems change, really we are looking at that thing.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:24):**  If you can change something, let's change all of it and let's look outside of status  quo.  I almost think so.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:30):**  Getting this program going, this was not something that came out of dairy.  Dairy didn't want...  This came out of water people.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:40):**  This came out of...  Well, it was beginning farmers.  So obviously beginning farmer ranch development, BFRDP program.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:45):**  We have to plug into that.  That's what got this whole thing started.  There's a little bit of grazing land conservation initiative, just the initial seed money, then  
**[1:01:53-1:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:01:53):**  BFRDP money.  And then there's some NRCS conservation initiative money.  But then it's some private foundations that are looking at rural development and they're  
**[1:02:02-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:02:02):**  looking at water quality that's in behind it.  There's nothing from real conventional dairy that's really coming into this at all.  It's off the radar.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:02:16):**  It's hard to grasp what we're really talking about.  And so many of the constituents are not in this camp.  They're producing, they're very successful.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:02:30):**  They're producing the product in a different way.  So a lot of this, like I said, it is a bit off the radar.  You got to cater to that status quo.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:02:40):**  And that's the role of so many of these organizations.  So that is like, say, why we took a look at this and say, we just need to forge forward.  So when we look at these partners, so then we are looking for partners.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:02:53):**  We're looking for that scalable, innovative finance.  And then we're looking for that type of a team that can come in and help build this  whole dairy disruptor out and get behind it.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:03:11):**  Because that's what it takes.  It's just a pure businesses and investment and venture type of a thing with an incredible  potential.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:03:26):**  Something you mentioned earlier I want to circle back to, because I want to understand  it.  You said share milking systems.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:03:35):**  And I've been sitting here, I'm conjuring up several different ways how that works.  So explain it.  Explain what you meant by that.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:03:47):**  Yep.  And actually, this is another thing from New Zealand.  I mean, if you want to take a look at management systems and you want to be in the business  
**[1:03:56-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:03:56):**  for a long time, where's the lowest cost management system?  You take a look at managed grazing, you take a look in New Zealand, Ireland, some of these  other ones that are doing it that way.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:04:06):**  If you want to try to figure out how can I'm in a dairy when I've got an incredibly high  land price and supply services are really high, well, let's look at some of these developed  areas where it is that high, not necessarily developed areas, but areas where it is that  
**[1:04:20-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:04:20):**  high.  Well, there's New Zealand again too.  Share milking is a way for an individual to start investing into a dairy without, like  
**[1:04:30-1:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:04:30):**  I say, bringing that whole elephant onto their balance sheet.  So you may work into a dairy, prove yourself, work up to a manager.  You may start earning equity in cattle or you're able to come in and bring a portion  
**[1:04:44-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:04:44):**  of the cattle there where you're actually are able to invest in cattle, maybe some of  the basic equipment, but then you share a portion of the milk check now with the person  that owns the actual dairy.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:04:55):**  And this could happen with an individual, with an investment entity, whatever it may  be, but you come in and if you could bring all of the cattle, if you get to the point  where you've got all the cattle and you've got the equipment to run it, you may split  
**[1:05:08-1:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:05:08):**  that milk check.  And then there is a formula that comes with it where, okay, you got X amount of feed,  you supply X amount of the supplies, daily supplies to the farm, and then you just split  
**[1:05:23-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:05:23):**  that milk check, you know, 30, 37, whatever it may be, 50, 50, 40, 60, whatever it could  be.  And these are basically business arrangements.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:05:34):**  But that allows-  To incentivize them, right?  Yep.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:05:37):**  Yep.  And it allows, it obviously pays for good performance because you see it in the milk  check and then it also allows you to get that cash flow and that equity built up so you  
**[1:05:48-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:05:48):**  could start buying a chunk of that elephant in time.  And because you just flat need to be able to have that X percentage down and you need  to have enough cash flow to pay for principal.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:06:04):**  I was wondering what that concept was because another thing that was bouncing around in  my head is the milking parlor or whatever you guys use to milk, that's only used what,  20% of the day?  
**[1:06:18-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:06:18):**  Yeah.  So what if there is a guy next door that had some land and wanted to get into some dairy  cows, have you ever heard of anybody leasing out their milking facility to a neighbor for  
**[1:06:31-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:06:31):**  part of the day?  Milking facility is a little bit tough.  A couple of things is because you've got an actual milk license, you don't have to have  
**[1:06:40-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:06:40):**  a second milk tank there, you have to have a second operator there for just from the  state regulatory thing, it's difficult.  The other thing in most cases, if I've got a chunk of land that cows can reach and go  
**[1:06:53-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:06:53):**  to that land to come to the parlor, boy, just from a straight business standpoint, you're  better off investing in the cows and getting them to that land.  And do it yourself.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:07:02):**  Yeah, yeah, really.  Because you need to be looking at some of these things to get enough hundred weights  through and that is, so a parlor should be able to service, yeah, whatever land that  
**[1:07:15-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:07:15):**  a cow can walk to from that center, you want to be bringing her through there.  However, that doesn't, when you look at some of these business models on how to get in  and barriers of owning equipment, I mean, there's a lot of equipment that have wheels  
**[1:07:30-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:07:30):**  on it that costs a lot of money.  So there is the ability to, yeah, you could share equipment or you just flat, there's  more and more custom people out there.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:07:42):**  And actually even at the, with the cows that we have and the land base we run, I still  can't hardly justify having all of our own equipment.  I'll still hire in all the forage harvesters and the feed people and all the field work  
**[1:07:58-1:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:07:58):**  done.  So I even sold my round baler disc buying last year, which I feel bad because I was  cut hay for the neighbor here and I only have a disc buy now to go cut there.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:08):**  It's just a small field.  So I have to figure out plan B there.  But yeah, it's just, it's the nature of the business and the costs of what everything  
**[1:08:18-1:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:18):**  has done.  It's very difficult to be a hundred percent invested in each chunk of it.  Right.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:25):**  Yeah.  So, so anyway.  So yeah, that's, that is the nature.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:31):**  I think, you know, bottom line, you know, as we're visiting through a lot of this, you  know, I think we're in the same camp.  I mean, regenerative dairy and managed grazing, it has, it's got the tools.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:43):**  It's got the ability to address most, I bet every one of our issues and unintended consequences  with large status quo animal agriculture.  And it has got a lot of value to add to our industries in general too.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:08:59):**  And I think we need to realize that in our larger industries do need to realize that  also, that it can fill sectors that we always talk about.  I mean, there's, it can fill the milk sector that almonds are probably filling right now.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:09:14):**  So, and I think we really need to be looking at those types of things.  It's not a one way or the other, a competitive type.  Right.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:09:22):**  Right.  And I think this is all part of servicing that consumer and what they need out there.  Wonder how many times a day they have to milk the almonds.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:09:32):**  Where are the teats?  But I do think, so I've toured like the Blue Diamond Growers processing facility and like  they, their innovation is like, it's amazing because so, so what's come of it is, you know,  
**[1:09:50-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:09:50):**  they process the nuts, they dry them, and then they had all of these like leftover remnants  of nuts that weren't good because they weren't the right shape and whatever quality.  And then what did they decide to create?  
**[1:10:00-1:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:00):**  Almond flour.  And then almond, they juiced it and created almond milk and water.  And so I do think that, you know, we could take a node out of their, their, uh, process  
**[1:10:13-1:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:13):**  is like, they really are becoming an innovative and adding value to, to their product they're  already have.  And almond holes, like you guys, we feed that a lot to our, to our livestock is almond holes  
**[1:10:27-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:27):**  as a, as an alternative food feed stuff.  So yeah.  Yeah, I absolutely agree.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:34):**  I agree.  You've got to be, you got to be innovative.  You gotta be innovative in this, in this world and in all these markets, uh, not only state  
**[1:10:43-1:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:43):**  side, but it's, it's a global thing and you need to be looking for those types of things.  That's a, it can make it challenging.  That can make it fun.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:53):**  That can, uh, you know, create obstacles or it can create opportunities.  However you want to look at it.  Right.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:10:58):**  And I think there are, there's opportunity opportunities and fun in the whole thing,  uh, as you're trying to put these pieces together.  And I think that's what we need to be looking at it here too.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:11:07):**  Um, so, and I think, you know, it's, I, I am very positive about and optimistic about  livestock, about dairy, about agriculture.  You know, I think there's a ton of potential.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:11:20):**  I think that the consumer, uh, is becoming more and more aware all the time.  There's technology allowing them to be more engaged.  Uh, this climate thing also, and because it's a global problem and it's becoming more on  
**[1:11:39-1:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:11:39):**  the front stage, I think this does have the opportunity to come in and, and be that catalyst  for some of these other production systems and some of these real conversations about,  you know, what is happening on the land and how does land need to be run and how does  
**[1:11:54-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:11:54):**  the consumer express their buying power, uh, whether it is directly through consumable  products or maybe it is through climate type of markets and ESG type of markets, you know,  is, is the consumer someday going to be priding themselves and being net zero independently?  
**[1:12:11-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:11):**  Hmm.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm seeing it on my labels all the time now.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:18):**  Like my kombucha says carbon neutral kombucha and everything else that has a little ESG  label.  Um, yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:27):**  Absolutely.  I hate labels.  Brian.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:31):**  I, I think a lot of, a lot of labeling claims about carbon neutrality are very nebulous  because I think there's a, there's a lot of fraud, I think, and just outright bad science,  you know, going out, like in my background here, you can't go out to national forest  
**[1:12:51-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:51):**  and say, we're going to conserve 900 acres of trees and that's our carbon offset for  the year.  Well, bullshit.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:12:58):**  The trees aren't going to be cut anyway, so you're not changing anything.  You're not proactively managing to increase that carbon.  Right?  
**[1:13:06-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:13:06):**  So some of those claims I question and you know, thought I've been having for a little  while and I kind of made a note here is I am concerned that, you know, the, the climate  conversation and the coming carbon markets are going to lead to a corporate land grab  
**[1:13:24-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:13:24):**  where companies come out and they buy up these big farms, you know, and degraded land and  then hire minimum wage workers to implement their system and then all the carbon payments  flow back off shore.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:13:37):**  The profits flow back off shore and it ends up being another subsidy for, you know, private  parties and other companies in other countries like JBS and Marfrick and Smithfield.  You get what I'm saying though, right?  
**[1:13:51-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:13:51):**  Well, you know, a couple of things.  You know, Brian, you're right.  You know, welcome to capitalism and mad dog type of capitalism.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:13:58):**  That's just the way, you know, it goes.  I think we've got the opportunity here though to, to look for conscious capitalism with  integrity that does want to come in.  
**[1:14:10-1:14:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:14:10):**  I think there's a more of a dialogue on that.  So yes, when we look at a lot of the markets right now and the carbon markets and the environmental  and climate type of markets, it's a wild west.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:14:21):**  Nobody knows exactly what's out there.  There's a lot of them going off to the races right away with bad data, bad science.  You know, I look at what's happening underneath the industry groups within agriculture and  
**[1:14:35-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:14:35):**  they are doing a very good job of identifying status quo practices and putting the climate,  you know benefit onto it and attaching it to it.  You're going to see that.  
**[1:14:51-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:14:51):**  Now I think when we look at measurement, measuring change is not necessarily the solution.  We still need to be able to, it's good.  And that's what all the carbon markets are based on.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:15:08):**  There's one that probably isn't.  But the thing and the reality of this is you need to still be able to incentivize or you  need to be able to compensate for continued practices too.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:15:25):**  You know, right now the way I would capture the most money on a carbon market is to go  into one of the existing ones for example.  The best way I could do it is to take my thousand acres of permanent grass, fill the whole works  
**[1:15:38-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:15:38):**  up, run monoculture and corn and jazz, hammer that thing.  Don't do cover crops, don't do anything.  And then, hey, I'm going to convert to managed grazing dairy.  
**[1:15:49-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:15:49):**  Then there's your additionality.  There's my money.  So if I was a real business person, that's how I do it.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:15:56):**  You know, to really take advantage of climate carbon markets as they are right now, I think  there is a huge importance and a huge need to pay for or compensate or acknowledge continued  practice and not degradating a piece of land and a piece of acreage and keeping it where  
**[1:16:21-1:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:16:21):**  it is.  So keep a high producing one, high producing.  So I think there is a balance there with it.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:16:28):**  But I agree on a number of fronts.  I'm glad you said something about that.  You know, that if you really wanted to take advantage of the carbon market, you'd go till  
**[1:16:37-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:16:37):**  everything up right now and do corn, beans.  And just strip the carbon out of it for two years and then sign up.  And then it's like, oh yeah, look at what I did.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:16:47):**  And I think we can all agree that that might be a little dishonest.  And I don't think you would do that.  And I definitely wouldn't either.  
**[1:16:56-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:16:56):**  There's no way in hell I'm going to go plow up native range to destroy the carbon so I  could try to get more money for it.  That's just absurd.  
**[1:17:03-1:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:17:03):**  It's like we'll take four steps backwards to get one forward.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I agree.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:17:12):**  I think it's something I think we're so far in the front end of this.  But I do think, you know, and this is my a little bit of our fear too is as we're looking  at the whole regenerative world and the whole managed grazing permanent ground type of a  
**[1:17:26-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:17:26):**  world is, you know, we've got, I think, a relatively in the big picture of things, small  window to identify and quantify the true value of these types of management systems.  Because large ag is going full steam ahead, quantifying and validating, you know, the  
**[1:17:45-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:17:45):**  type of the current systems that are out there and the really scaled systems.  And we need to have a voice at that table that clearly black and white validates the  true value of what a permanent round cover and a regenerative system can do down the  
**[1:18:04-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:04):**  road.  And I think we owe it to it and we have to do that.  We have to get out there with that value because, you know, could there be a point and I think  
**[1:18:16-1:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:16):**  there maybe does need to be, should anybody have to be net zero before they can sell anything?  Right.  If that is the case, what agriculture system is net zero?  
**[1:18:30-1:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:30):**  It's managed grazing.  That's it when you take a look at it.  So if you really want to go to agriculture and say, okay, just like business, you can't  
**[1:18:40-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:40):**  sell a thing.  You are a buyer unless you're net zero.  That would be a tough conversation to have with agriculture right now.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:49):**  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's your next podcast.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:18:54):**  I mean, think about that.  I mean, if you absolutely feel, you know, the who's who are we selling credits to?  Well, they're the people that are net positive.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:19:05):**  They need to they need to get to net negative or net zero.  So when you really do the modeling.  So and we've the three farms that we've got set up here right now, and these are the farms  
**[1:19:17-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:19:17):**  I have, we're really setting those up to create a beta model.  So as we're looking for these innovators in the private world to come in and really create  a dis this disruptor and dairy, we need to obviously create some of these betas.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:19:35):**  So that's what we're looking at within these three farms.  We're demonstrating the scalability, the ability to create a semi load of milk and taking it  to the market.  
**[1:19:47-1:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:19:47):**  We're looking at some of these credits and some of these offsets that could come in to  help afford it and innovative finance and then obviously skill training on the whole  thing.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:19:57):**  But as we're doing just some basic modeling on the third farm that we just pulled onto  the platform, which was row crops for years.  It can actually have a net carbon or a net increase in carbon at its sequestering.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:20:16):**  If we put typical modeling against it and we would do even cover crops, it's still a  net emitter of carbon.  It is not net zero at that point.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:20:27):**  That's just through initial the models and the studies that are out there.  Look at it.  And I don't know.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:20:34):**  I think we need to be, you know, if you're going to play in these markets, just like  playing in in what dairy management system do you want to adopt to be in this for a long  term?

**[1:21:03-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:21:03):**  And I think that's something we need to be watching in this climate markets also.  Wow.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:21:12):**  Yeah, it is the Wild West.  And I think the rest of the, you know, as we move through the rest of 2021, a lot of  things are going to develop.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:21:25):**  I'm not going to say I'm frightened by the speed of change and the speed of information,  you know, these days, but the speed of change and the rate at which information gets disseminated,  you know, to all corners of an industry or to a sector is staggering.  
**[1:21:45-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:21:45):**  How fast things are moving now and how fast public opinion is changing too, like especially  about their food systems.  We've seen such a rapid shift in the last 18 months of people wanting to be interested  
**[1:21:59-1:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:21:59):**  in their food and taking part in their food production.  Yeah, I completely agree.  And we've seen demonstrations on, you know, yeah, whole different thing too is when you  
**[1:22:12-1:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:22:12):**  take a look at the food system, I mean, in all reality, this is a national security issue.  When you look at our current food system right now and the ability, it is so centralized  and so streamlined, the ability to shut down, you know, plants and processing and impact  
**[1:22:34-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:22:34):**  the whole supply chain with the flick of a switch, that's a big deal.  And when you, and you really need to look at that obviously as a security issue.  If you had, this is a whole other conversation, if you had an efficient regional type of a

You'd be so much more diversified and a lot less vulnerable to so many of these things.  I think just from that standpoint, in regards to, you know, a big systems manager, you would  
**[1:23:11-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:23:11):**  sure think that you'd want to have your foot in a number of these different buckets and  you'd want to diversify supply chains and production and management systems just to  give you more resilience for whatever is coming next.  
**[1:23:30-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:23:30):**  That's just me.  I live on a daily.  No, I agree.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:23:33):**  Something is coming next though.  So it's not for when whatever's coming next, something is coming next.  Like I truly believe something is coming next.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:23:39):**  And I think it's just a matter of, you know, what systems can give you the most diversification  and resilience to whatever curve ball is going to hit you next.  And I mean, there's curve balls out there that we have got no control over and you know,  
**[1:23:52-1:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:23:52):**  whether it is, you know, just something mechanical, technological or environmental.  Yeah.  $6 diesel fuel.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:24:03):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hacking the pipelines like that.  
**[1:24:06-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:24:06):**  That was, you know, someone was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for security and it  got hacked.  Yeah.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/21-Joe-Tomandl--Disrupting-the-Dairy-industry-e149i4g#t=1:24:14):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, nobody's, nobody's invincible.

Oh yeah.

**[0:00:35-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:00:35):**  Hey gang, welcome back to another week of Ranching Reboot.  This episode is sponsored by our generous patrons over on patreon.com forward slash  Red Hills Rancher.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:00:55):**  Today, we've got somebody that's been on quite a few podcasts and he's pretty famous for  some of the things that he talks about, which is remineralizing cattle with salt and a red  solo cup cow.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:01:08):**  So today from TaylorMade Cattle Company, we've got Steve Campbell going to join us.  But we're going to take a little bit different track to a lot of the podcasts you've probably  heard Steve on.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:01:19):**  We're probably going to talk about cows and remineralization, but that's going to be at  the end of the show.  Reason I wanted to hear today Steve is I have listened to, I'm not going to say every podcast  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:01:30):**  that you've done on every other platforms, but a lot of them, you know, red solo cup  cow.  I've heard that several times.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:01:37):**  The two great ones you've done on working cows, I've thought my head 161 and 196.  Those are both just chock full fantastic information.  But I don't really want to like rehash all that today because that's all out there.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:01:52):**  I want to know about Steve.  So Steve, why don't you start off by telling us a little bit about TaylorMade Cattle and  how you got your start?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:02:02):**  Well, I got the name when I was trying to put together enough information for the first  full day long school I was doing.  I had had a different name for my consulting before that, but it didn't really ring any  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:02:25):**  bells for me.  TaylorMade, what is your zip code?  What's your elevation?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:02:31):**  How much rain do you get?  What's the temperature, latitude, all of that takes a different kind of a cow for all of  these different environments and management styles.  
**[0:02:45-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:02:45):**  So that's how I come up with the Taylor spelled with an I, T-A-I-L-O-R.  But I was born back in the 50s and always around cattle.  We got in the trucking business when I was six or so because the ranch wasn't big enough  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:03:04):**  to support two families, dad and uncle Daryl.  So I can't agree.  Common story out of the late 50s I'm told.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:03:12):**  Pardon me?  Common story from the late 50s I'm told.  Well anyway, so I grew up around cows, but it was the smelly end, washing out, scooping  
**[0:03:22-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:03:22):**  out, driving cattle trucks, working on cattle trucks.  And I guess my experiences from that, one learning something about a cow and stockmanship  and whatnot, how to be a helper other than slow things down around the corral or the  
**[0:03:44-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:03:44):**  load and shoot was a preventive maintenance on trucks.  I didn't want the trucks to break down.  So I wasted a little money, according to a lot of people on the amount of service and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:04:01):**  preventing maintenance I did.  Dad died and I moved back up to a ranch that he had bought in the mid 70s.  I moved it back up to it in 88 there in the mountains where I was born.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:04:13):**  And I took that preventive maintenance, well preventive health back to raising stalkers  on grass and how do you get them to not get pneumonia when they first get there or pink  eye and foot rot.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:04:31):**  And if that happened, one how to get over, but how to not have that happen next year.  Same sort of thing with weeds and then promoting the growth of dung beetles and spiders and  worms and birds.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:04:46):**  Maybe I maybe I beat that up enough.  Oh, keep going.  I like it.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:04:52):**  Okay.  I got a degree in economics and I had a final from an older German professor and it was  really hard to get an A, but it was extremely hard to get 100.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:05:06):**  And a friend of mine after the first final I took says, Dr. Grau wants to see you.  You've got 100 he thinks you cheated.  And I actually answered something a little better than average and he gave me extra points.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:05:18):**  I have no clue what I got right.  But I certainly learned what I got wrong.  Kind of back to why did that cow get sick?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:05:27):**  The marginal efficiency of capital.  So if I spend $1, do I get $10 back 375 a buck and a quarter or 95 cents?  Well I took that to heart for the truck and for the cows.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:05:42):**  Maybe I'm spending $10 more on something.  Well, let's just say on the mineral side, but the actually on the the mineral deal that  I like is, you know, these are all natural products that God gave us.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:05:59):**  And just if you can entice the right amount, it actually is less money than virtually every  mixed mineral out there.  Anyway, how do I get the cattle to consume a few more minerals so I don't have to talk  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:06:16):**  to pink eye or foot rot or scours?  Or what do you do to not have to pull calves?  Glenn?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:06:22):**  Can we pause there for a second?  Okay, so you're saying that by feeding minerals, we can clean up pink eye foot rot?  I'm saying my feeding clean minerals was about 15 years ago, I found a little book in a second  
**[0:06:43-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:06:43):**  hand store called the Fateful Harvest by Duff Wilson.  And as it turned out, the mayor of Quincy, Washington also went to the same college I  did.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:06:55):**  And long story short, well, now I know this person, I need to read this book, but the  co-op in Quincy, Washington, hey, that's pointing a big finger at somebody, they were putting  toxic chemicals, not chemical minerals into the minerals mix for the fertilizer, and crops  
**[0:07:16-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:07:16):**  died or wouldn't grow, cattle, horses died or got sick.  And this Duff Wilson kind of an investigative journalist, he wrote that book.  And from that point on, on the mineral side of things, I bought nothing from China.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:07:31):**  And I've been when I did that, and I went away from any mixed mineral and just was using  Redmond salt and a little later the Redmond conditioner, my health problems just kind  of melted away by using these God given underground clean sources.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:07:53):**  So was that an overnight change?  Or did that kind of take a couple of years?  Well, it wasn't just overnight, it takes 120 days to change out all the red blood cells  
**[0:08:06-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:08:06):**  in the cow or you, Brian.  So the minimum amount of time to reach the first or the next rung on the ladder of health  would be that 120 days.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:08:19):**  But from one year to the next, the number of copper bumps, which is the cow over your  left shoulder if she doesn't have it, but right, right behind the hook bones in front  of the tail, if the cows have a little bump there, that was either a lack of copper in  
**[0:08:36-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:08:36):**  the diet, or something in the environment, tying up that copper, and so they they got  this pronounced bump there.  Within one year, those virtually went away.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:08:51):**  So it wasn't overnight, but it did not take years to happen with by the next year, the  quality of the calves was better, these indicators of mineral deficiencies.  The phenotype of the animals was better coming out of a cow.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:09:10):**  Did you hear what I just said the phenotype of the animal was better coming out of the  cow, I was finally expressing the genetics that I owned.  As I got the epa, the air, the water, the grass, the mineral stockmanship, the epigenetics  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:09:27):**  were a whole lot closer to what that cow needed.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:09:35):**  So observations with Redmond and salt and Redmond conditioner, you said, clean up your  cow herd, what what timeframe was this?  You gave me another thought there, but that was about 20 years ago.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:09:52):**  Okay, 20 years ago.  Yeah, give or take a year.  That's when I started down that path, I had broken my right ankle, really bad and a horse  
**[0:10:02-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:10:02):**  deal and this chiropractor certified applied kinesiologist, he really was an expert in  nutrition and he said, quit eating that inflammatory food, sugar, flour, well, rice, potatoes,  you know, concentrated carbohydrates, eat these omega threes and high water content  
**[0:10:25-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:10:25):**  vegetables and, and my pain went away.  Well, the looking at what was going on with the hooves on my horses and winter feed versus  summer feed and smooth and rough and you know, things were starting to click there, West  
**[0:10:43-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:10:43):**  in a price Maynard Murray, reading all of those books about that same time.  Maynard Murray had used a sea deposit sea salt deposit out of the Gulf of Mexico Sea  90.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:10:59):**  Yep.  And, and that is still available today.  I think their fourth person it was Maynard Murray, Don Jansen.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:07):**  Oh, man, I'm gonna do somebody injustice here.  It's okay, I get all the hate mail anyway.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:16):**  Yeah.  I get all the hate mail for when something gets wrong.  But yeah, but anyway, that was the one that the idea got me started, but I live so much  
**[0:11:25-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:25):**  closer to Redmond, and that it was it was readily available about 100 miles from where  I live.  Okay.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:35):**  And where do you live?  I don't think I know.  Well, I was born in the mountains of Idaho.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:39):**  So 40% up the left side, the west side of Idaho.  And then we moved down into the Boise Valley, the Treasure Valley and kind of grew up down  there and in early 30s, I moved back to the mountains and I lived up there for 24 and  
**[0:11:58-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:11:58):**  a half years and now I live on the very western edge of the the Treasure Valley, if you will,  I'm I'm all about four miles from the Snake River about where the squiggly line starts  on the western, the southern end of that squiggly line, I'm over by there.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:12:16):**  I like to check the map and see what that part of the world looks like.  I'll have to admit, I've never been to Idaho, I think I've only flown over it like maybe  once or twice looked at on a map a couple times.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:12:27):**  There is a there's a kind of a banana across the bottom of a little ways up from the bottom  of the state of Idaho.  And that's the Snake River plain.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:12:38):**  And it starts out about 5000 feet elevation over on the west side, and it gets down to  2000, maybe a little bit lower.  Well, by the time it gets to Lewiston quite a bit lower on the on the west side, but there's  
**[0:12:54-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:12:54):**  mountains south of that in Idaho and mountains north where we're blessed with water.  But if you didn't irrigate in the Snake River plain, it would be sagebrush.  So someone said if you could take a steamroller and flatten out all the mountains in Idaho,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:13:12):**  it would be as big as Texas.  I could believe that.  And that that kind of leads me to start wanting to chase a rabbit about water in the west.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:13:22):**  But maybe that maybe that's for another entire podcast.  But so you're you're reliant on irrigation to grow your forage.  Where I live now, it's all sprinklers.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:13:34):**  And if I did not have irrigation water, it's about 11 inches.  So I would need, oh, golly, 15, 20 times the number of acres that I have to do what I do.  Up in the mountains, it was all in our irrigation season, something like 170 days up in the  
**[0:13:55-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:13:55):**  mountains.  It was all wild flooding, as someone called it.  But you know, you're out there with a shovel and keeping it spread out.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:14:07):**  And that irrigation season was about 110 days.  But there were years where it frosted every year up there in the mountains too.  So it was interesting.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:14:18):**  Okay.  I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about how water is used in the mountains and in  the west, you know, for how so much of it is diverted for irrigation.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:14:33):**  And then, you know, we stop it downriver, like on the Colorado River, Lake Powell, Lake  Mead for because people have to have drinking water.  And I wonder how sustainable of a practice that is going forward.  
**[0:14:46-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:14:46):**  We're experiencing record drought in lots of the country.  You know, I didn't look for Idaho, but I know I saw it yesterday that there's Colorado and  New Mexico snowpack is in a lot of places 20, 30, 40% of what it should be.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:15:03):**  And there was only one region where it was actually above normal.  Are you guys looking at maybe some short irrigation this year?  Shorter irrigation, but we're nowhere near that short.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:15:14):**  But one of the things you've mentioned there, I'd like to address and that was my uncle  had lived there in New Meadows his whole life.  And his comment was you need to control your irrigation.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:15:27):**  And when I first moved up there, I was having a heck of a time trying to get the water spread  out and I was looking for extra ditch right to get water down there.  And it was taking me 15 or 16 days to make a go round and come back.  
**[0:15:44-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:15:44):**  And within about five years, once you understand the water, and I pick it up and use it three  different times before it ever I ever got through with it.  Well now I'm getting through in about 12 days time and shutting the water off every once  
**[0:16:00-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:16:00):**  in a while.  So someone who doesn't know anything about water will waste a lot of water.  And to someone that water is dear to will use it wisely.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:16:14):**  Yes, and my uncle I remember one time in August, I had him come by I was trying to figure out  what I what I had left in front of me and we kind of looked at everything and he said,  Well, I think you're right.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:16:27):**  I don't think you've got enough water, or excuse me enough grass to make it to the end  of the grazing season.  I just had too many cattle that year.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:16:35):**  But he said, I have never seen grass of this quality this time of year in my life in New  Meadows, and he was 60 something at that point.  So yeah, people that have a vested interest in using the water to the best of their ability  
**[0:16:55-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:16:55):**  will not waste water.  I would agree with that.  But in the back of my head, there's also the California almond farmer that's farming in  
**[0:17:06-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:17:06):**  the desert Central Valley that's trying to irrigate walnut and almond trees in the middle  of the valley saying that it's a responsible use of water.  That's probably a whole different conversation.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:17:21):**  Yeah, you know, what I would I best.  Oh, golly.  Now I'm lacking for names here.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:17:34):**  Don Huber from Purdue has been poking a big finger at Roundup for a long time.  And he was in a chat group on an email deal.  And another fellow on the group said, is there something missing in the soil that's keeping  
**[0:17:54-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:17:54):**  us from getting these more uniform rains like we used to get, you know, now we just as dry,  dry, dry, and then we get this big deluge and a lot of it runs off.  And Dr. Huber just immediately said, yeah, there were these four organisms and he listed  
**[0:18:08-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:18:08):**  them all out and said, the wind would pick those up, take them up into the atmosphere,  coal as clouds, and you would get a rain.  We have killed those off with chemicals.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:18:19):**  And so we don't get that more uniform rain throughout the year like we used to.  But there are just more people now than there used to be.  So the need for water for human beings has gone up.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:18:33):**  And I guess thinking about maybe where your mind is going, the book Collapse by Jared  Diamond.  It's a big, a big thick book.  
**[0:18:43-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:18:43):**  He wrote a number of big books, but we tend to put people in cities and we have to go  farther and farther and farther away to produce the food to feed them.  And then we get a bad year where there's no moisture and half the people die and Machu  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:19:01):**  Picchu, they never went back.  You know, it's like, well, that's, we'll just leave that as a monument to our stupidity  for what we did.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:19:10):**  I think that scenario got repeated several times in ancient history, not just Machu Picchu,  the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Romans, all their civilizations had major,  major problems when their quote advanced farming techniques failed.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:19:30):**  A very good book with a third as many words that gets the point across at least as well  is Dirt, The Erosion of Civilization by David Montgomery.  And that was his first of a trilogy of books about the subject.  
**[0:19:47-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:19:47):**  The second one was The Hidden Half of Nature talking about the biology and the soil.  And then the third was Growing a Revolution where he talked to people like Gabe Brown  and Ray Archuleta and Christine Jones and others.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:03):**  I got those titles.  I need that name again because I missed it.  David Montgomery.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:12):**  That's a pretty good list of books to read.  I'm going to have like two full pages of show notes for all these books you're giving me.  It's fine.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:22):**  Well, I was motivated to learn some stuff because when I changed my diet, the pain in  my ankle went away.  And it's like, well, how does this work?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:32):**  Well, how does this work in the soil?  How does this work in our cows?  Kind of an inquiring mind all through the years.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:40):**  Because it's all connected.  Absolutely.  Like, we are the soil, we're made from the soil.  
**[0:20:45-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:20:45):**  And that is our ultimate destination when the soul, the spark of life and consciousness  leaves our body, we will become soil again to feed another generation of living creatures.  I agree.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:21:01):**  And I think like the extension from that, that I've really kind of gotten into in the  last couple of weeks, you know, just the other day, there was a paper that came out saying  that the USDA tested, I think it was like 600 or 700 animals, beef animals.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:21:19):**  And they found antibiotic residue in quite a few of them that were specifically marketed  as antibiotic free through a plant that said we only kill animals that don't have antibiotics.  And I even remember going on to read that about 25% of those animals that they popped  
**[0:21:37-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:21:37):**  for antibiotics were part of the GAP program.  Which that's the program that Whole Foods uses to certify their beef has been, you know,  all naturally treated and, you know, hasn't had GMOs or antibiotics or growth hormones.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:21:53):**  They're finding growth hormones in those animals that are labeled for that with the producer  affidavit saying we never gave this animal antibiotics.  I wonder how that's going to reflect on the rest of the beef industry at large.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:22:09):**  And I don't know how you feel about it.  But it's my understanding that there's a very large percentage of animals that when they  hit the feedlot are classified as high risk and get antibiotics right off the truck.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:22:26):**  Like specific percentages, I'm sure that nobody really wants to let that be known.  But I know what happens, right.  And I think any feedlot manager will admit that it happens but doesn't want to talk about  
**[0:22:37-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:22:37):**  the difference between high risk, low risk and no risk.  And he doesn't want to talk about how many of those high risk cattle there really are.  Those are a couple conversations I'd like to have maybe on down the line.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:22:49):**  If you want to have that conversation with me, go ahead and write in.  We'll try to set that up.  So back to the point.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:22:58):**  We are soil, our cows are soil.  And it's a closed loop.  It's basically a closed loop that we need to start thinking about production in.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:23:08):**  And what can the soil provide for my animals?  If my soil and my land can't provide everything I need for my animals, do I have the right  animals for my land?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:23:20):**  That's another good question.  Wow, I wish I had a piece of paper so I could write down my little high point here.  But Weston A. Price, a dentist back in the early 1900s in Cincinnati, he was seeing so  
**[0:23:34-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:23:34):**  much facial deformity in cavities.  He thought it must be something in the environment or in our food and went around the world,  found these 15 groups of people eating in the old way, nothing modern, western process.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:23:47):**  It was how they grew and prepared their food.  A lot of the preparation was fermentation, heat, moisture, slight acidity, a little bacteria  and time.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:23:57):**  Virtually anything fermented is better for you.  One of the reasons for that is it's got probiotics in it.  So, these groups, there was no rhyme or reason about a fat protein carbohydrate, minimum  
**[0:24:11-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:24:11):**  fat 30, Eskimos 80% fat.  The common denominator in 1930s, hang on one second.  Was that the average American was getting five to 10 times the vitamins and minerals.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:24:32):**  I'm holding up sea salt, but you could have Himalayan salt, you could have the red, that  was the red man real salt.  Anyway, there are a number of those sea salt.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:24:42):**  You remember earlier I said, look when those calves were born the year after I switched  and nothing from China.  Why nothing from China?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:24:55):**  Virtually every mineral coming out of China has cadmium in it.  The first thing cadmium does is screws up a cow's ability to regulate internal body  temperature.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:25:07):**  The way you would know that you had cadmium in your herd, if they have a slow hump in  their back from the hook bones up to the shoulder blades.  Right, that's where the back looks like it's ridged up a little bit above where it carries  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:25:27):**  the ribs.  Yeah, so some people call it a ridge back.  You know, and you could have a cow with hardware that could look that way as well.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:25:35):**  But if you've got three out of 100 that are showing this all the time, they're your miner's  canary saying, hey, I've got a dirty mineral.  And it was well pointed out in that book, what was going on there by Duff Wilson, the  
**[0:25:52-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:25:52):**  fateful harvest.  Anyway, wow, this is a rabbit hole.  Pottinger's cats, he back in the 40s and 50s there, I can't remember whether it was LA  
**[0:26:06-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:26:06):**  or San Fran, he had the cats in two locations, and he was doing adrenal ectomies.  And then they were trying to get the adrenal tablets for human beings, just all of them  to be the same.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:26:17):**  Well, he found that the cats that were in the facility where it was cooked meat and  cooked milk within four generations, they couldn't reproduce some of those cats didn't  even make it through the surgery.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:26:27):**  The ones that were on raw meat and milk, they stayed perfectly healthy for each generation  of that cooked diet, which think about how much more processed our food is today.  It took three generations of the raw diet for those cats to get their health back.  
**[0:26:45-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:26:45):**  Well, now I have, oh, three or four of my clients that are there, they've got third  generation calves on the ground now from cows that have a clean, mineral rich interuterine  environment.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:27:03):**  And one particular gentleman in Northwest South Dakota, he had 42 of those second, you  know, the cow got cleaned up and she had a heifers and steers and well bulls, but they  steered him anyway, 42 of those heifers he kept for replacements.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:27:24):**  And then they're clean and mineral rich and they get pregnant and they have a calf.  So he said, if you took all my 270 cows, and you picked out the 50 best cows out of everybody,  breeding those first calf heifers, 35 of that 50 would be out of my first calf heifers,  
**[0:27:47-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:27:47):**  because he was finally expressing the genes that he already owned.  So it's, I don't know how I even got there, rabbit hole.  Looking for those party girls that can conceive at 14 months.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:28:01):**  Well he was, yeah, party girls, I guess I think about earlier, but I mean, you know,  he was breeding at 15 months to have a calf at two, so he's every 365.  And glandularly, hair coats, butter fat, the phenotype, everything coming out of those  
**[0:28:22-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:28:22):**  cows, they were just better animals.  He at the point of conception, you know, he's feeding his bulls the same way as the cows  at the point of conception, he put together as close as he could the best genetics that  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:28:36):**  he could.  If the bull was only fed to here, that's as good as it's gonna be.  You know, and you can't go beyond that.  
**[0:28:43-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:28:43):**  Well, by getting that clean mineral rich 120 days before the bull and cow get together,  everybody listening, if you've got cows, you have better genetics than you're seeing because  unless you're Gabe Brown or someone like him, you do not have good enough epigenetics, soil,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:29:07):**  bricks in the grass, 12, 14, 18 bricks grass, B-R-I-X, the level of minerals in the grass  or in a tomato or in a carrot.  Right.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:29:24):**  Bricks of sugar, that's what I've always understood as sugar.  It's a measure of how much sugar and carbon that that plant is storing up in the leaves  or in different parts.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:29:36):**  I have trouble finding grasses over about six, no matter how I graze or what I do, but  I haven't tried foliar C90 yet, which is probably what you're gonna tell me I ought to try.  No, you finally got me out of my rabbit hole here.  
**[0:29:50-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:29:50):**  So what I was about to say is Weston A. Price in World War One in the draft, the people,  the man out of the Southeast, white men have been there the longest and had farmed that  land the longest.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:30:04):**  Seven out of 10 were not good enough physical specimens to go into the army.  Upper Midwest, we hadn't been there near as long.  We settled the coast first.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:30:16):**  Seven out of 10 of those men were good enough physical specimens.  Well, 100 years ago, we were eating real close to home, not like we are today.  So there was a big difference.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:30:26):**  And then the number of scientists per 100,000 of population less than 300 in the South and  Southeast per 100,000, over 600 in the upper Midwest.  So having the minerals in the food turns us into Arnold Schwarzenegger and Albert Einstein.  
**[0:30:48-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:30:48):**  And then there's another book called, sorry, I'm getting off on a different deal here,  but Food and Behavior by Barbara Reed Stitt, and she was a parole officer.  And normally in the early 90s, four out of five parolees were back in prison within five  
**[0:31:07-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:07):**  years of her parolees, she could get to change what they ate.  Four out of five were still productive members of society.  When I was a kid, people would say about Jim, well, I wonder what side of Betty got out  
**[0:31:20-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:20):**  of this morning.  But the better question might've been, I wonder what he ate for breakfast.  Did he eat sugar or did he eat protein or fat?  
**[0:31:29-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:29):**  Yeah.  Big old one bowl of Captain Crunch.  Well, and the other thing is we've introduced 50 million unique substances in the last 75  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:40):**  years, and not all of them are good for us.  So we've been on the land.  We have the Dust Bowl.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:44):**  We tried to put it back to grass after we mined a bunch of minerals out of it.  The more you mob your cattle up, the more often you move them, the quicker we'll get  the minerals back in the soil.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:31:54):**  And you can talk Elaine Ingum or the Johnson Sioux bioreactor, all that sort of thing.  But the other challenge we have now that they didn't have 75 years ago is all of these toxins  that man has put in the environment.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:32:08):**  So our cows actually need more minerals now to function than they had available back then  because we've put a whole bunch of straws on the camel's back, a whole bunch of toxic  straws.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:32:21):**  Yep.  Yep.  So you're talking about toxicity and cadmium, and you said minerals from China are contaminated  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:32:31):**  with cadmium.  Now, I know you're not saying that because you're racist and you hate China.  I know that.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:32:38):**  I know you're saying that because you're warning people that these products from China are  not good for your cows.  So I don't think anybody probably would know.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:32:52):**  So when you buy a mineral block from the co-op, not that you do that, and I quit doing that  last year after listening to a couple of your podcasts.  So you buy that co-op mineral block or that bag from your local feed supplier and it lists  
**[0:33:07-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:33:07):**  off everything it's got in it, copper, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, all this  other crap.  Okay, where do those vitamins come from?  
**[0:33:16-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:33:16):**  Where do those minerals come from?  Well, to compete on price, typically cadmium.  I guess when you were going through all that, what came to me was caveat impetur.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:33:28):**  Let the buyer beware.  And you asked me how far I wanted to go.  Let the buyer beware on everything, including whether or not you want your needle in your  
**[0:33:42-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:33:42):**  arm over the course of the last year.  But to get that, that requires a level of transparency that's difficult to achieve.  And I'm talking about transparency in the supply chain.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:33:58):**  So back to what you were saying, here's this GAP certified and they tested them and here  is all of this.  There is a lot of cheating.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:34:09):**  They're willing to sign their name to get a dollar.  We do that way too much these days.  People don't stand up to their principles.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:34:17):**  Know your farmer, know your rancher.  If I come to you, Brian, and I look you in the eye and you're telling me unwaveringly  with your eyes that no, I did not use any antibiotics, I'm more likely to believe you  
**[0:34:31-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:34:31):**  than the slick trade magazine that they get paid big dollars to spin whatever it is they're  trying to sell.  When was the last time you watched the movie Wag the Dog?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:34:46):**  I haven't, but I just listened to an episode of Joe Rogan that had the guy on it that wrote  and directed that movie.  It was really interesting.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:34:57):**  I'm 100% familiar with the concept of the tail wagging the dog.  Is that what's happening right now with our cattle mineral?  The tail is telling us this is safe, this is safe, this is what you need to feed.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:35:15):**  What they're telling us is look at the label on this package and look at the label on our  package.  It's the exact same minerals.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:35:23):**  Ours is $10 a bag cheaper.  Well you get what you pay for in a lot of cases.  I can't say every case.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:35:35):**  You used to be able to say that, but maybe you can't anymore.  Anyway, there are places where you can get clean minerals mixed, but not very many.  That's why the sea salt here, there's Redmond, Kansas, the C90.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:35:58):**  I'm going to go a different place on the C90.  The Himalayan, these are the underground sources of sea salt.  The ancient sequestered sources that you like to talk about.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:36:11):**  Anything that's been blowing in the air, there was air pollution.  We get enough air pollution and it inhibits our ability to control our behaviors.  We get the guy going up on the 23rd floor of the motel there in Las Vegas with the machine  
**[0:36:38-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:36:38):**  gun.  Kind of funny how we never heard anything else in the news about that, but go on.  Well, I mean, it's like, sorry, Lee Harvey Oswald.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:36:49):**  I'm just a patsy.  What was going on that they didn't want us to know about?  They hired this guy to go do this thing and said, yeah, well, I don't know.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:36:59):**  I'm getting off track here.  You can get on whatever track you want to get on, Steve.  It's just really hard to find good, honest people.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:37:10):**  I am absolutely blessed.  I am absolutely blessed.  95% of my clients around the country are good Christian cattle people.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:37:24):**  And I say it in that order.  I don't get around very many that aren't good ones.  For whatever reason, maybe there's the law of attraction or whatever.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:37:36):**  And I know who made me and I thank him every day.  And yeah, like, interestingly enough, that podcast 196 with Clay, I went to bed one night  and, you know, say my prayers always out loud.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:37:52):**  And then I said, God, what do you want me to do?  How do I help?  And you can edit this out if you want.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:37:59):**  And I'm thinking Fauci and Pfizer.  And I woke up the next morning and it's like, you got to call Clay Connery.  We haven't had a spring and it's already summer.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:38:07):**  Cows couldn't recover from last winter's feed.  We're going to have way more pink eye, foot rot, scours, that sort of thing, because there's  very little nutrition.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:38:17):**  And that was literally God was like, Steve, you need to do this.  That's your job today.  So that's how 196 became a reality.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:38:28):**  Well, it was one of those that I think I listened to it probably three, four, maybe even five  times because just to make sure that I under that I was understanding what you're saying.  Hey, Brian, right, right here, because I didn't say it well enough.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:38:47):**  In the talk.  We've got our we've got our tea bag.  Okay, we're making the mineral water in any more.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:38:59):**  I was telling everybody every different way to make it any more.  If you have a stock tank, some people don't, we got to do something else.  It's not metal.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:39:10):**  Well if you've got a metal and we're not doing this, it's on a float.  You know, every other day Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we're putting this tea bag in but  when you go to take that tea bag out, you kind of get the weight of it.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:39:24):**  And when you feel like you've got the weight, you just jerk it up out of there and throw  it out because you don't want to leave a cloud in that water up for the fresh day because  that's an imbalance of minerals.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:39:39):**  I had people telling me well I would swirl the bag around in there before I take it out  or I'd run the water right on top of it.  No, you want it as far away from the water coming in and solids, the solids that are  
**[0:39:53-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:39:53):**  still in the bottom of your tea bag that didn't dissolve just by water kind of circulating  by.  That's the ugly stuff.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:40:02):**  That's the stuff you want to go put on your ranch roads or around something you never  want to grow.  The extra sodium chloride and any imbalance.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:40:11):**  But I just wanted to show that deal which you can't see, it's only my face, but you  boy, when you get ready to take it out of there, get it out of there in a hurry and  you're trying to leave the smallest cloud behind in that water because that means you  
**[0:40:27-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:40:27):**  left the least amount of imbalance in that water.  Okay, do you have a specific kind of bag that you like?  I mean, I think I heard you say burlap sack.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:40:39):**  Last year.  Two course.  A burlap bag is two course.  
**[0:40:48-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:40:48):**  I don't know if you can see it, I'll try to hold it up here.  But it's that woven nylon, feed sack stuff.  I don't have anything else right here.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:41:03):**  There are some dog food bags that look kind of like that, but they're really shiny.  You grab one of those and you stick a water hose in it.  If the water doesn't just start running out, it's the wrong kind of woven bag.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:41:19):**  You need kind of that nylon, plastic, whatever it is, woven bag.  Bear on it to hold a little bit, but also to have a good leak rate, but not just to  run out.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:41:38):**  Let me put it this way.  A burlap sack is two course and a 600 count pillowcase is two fine.  A pant leg would work.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:41:48):**  Okay, pant legs or mineral water.  Got it.  It's getting to be summer.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:41:54):**  You want shorts.  Now we've got two tee bags for minerals.  You might want to wear a short, sir, but I do not.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:04):**  My legs get to see the sun for about 30 seconds and they are toast.  I'm the same way.  I do not.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:11):**  Typical rancher, tanned everywhere.  Tanned in the face, tanned arms.  Lily white legs.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:18):**  Well, I don't even remember how we got to where we are, but maybe you've got some  other thing in mind.  We were talking about fermentation and that some of the best things to eat for people  
**[0:42:30-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:30):**  are fermentation.  Humans are hindgut fermenters.  That all takes place in our small lower intestine.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:39):**  It stands to reason if we're eating foods like sauerkraut that have been pre-fermented,  that's going to be easier for our system to digest.  But cattle are different because they're foregut fermenters.  
**[0:42:51-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:42:51):**  All that fermentation takes place in the room and with all the microbes.  So does fermentation of feedstocks, for lack of a better term, that should have a different  effect on the cow than it has on us, shouldn't it?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:43:12):**  Brian are you asking me about us eating, what would you want to call it?  I mean, I'm thinking cellulosic fiber, but fiber.  I'm just thinking sauerkraut because that's what comes to mind when I think of fermented.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:43:28):**  Well, you know, you think about a gorilla or a chimpanzee.  They have a bigger gut than we do because they eat more cellulosic fiber than we do.  There is a book called, it might be Carnivore Diet.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:43:49):**  It's Paul Saladino.  I mean, he's like, the only thing you want to eat is meat.  And his last name is Saladino.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:43:57):**  Paul Saladino.  Yeah, anyway, it is crazy in there where he goes back and shows where once we got into  more animal protein, how quickly our brains grew in size.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:44:17):**  And it's a pretty good book, but he's maybe a little bit too adamant about what he knows.  I guess if I was going to, you know, hey, he would win every argument that he and I  or discussion that he and I ever had.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:44:35):**  Absolutely.  I do not know a tenth of what that man knows.  But it almost sounds a little, it's like, well, I don't know.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:44:46):**  I think I'll just leave it right there.  I think that the Carnivore Diet can work for a lot of people.  I think that there's a lot of benefits.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:44:57):**  I can see some benefits to it.  And I can also see some places where that might be a train wreck.  I haven't gone completely over to the carnivore side.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:45:05):**  I'm not completely on the keto side.  But just like with your experience, I cut out the refined grains, the white bread, the  sugar.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:45:15):**  My joints don't hurt anymore.  It's kind of amazing how that happens.  And it just took getting that crap out of my life for four or five days.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:45:25):**  And it makes a big change.  This kind of relates but it doesn't.  There was a study Joe Robinson found eatwild.com.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:45:39):**  He's got a website, but this was 20 years ago, 18, 19, 20 years ago.  And they had 610 people who had had a heart attack.  So we put half the men in each group, half the women, half the tall, half the short,  
**[0:45:55-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:45:55):**  half the heavy, half the skinny.  They tried to make the groups as even as they could.  And they put one group on the American Heart Association diet.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:46:05):**  And then they put the other group on mostly that diet, but they took away some omega-6s  and added omega-3s and then more high water content vegetables.  And it was supposed to last for five years, 60 months, but they had to quit at 37 months  
**[0:46:24-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:46:24):**  because it was unethical to continue.  Too many people on the American Heart Association diet were dying and they couldn't force them  to eat the diet that the American Heart Association says you should eat after a heart attack or  
**[0:46:40-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:46:40):**  if you want to prevent one, it didn't work.  I wonder why.  So Dr. Robert Lustig, the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center did a talk, Sugar,  
**[0:47:00-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:00):**  The Bitter Truth.  This was seven, eight years ago.  The first one was, there's a lot of biology kind of going over your head, but it was super  
**[0:47:08-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:08):**  interesting and I was telling everybody about it.  And about three weeks in, I went back to watch it again for the fourth time.  I mean, you know, whatever.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:18):**  And here's this placard and it says, the Board of Regents of the University of California,  San Francisco Medical Center has determined that it is no longer in our best interest  to have this video on our website.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:31):**  Well, whoever was giving them 10 or 20 million bucks said, you get that guy off of there  where your money is going away.  But I mean, he called a spade a spade.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:42):**  Sugar, sugar is what gives us heart disease, not the fat.  So you've got HDL, the good stuff, LDL, the bad stuff.  Well, there's two types, large buoyant from fat.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:47:56):**  I had to listen to that talk three times to learn this word.  It can't, the fat can't get in behind the endothelial cells in our arteries and start  narrowing them up.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:48:08):**  It's like a bunch of balloons going through.  But sugar, it can get the large, large dance, it can get in.  And that is what gives us that artery problem.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:48:20):**  Well, if you get the blood work and your triglyceride, your LDL is high, but your triglyceride number  is low, that's from fat.  The LDL is from fat.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:48:33):**  If your triglyceride number is high, you've got problems coming.  I can't remember who it was.  Explain it to me, whether it was on this show or on another one.  
**[0:48:46-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:48:46):**  But when you eat fat, your body can take that and convert that into kind of slow energy.  But when your body eats sugar and simple carbs that it can't burn immediately, it tries to  store those as fat.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:49:07):**  Eating fat doesn't make you fat.  Eating sugar and refined grains and processed food that your body doesn't know what to do  with that either needs to metabolize very rapidly or store immediately.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:49:21):**  And you eat a big spoonful of sugar, you're going to get a sugar rush.  That's the initial hit.  But that's only from just a tiny fraction of the sugar you ate, your body's saying,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:49:32):**  and your liver's going, hey, I got a store this.  So it does a process that I forgot the name of maybe glyco, you know, Genesis or something,  but it takes those sugars and those simple carbs and stuff those into a fat muscle or  
**[0:49:47-0:49:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:49:47):**  or stuff those into a fat cell or stuff those around a muscle just to get rid of them and  keep them hanging out.  Well, that is basically the story that this Dr. Robert Lustig told and you can find him  
**[0:49:59-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:49:59):**  on the internet, you know, on YouTube, 45 minute long talk, you'll get what he's L-U-S-T-I-G  is how to spell the name.  Very interesting talk.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:50:15):**  I don't know what.  I'm a fan of the Weston A. Price Foundation dot org orgy.  There's some very good information there.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:50:28):**  The very first article I ever read on that website was the oiling of America by Mary  Enig, who's dead now.  The best article that I ever read, you can find it online is Yudkin versus Keys.  
**[0:50:45-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:50:45):**  On Yudkin versus Ansel Keys.  That explains why you want to be eating more fat and less concentrated carbohydrates better  than anything else I've ever read.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:51:00):**  Okay.  Another, another thing in the longest ever probably show notes.  So how is what we feed our cow?  
**[0:51:17-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:51:17):**  I guess let me rephrase that.  As we're raising cattle and raising livestock, you know, it takes 120 days for the red blood  cells to completely change out.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:51:28):**  So when we take these animals and I say we as we as the livestock industry, as the cow-calf  industry, not what you or I do specifically, but as we producers, we take our animals and  and plug them into the commodity system, wherever we do, whether we're selling them as a background  
**[0:51:47-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:51:47):**  or whether we're selling as fats, ultimate destination for that animal, probably 95%  of the time is going to be at a big feedlot for 90 to 120 days.  And then after that, you know, it's a short ride on the Jesus bus to freezer camp at Cargill  
**[0:52:02-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:52:02):**  JBS national or whatever the other one is, can't remember.  What if we're the way we feed in a feedlot with a lot of high energy grains, a lot of  corn, a lot of starches, a lot of sugars, and those animals don't get exercise.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:52:21):**  And we don't have to get into the like the hormone modification business in the ionic  pores, like how much of an effect does what that animal eats and what it's taking in affect  human health?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:52:40):**  Well Omega-3s come from the green leafy parts of plants.  Okay.  Omega-6 comes from the grain.  
**[0:52:51-0:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:52:51):**  They say that a perfect diet would be one to one.  The average American is, a good American would be four to one, but I mean, we're anywhere  from that on the good side up to probably to 20 to one.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:53:16):**  And 120 to 50 days on grain, literally you have removed all of the Omega-3s that had  come from grass.  Now does that mean there are no Omega-3s?  
**[0:53:33-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:53:33):**  No, that's not true.  But kind of back to the CAFO model, if you will, more and more people are trying to direct  market and they're taking the better animals and that shape of that animal, I was looking  
**[0:53:51-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:53:51):**  around a minute ago to see if I had a red solo cup sitting here.  The shape of that animal is going to affect how well they digest.  And so lucky for someone that knows Brian and is buying meat from Brian, Brian's picking  
**[0:54:09-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:54:09):**  the best animals and the worst ones are going to the feedlot system where Fred Provenza  wrote a book called Nourishment, excellent book.  And in there, if mom had grain, junior is going to have to have grain to perform up  
**[0:54:26-0:54:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:54:26):**  to its potential.  If mom had grain during utero, in utero, if mom only had forage, junior is going to perform  great on forage, better yet on alfalfa and even better yet on grain.  
**[0:54:40-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:54:40):**  Well, whole methane thing and whatnot.  In the feedlot, 80% of all of the baking soda mined or manufactured in the US is fed to  beef and dairy feedlots to buffer the acid rumen.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:55:01):**  Hold on, did you say 80% of the baking soda used in the United States is fed in feedlots?  Beef and dairy feedlots to buffer the acid rumen.  They get too acid and you get acidosis.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:55:18):**  You didn't get too alkalosis, but I mean that might be 2% of the time or something.  Can we like chase an acid base in the rumen rabbit trail and talk about what that means?  Like what does it mean when the rumen is too acidic?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:55:37):**  What's happening in that fermentation tank?  Well, let's start at alkaline.  You're Gabe Brown, you've got 20 bricks grass, life is good.  
**[0:55:47-0:56:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:55:47):**  The cattle are getting all the minerals they need, their alkaline, their resistance to  disease internal external parasites is very high.  The lower we get on pH, our resistance to disease, internal external parasites, flies,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:56:07):**  lice, pink eye foot rot scours, we get more and more.  While out on grass, if it's low, let's just say it was six bricks grass, but there wasn't  a lot of corn and soy around.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:56:21):**  We're going to have less and we're moving the cattle more often.  We've been doing this for five years.  We're going to have less problem than someone else who's got two bricks grass across from  
**[0:56:32-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:56:32):**  corn and soy and you're getting all of the toxins rolling in.  When fly season starts, you're going to get pink eye at the beginning of the season and  there are other people living in the same area and they maybe get a little bit right  
**[0:56:48-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:56:48):**  at the very end of the pink eye season.  I'm just thinking about pink eye and it shows up because low mineral in the cattle are under  stress whether that's stress from chemicals or the heat or or or anyway a fellow came  
**[0:57:10-0:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:57:10):**  up to me oh man 11 years ago something like that.  He was complaining that 60 to 70 percent of his registered calves had gotten pink eye  that summer.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:57:22):**  This is like November.  We talked about Weston A. Price, Maynard Murray, Carrie Reems went through all of this and  I said that sea salt in the salt shaker or in the mineral box is about 20 percent bioavailable.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:57:37):**  The rest is going out the back of the cow and she's now our fertilizer cart so next  year's grass is better than this year's grass.  Well attached to a carbon atom those minerals are 90 percent bioavailable kelp our grass  
**[0:57:53-0:58:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:57:53):**  that has a mineral.  You make the mineral water we were talking the tea bag a little bit ago it's 50 percent  or more bioavailable.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:58:04):**  Anyway kind of I am not the first person that ever thought about mineral water.  I mean sole it's a French term and it's a mineral water deal but we were making this  in five gallon buckets and backing it out to the cows and it was a learning curve and  
**[0:58:21-0:58:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:58:21):**  it made your back sore.  Anyway I called this gentleman at the end of August the next year.  We both started doing this mineral water that fall and through the winter and you know pretty  
**[0:58:33-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:58:33):**  quick we're getting better at making volumes.  Came up with the tea bag idea.  A friend of mine from New Hampshire came up with the tea bag idea.  
**[0:58:44-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:58:44):**  Anyway I called him at the end of August and said well how was the pink eye this year and  he said not one case and the only thing he did is he gave liquid minerals in nature's  balance to his cattle in nowhere near as much as they would consume.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:59:03):**  I went to Texas I think it would be four years ago in March and I'd never been invited to  herd the cattle that were in more trouble and we made mineral water starting the second  day and he called me up in a week or 10 days and he said man these cattle are drinking  
**[0:59:23-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:59:23):**  at least 75 if not 80-85 percent mineral water and they were coming down off the hill and  the first tank was this new one and then they had to go another 20 yards to the old freshwater  tank and I said well just take your tea bag and stick it in the other tank.  
**[0:59:42-1:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=0:59:42):**  He called me up the next morning he said well that took 20 minutes or 30 minutes to figure  out now they stand in line down at the other tank to get the minerals that were missing.  He was spending over a thousand dollars a month on 118 cows for one of these 16 different  
**[1:00:01-1:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:00:01):**  mineral deals and when I walked on the ranch he had a mineral problem, a toxin problem  and an energy problem and he was spending over a thousand dollars on a brand name multi-mineral  mix.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:00:17):**  Cafe style.  Absolutely and after 45 days he just quit putting that out because they just quit eating  that all they wanted sea salt mineral water conditioner that was about the first six months.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:00:33):**  So I have a very very similar experience with mineral water.  After working cows 196 came out last year listened to it two or three times because  I was on a little bit of a road trip the day it came out so listened to it on the way up  
**[1:00:50-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:00:50):**  and on the way back and had some discussions.  The next day I found a pallet of C90 within an hour drive I went and I got it.  The day after that I was hauling out equipment I have a portable water pump it's solar powered  
**[1:01:04-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:01:04):**  on a trailer so it's a submersible pump I can take that thing and I can throw it into  a stock tank I can throw it a creek I can throw it a pond and then I've got 2,500 feet  of black plastic pipe I can hook to that and move anywhere and I've got two 250 gallon  
**[1:01:19-1:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:01:19):**  portable tanks.  So I brought over a joint of pipe brought the pump set it up to where it was you know  gonna draft out of the stock tank that the cows were on so we're gonna take water from  
**[1:01:30-1:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:01:30):**  the tank that cows have access to we pumped it about 200 feet downhill into that into  the portable pond and that's where I put the mineral water.  The first day I think I put 50 pounds of salt in my burlap bag I came back and checked it  
**[1:01:47-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:01:47):**  in two hours and it was gone so I put 100 pounds in it and I came back in four hours  and checked it and it was gone.  Wasn't anybody standing around wanting water?  
**[1:01:58-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:01:58):**  Gave him a day off let him have fresh water in both tanks.  Second day I came back out first of the morning I threw 150 pounds of salt in the bag and  I left.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:02:09):**  Came back six hours later and it was just just the crumbs in the bottom and I didn't  do it right I mean I switched it around got all the got all the cloudy shit in there and  you know then I threw the bag out but hadn't heard that little bit before that you're just  
**[1:02:22-1:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:02:22):**  supposed to yank it out throw it away.  But toward the end of the second day I started seeing about half of them walk past the mineral  water and go that 200 feet up the hill to drink the fresh water so okay they're probably  
**[1:02:39-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:02:39):**  done so I just went back to feeding salt I'd put out a tub of straight C90 and that's the  product I was using I was using C90 and you can you know we can talk about why why Redmans  or Kansas Independent might be a better product that's that's fine it's what I could get and  
**[1:02:55-1:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:02:55):**  get click.  It is probably more expensive than Redmans or Kansas Independent we can say that.  So two treatments of the C90 mineral water within the next seven days we were headed  
**[1:03:09-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:03:09):**  for a pink eye wreck and we probably had 20 calves that had pink eye in one eye and the  policy this year was to not treat until we had two bad eyes so after we treated the second  calf for two bad eyes one of the customers one of mine that's when we tried the mineral  
**[1:03:29-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:03:29):**  water.  I had several cows that were limping bad feet mine and the customers cows I had one cow  that was down that had just had a calf she was down to maybe 450 pounds skin and bones  
**[1:03:42-1:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:03:42):**  barely traveling look like hell like there she was a chronic problem.  Within two weeks pink eye all disappeared the cadmium humps disappeared all the feet  got better and that chronic I couldn't I can't pick her out of the herd after two weeks she  
**[1:04:03-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:04:03):**  picked up that much condition in two weeks and got traveling better that I couldn't find  her out I couldn't pick her out of the herd other than my tag number.  You just don't know who's going to go there I mean I have other stories but that's it  
**[1:04:20-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:04:20):**  Brian that's a that's a good story.  We also had some blocks that we got from the co-op that my client brought got from the  co-op and one of them is a brown block of salt with iodine and the other one was a salt  
**[1:04:35-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:04:35):**  and trace mineral block.  They quit eating them and so I put out C90 a couple times before we did the mineral water  and you want to haul out 200 pounds a day to 220 head of cattle.  
**[1:04:52-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:04:52):**  Oh that's a lot of salt for the first couple days.  Well I realized they were just trying to get balanced after I did the mineral water trick  salt consumption was low the rest of the year like super super low the rest of the year.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:05:06):**  Well each else through the mineral water is the equivalent of two and a half ounces dry.  The bioavailability right so yeah it just the marginal efficiency of capital yes time  is money to make the mineral water but you're getting two and a half times out of your your  
**[1:05:28-1:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:05:28):**  dollar investment at least after the first week on this every other day one tank with  a float not metal you kind of have that figured out there is a fellow no not gonna not gonna  go there okay I don't you know experiment on your own okay.  
**[1:05:51-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:05:51):**  So back to pink eye comment I had about pink eye you know pink eye has been in the world  ever since I can remember I can remember I was a I was a little fella and dad had a old  hired hand out here on the ranch his name was Ivan and Ivan was up in his 60s by this  
**[1:06:07-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:06:07):**  time and they I remember one year dad was having a wreck with some with some customer  steers and they're having a lot of problems with pink eye so Ivan went to town and he  bought a jar of Morton iodized salt and he put that in a saddle bag and when I found  
**[1:06:27-1:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:06:27):**  one pink eye rope it tie it down and Ivan would take that salt and he'd go up and he'd  just pour it in the bad eye and then kind of close it up and let him sit there for a  minute with that salt in her eye and then let him up his theory was they'll either cure  
**[1:06:46-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:06:46):**  it or to make it so bad they don't care and I seem to remember it working often and that  planted in my mind that pink eye is related to iodine deficiency what do you think about  that?  
**[1:07:04-1:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:07:04):**  Well and that learning curve there in New Meadows you know from one year to the next  okay we need more iodine we need more copper we need more selenium I'm trying to do my  own thing and then it's like okay I got to find those sources but not from China and  
**[1:07:21-1:07:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:07:21):**  that's when things just really got good but the the mix to commercial salts slash mineral  they I just never could get out of having problems with those but what would I say iodine  it's not just one thing they all interact you've seen the wheel with all the arrows  
**[1:07:47-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:07:47):**  going back and yeah they all interact the thing about making the mineral water I mean  you could use ten thousand dollar a ton Himalayan salt or or in Kansas two dollars a bag for  the fine without the treat the clear portion of that water is 92 minerals in nature's balance  
**[1:08:10-1:08:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:08:10):**  cleaner than the water that the Vikings were throwing their trash overboard into people  that are on city or they call it rural water that has chlorine and fluorine added they'll  go after the mineral water a little more than the fresh water to avoid the chlorine and  
**[1:08:30-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:08:30):**  the fluorine it that extra chlorine and fluorine it settles to the bottom of the if you're  doing two tanks to the bottom of the the tank with the with the mineral water in it so that  all you're going to get and that's all explained very well in the sea energy agriculture by  
**[1:08:48-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:08:48):**  Maynard Murray right after World War II the American Navy went around the world multiple  samples of every body of water it was always 92 minerals and they were always exactly in  a certain balance there were more minerals in a gallon of water at the equator warm water  
**[1:09:07-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:09:07):**  than there were at Sica Alaska cold water so think about that in summer versus winter  but it was always 92 minerals a volcanic vana tsunami wave action a month later we're back  to 92 minerals there was an imbalance on the ocean floor well if we put the sea salt in  
**[1:09:28-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:09:28):**  here and leave it set for a while the imbalance is on our new ocean floor that's why you want  to have a little bit of unused sea salt that you're throwing away each time to ensure that  you had enough of every mineral you needed to make perfect ocean water and just to be  
**[1:09:48-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:09:48):**  clear that stuff that's remaining in the bottom of the bag that that does not belong on pasture  no I you know I guess you could you could try putting along the fence row that's what  your electric fence didn't short out but this would be a little bit like the Romans and  
**[1:10:06-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:10:06):**  Carthage you know Matthew what is it 513 once the salt has lost its taste well we took the  taste quote unquote the 92 minerals out of here and what's left is that's where the Romans  on in Carthage where that's left with the fields yeah whatever is left out of the bottom  
**[1:10:26-1:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:10:26):**  of the salt barrel makes sense I make sense because over the last year you know I've heard  that you know well they salted the fields well the guy I bought my c90 from is spraying  it through his irrigation system and he reported he reported pretty good results from that  
**[1:10:45-1:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:10:45):**  and that really got me thinking like salting the fields well c90 says you can even use  it like that Redmond says you can use it like that as a full year spray on cereal crops  or on grain crops okay but that doesn't square with you know salting the fields until you  
**[1:11:03-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:11:03):**  brought up and until you gave me that little nugget that was what did you say when the  salt is used I think it's Matthew 513 once the salt has lost its taste okay well the  taste is those minerals in there people talk about how much more flavorful the these sea  
**[1:11:23-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:11:23):**  salts whether it's the c90 or the Redmond or the the Himalayan yeah there there are  a number of stories about that I don't know I've had people put it through pivots I've  had people go out and spray it dry I mean spray it on Maynard Murray in his book he  
**[1:11:47-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:11:47):**  2200 pounds the acre he'd do 550 spring fall spring fall 2200 and don't call me for five  or ten years well the classic study in there or test I guess is they they had tomatoes  that they planted in a number of different planters and they went up 200 pounds of sea  
**[1:12:07-1:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:12:07):**  salt at a time and then they came along and they sprayed the tomatoes with the virus no  river heard virus anyway they sprayed a virus on these tomatoes that always kills tomatoes  and all of the controls died but a few of the 200 pound lived and a few more of the  
**[1:12:29-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:12:29):**  four and six and eight when they got above 1500 pounds of sea salt to the acre remember  Weston Price all of those groups of people were that that were super healthy they were  eating five to ten times the vitamins and minerals the average American was getting  
**[1:12:48-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:12:48):**  in the 1930s and we don't get half of that today anyway when they got above 1500 pounds  none of the tomatoes died another gentleman he weaned 750 calves so 550 ish pounds deers  heifers average puts him in his feedlot feeds him fairly bland prairie hay and a little  
**[1:13:13-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:13:13):**  bit of corn silage and then you know he started up in the corn silage and 10 ounces of sea  salt per calf per day eight days in he gets a two inch freezing rain I'm telling a vet  friend at a big feedlot he goes I hear the wreck coming I called the gentleman the 17th  
**[1:13:34-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:13:34):**  of January I called him a month after he cleaned those calves and he had still not had one  sick calf well he was feeding five six seven times as much mineral as those calves would  normally ingest he was just mixing it in well that was pretty valuable manure they drank  
**[1:13:55-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:13:55):**  a lot of water but nothing got sick I mean this if we wanted to do this ourselves this  is a quart let's say you put two teaspoons of sea salt in there you don't you can shake  it up or whatever but three or four hours later there'll be a sediment on the bottom  
**[1:14:11-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:14:11):**  so we grab another container and we very carefully pour from the one with that has the sediment  into the other one and when we see this the clouds start to get here we throw this away  drink a pint of that mineral water per adult per day that that's the fastest way to get  
**[1:14:31-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:14:31):**  the minerals back in you I'm glad you mentioned like mineral water for people because I've  noticed I just made some this morning I'll show it to you okay while he's going to get  that a year year and a half ago we got a reverse osmosis water filter installed here at the  
**[1:14:51-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:14:51):**  house and those RO filters are great I like the taste of RO water but it literally takes  everything out and since we've done that I've noticed that every couple of weeks I'll just  get to the point where my brain's a little bit foggy things aren't quite making sense  
**[1:15:09-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:15:09):**  and I'm not feeling the greatest in the world and I can't seem to drink enough water well  what I'll do is I'll get a glass and I'll you know I'll crush some sea salt into it  we use Himalayan pink good I'll put some sea salt at about four inches of water and just  
**[1:15:26-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:15:26):**  swirl that around and then choke that back and within two hours I feel much much better  I don't know if you can see but there's a sorry about how yeah I can see it camera is  there's a cloud so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pour this from one into another here  
**[1:15:46-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:15:46):**  I don't know if you can see oh yeah I see the clouds still staying day way down at the  bottom yeah but when I start to get nervous about the cloud heading towards the lip I'll  just stop and like well here let me see you let it get close no let me you can see how  
**[1:16:07-1:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:16:07):**  cloudy now the bottom the bottom of that is but the clear stuff I usually just get up  and have six or eight swallows in the morning and do it again at noon I've got my pint in  for the day and life is good so and good and I think like a lot of people think that sports  
**[1:16:39-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:16:39):**  drinks like Gatorade and Powerade do the same thing but it seems like none of that crap  in Gatorade is going to be bioavailable Brian we're all going to run into this you need  to mix up some milk replacer for a calf okay or electrolyte for a calf this is your own  
**[1:16:59-1:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:16:59):**  electrolyte but if you're if you're you've got a calf that's sick and you're trying to  I would use at least half mineral water and one tablespoon of coconut oil oh my gosh that  calf will get up way quicker than if you don't use the mineral water and that it's just like  
**[1:17:20-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:17:20):**  adding a quarter of a stick of butter to that calf of the coconut oil and the coconut oil  is just there for the fat for the yeah okay now if you want to know what a hot flash for  a woman feels like you take a tablespoon of coconut oil and within 30 minutes you'll have  
**[1:17:43-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:17:43):**  a good idea of what a hot flash feels like in the winter time you're cold that'll that'll  warm you up as your body's getting that big massive influx of energy that it can either  store or start synthesizing for use way better than that hershey's candy bar the the coconut  
**[1:18:04-1:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:18:04):**  oil yeah I mean now we can go get something done yeah oh that hershey's bar tastes so  good though it makes me feel so good while I'm eating it and so bad after I eat it well  are you trading me are you telling me I have to trade short-term comfort for long-term  
**[1:18:22-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:18:22):**  benefit Steve we can leave it there or we can say this quarter's profits versus profits  ten years down the road I mean how much easier is it to put on a pound than to get it back  off oh I can run a lot of pounds off in a day by being a jackass and just running around  
**[1:18:42-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:18:42):**  in the pasture yeah yeah no you you're exactly right you're exactly right okay we've been  going for a while you're ready to like give us some more thoughts on red solo cup cows  so it'll be about first of May when this comes out I don't know what else you could really  
**[1:19:06-1:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:19:06):**  say about red solo cup cows that I have questions about no I think that was a good question  so this come out the first of May get out there in your herd the cows that are shedding  the earliest better glandular function they're more adapted to your environment that is the  
**[1:19:24-1:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:19:24):**  one thing you can't buy is a cow that is adapted to your environment the cows or heifers that  have not shed off by the time you put the bull in to get them bred they one way or another  they're going to get a check mark they have the lowest glandular function well glandular  
**[1:19:44-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:19:44):**  function and hormones they they go together the taller an animal is in any breed the fewer  sex hormones they're producing so shorter animals are producing more sex hormones because  they shut off long bone growth and estrogen shuts it off if this is the cow's head in  
**[1:20:07-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:20:07):**  the front end of the cow first so she should look like she's walking downhill on level  ground and a bull the testosterone shuts it off in the back first walking uphill rarely  do you see a bull walking uphill before two years of age though but the flatter they are  
**[1:20:25-1:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:20:25):**  on top no no downward rake is a good thing and I I guess in the spring of the year that  a lot of that other stuff it's in those talks but this time of year right now the cows that  shed early that I would write all those down they they are keepers everything else being  
**[1:20:46-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:20:46):**  equal yeah everything that's calved in the first 21 days so the first cycle after we  turn bulls out yeah I've got all them written down and we're going to be watching them over  the next you know 30 40 days every time I go out and I notice one of them starting to  
**[1:21:02-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:21:02):**  slick off you know that's going in the book so Brian you you heard that talk the the 196  on the mineral deal last June June I think it was June mid June maybe Casey so you had  I don't know when do you can I started a month ago and I've got about another 60 days don't  
**[1:21:28-1:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:21:28):**  judge me harshly we're gonna shorten that to probably 65 days and we're gonna go in  the first of July which is going to give us calves about now next okay so where my mind  was going is you didn't get your 120 days before the bull and cow got together however  
**[1:21:47-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:21:47):**  just about the time the cow got pregnant is when you got the clean mineral rich going  yeah I would venture to guess that this year's calf crop is going to look better than last  year's calf crop I'm going to guess that the length of the navel cord this year is probably  
**[1:22:03-1:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:22:03):**  a little longer and maybe slightly larger in diameter but next year's calf crop is going  to be better than this year's calf crop and that's the leap of faith that you know most  people they'll they'll change the mineral to not have the pink eye and whatnot but the  
**[1:22:23-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:22:23):**  real benefit is what shows up a year later in the next year's calf crop their resistance  to disease but the the phenotypic quality of the animal coming out of the cow is is  better than in the past now I I remember hearing you say something about pulling the c90 out  
**[1:22:44-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:22:44):**  of the pasture between 60 and 90 days before when you start calving so I erase that that  was we've we've learned different knowledge no it that was not that think about the the  sodium bentonite clay the redmond conditioner or any of those others they're a member of  
**[1:23:05-1:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:23:05):**  the zeolite family and or maybe it was the redman's product specifically well not not  the salt it was the conditioner and in the the general statement is if if whatever is  going on the conditioner is an optimizer if things are going good they're going to go  
**[1:23:24-1:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:23:24):**  better if you feed the conditioner raises ph promotes the growth of the biology in the  gut binds the neighbor's toxins you spend a dollar on conditioner you get three things  back you spend a dollar on the natural soda out of rifle colorado to raise ph you got  
**[1:23:43-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:23:43):**  one thing back it was a band-aid we didn't fix the problem we can keep putting the band-aid  on the conditioner is going to fix the problem well when your first calf hair first get ready  to cab do you pour the alfalfa to them mine no I treat mine exactly like the cow I treat  
**[1:24:04-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:24:04):**  mine exactly like the cows I wish they were they my campers aren't special okay you don't  do that for a reason which is large cats similarly if if your calves or cows are in very good  shape you could get large calves now if you've got skinny cows at calving you could probably  
**[1:24:25-1:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:24:25):**  feed it that's up to you I'm just some people that have overly conditioned cows have gotten  in trouble because conditioner promotes growth and we don't need it right there at the end  on the inside and I think there's a lot to be said that you can feed condition and fertility  
**[1:24:47-1:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:24:47):**  into damn near anything but can you afford to do that that's that's the deal and that's  why the glandular function the butter fat and in that everything getting bigger she's  getting taller she goes back because she's she's more fertile than the one that's flat  
**[1:25:06-1:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:25:06):**  and the last cow you want is the one that walks uphill on level ground she's got a bigger  belly than the herd average and a wider butt than the herd average so yeah that's that  would give you the red solo cup okay so I guess I guess I had that mistaken about you  
**[1:25:28-1:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:25:28):**  know the conditioner because I took the salt away like I said back in January so I should  probably go put that back in absolutely and actually you can detox with enough sea salt  but yeah I would absolutely put the salt back in absolutely and the mineral water you know  
**[1:25:55-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:25:55):**  whenever it's not freezing where you have to worry about hoses or something and but  if it's one tank this where I was just add up in Montana they had these concrete tanks  they were filling them with a two inch pipe in the middle and they had about 400 cows  
**[1:26:13-1:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:26:13):**  in there and the tank was a little small and so I was having them I said to start let's  put 50 pounds two different tea bags one in opposite corners and come back tomorrow and  see what you've got in there to see if but I said it may take more than 100 pounds altogether  
**[1:26:31-1:26:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:26:31):**  for those cows for one day so they'll as soon as they start irrigating they'll get that  going okay so I wanted to circle back yeah we talk about hair coat which is relates to  glandular function and hormonal balance earlier you made a comment about the horns and I'd  
**[1:26:54-1:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:26:54):**  like to go back to that because the way I understand it and like I said I'm a fairly  uneducated redneck I've never been to college like never taken any animal biology but it's  my understanding that the horns on a cow are basically made of the same thing that hair  
**[1:27:13-1:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:27:13):**  is it's keratin and it's it's a structure that's encased in bone so logically horns  are related to hair coat if they're made of the same stuff and you were saying you were  saying that you could get some indicators and some information by looking at horns you  
**[1:27:30-1:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:27:30):**  want to go back over that sure so Jan Bonsma from South Africa he was here in the 60s and  early 70s and he wrote a book a man must measure I think the better book is Bonsma lectures  for the person first starting out but in there he has a and I've got a copy of that book  
**[1:27:54-1:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:27:54):**  outside but on the red solo cup cow towards the end there's a picture of two skeletons  and it's the back end I'd always been told sex hormones shut off long bone growth sex  hormones shut off long bone growth you know 50 times you get to looking at those two pelvises  
**[1:28:21-1:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:28:21):**  and hang on a second here you get to looking at those two pelvises and one of them has  a much thicker tail and one of them the one on the right has a much smaller in diameter  tail well when I was a kid I heard a broom tail cow that's what I heard okay and I'm  
**[1:28:43-1:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:28:43):**  thinking the part on the ground maybe the fellow said a broom handle tail cow the smaller  in diameter if the if the hide looked the same on the top of one tail was an inch and  a half in diameter and the other one was two and a half inches in diameter the only place  
**[1:29:02-1:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:29:02):**  for it to go is down into the pelvic opening well sex hormones shut off all bone growth  so you've got 25 year old cows out there that just looked like carbon copies of each other  if one of them's got really small in diameter shorter horns that that aren't flaky she's  
**[1:29:26-1:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:29:26):**  more fertile than the one with the largest in diameter and the longest length born I  mean everything else being equal we left the rest of the cow the same well rarely does  that happen but it's just an indicator finer bones shorter in length where the age of the  
**[1:29:45-1:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:29:45):**  cow is more fertile than large bones and and long now long horns there's some people there  in Texas they are tickled with how what do we do here they are tickled with how their  calves are coming out white instead of yellow coats but the horns are now growing longer  
**[1:30:10-1:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:30:10):**  faster in the long horn which is a big deal to longhorn owners not so much to these people  they're trying to get an animal that is phenotypically correct yeah I think those longhorn guys they're  just they're trying to sell inches of horn which and they okay but but he was he was  
**[1:30:28-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:30:28):**  going for the phenotype and good function and as a side note he got and I have about  20 minutes this is the max I've got here I got to go load the truck he as a he's doing  everything else right and the horns are growing longer too okay I was I was in the panhandle  
**[1:30:56-1:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:30:56):**  of Texas here last fall in November and I saw a a corianni bull that was walking up  hills like stop we got to get a picture of this I mean you normally don't think coriannis  is being very masculine beefy five miles later here is a longhorn bull that's walking uphill  
**[1:31:19-1:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:31:19):**  even more than the corianni bull I have a hard time finding English breed bulls that  walk uphill so they were doing what what the book says glands hormones is supposed to do  I have a theory about that okay because the coriannis and the longhorns aren't traditionally  
**[1:31:42-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:31:42):**  part of the production commodity system so you know the people that own them don't treat  them like the people that own the blacks black and red angus cows that feed condition and  fertility onto them all the time one of the reasons I I'm a fan of the corianti breed  
**[1:31:59-1:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:31:59):**  is the the vast minority of corianni producers are feeding them past what they could probably  stand most people just well they're just crap cows we'll just put them out in the pasture  and rope them I mean and that's not even getting into you know the epigenetic history of natural  
**[1:32:16-1:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:32:16):**  adaptation the breed has how much of that's transferred over the last hundred years not  real sure but there's some diamonds in the rough somewhere I mean everybody's cow herd  I think everybody's cow herd has a lot of animals in it that can survive on next to  
**[1:32:32-1:32:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:32:32):**  nothing but it's it's finding those that you're having to feed to make the fertility and condition  because you're not you don't have to feed all of your animals to maintain fertility  and condition there's only a percentage of them that you're feeding to maintain that  
**[1:32:47-1:33:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:32:47):**  the rest of them can probably do it on on a low input program a fellow in western Oklahoma  had bought a number of corianni cows and he was just kind of trading cows and home I was  I was quite tickled with the percentage that were just shiny hair coat compared to the  
**[1:33:07-1:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:33:07):**  wrestling well like you better give those shiny hair coated ones I wouldn't let them  out of your hands for a while that there's your potential for a future herd I mean you're  gonna get rid of these and save this 15-20% and then next year you're gonna buy some others  
**[1:33:23-1:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:33:23):**  I don't know you know what you're gonna do but I wouldn't just sell those really shiny  hair coated ones they're saying I I can get along in this environment with a little bit  of nothing way better than all the rest just what you said yeah those are the ones that  
**[1:33:39-1:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:33:39):**  well none of mine are probably ever gonna go to the barn again but those are the ones  you'd want to sell to people that you like in the area be like exactly open I think she's  a great cow give you a good deal on her just you know she'd get by on damn near nothing  
**[1:33:55-1:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:33:55):**  yeah no we and we talked her we you mentioned earlier about how to get good cows and I kind  of had a rebuttal that I think there's a few ways you can get good cows okay you can make  your own or you can go by the ranch that they're standing on I would I would agree with that  
**[1:34:17-1:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:34:17):**  I was with a fellow on the Arizona strip and there's a Hereford cow with pretty horns and  a monster steer at her side and and we were we were riding and anyway I told him I told  the owner I said man that cow is screaming I love the Arizona strip louder than anybody  
**[1:34:36-1:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:34:36):**  else where'd she come from he said well she came with that last ranch we bought so she  was born there I mean and that is well explained in Fred Provenza's book nourishment yep yep  well this year coming into 22 breeding season 22 I have calves that were born on the ranch  
**[1:34:58-1:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:34:58):**  but they all came either as a pair or as late third trimester and were born on the ranch  it's not going to be until next year that I get a breed ranch raised two-year-olds so  there's there is a crop you know my one-year-old crop that's coming up that'll be 14 to 15  
**[1:35:20-1:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:35:20):**  months when I turn out breed when I turn out bulls to breed and I am going to turn out  a one and a half year old half machona bull to breed the to breed those one-year-olds  and to cover the two-year-olds and I I've only got like 56 or underage cows and I don't  
**[1:35:39-1:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:35:39):**  know if that needs one bull or two probably two so Gerald Wyatt from Australia classic  livestock management services CLMS he said in his last newsletter if you can see a bull's  epididymis on the bottom in the middle of the testicles there you know nove or anything  
**[1:36:06-1:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:36:06):**  they're both like they're supposed to be like drayson said in his book herd bull fertility  you have pretty good assurance that that bull can breed 50 to 60 females in the first 21  days and you know I hear that a lot I mean I I've heard it and I'm not gonna dispute  
**[1:36:29-1:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:36:29):**  that at all but how but is there a way other than DNA and genetic testing to find out of  how many bulls that cat or how many cows that bulk is really going to service two or three  different stories but mom and dad got married in 50 and dad said Joanne whatever you do  
**[1:36:50-1:37:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:36:50):**  when you go to Brian's don't ask him how many cows he's got that's like how much money you  got in the bank counties cows multiply times 50 you'll be real close went to did you mean  count bulls and multiply by 50 count bulls and multiply times 50 you'll be real close  
**[1:37:08-1:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:37:08):**  what did I say county's cows I met both you said cows okay I met both so you can see how  far it slipped in 70 years anyway went to Bastrop Texas and picked out six aka so red  Japanese cattle moved him to the mountains of Idaho put them out with some black Angus  
**[1:37:31-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:37:31):**  cows and 11 months we know nine months later they're born and then 10 and a half 11 months  their DNA and those animals and they found one of those bulls bred 107 another 173 and  another 159 after moving them from you know Austin Texas clear to the mountains of Idaho  
**[1:37:55-1:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:37:55):**  Frankie Thorn had a bull pawpaw who at six and a quarter years of age his shoulders were  eight and a half inches wider than the length of his rump he put them out with a men you  know this is all his genetics now for a while he put them out with 100 heifers 14 15 months  
**[1:38:15-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:38:15):**  of age this is a huge bull yeah in a 4600 acre field okay and 60 days later 92 of them  were pregnant but it was a long walk home okay so it's possible but the more fertile  the heifers are sorry this is public but the more wantonness there is in the heifers in  
**[1:38:41-1:39:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:38:41):**  a situation like that their hormones are going to have to say hey where is he it's my time  they're going to be chasing him around well yeah there's going to be some of that to be  able to get this so it it's both sides but it's both sides not from the way most people  
**[1:39:00-1:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:39:00):**  describe it it's both sides because you did the right thing selecting males and females  to go back in the herd and and you got them mineralized purebred animals purebred corn  takes more minerals than hybrid corn or black baldy cows the crossbred cow or corriente  
**[1:39:26-1:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:39:26):**  crossed with whatever else looks good there we go well and one of the reasons they work  is because the minerals in that ground behind you are not as good as before white man showed  up i i would agree with that i mean even though let's just say over 90 of the ranch has never  
**[1:39:49-1:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:39:49):**  been tilled has never been farm soil never disturbed i yeah one of that's that's a pretty  nice little pocket of undisturbed native range and i call it old growth grassland i love  that okay so we can have native range yeah we can have native range you can take a farm  
**[1:40:12-1:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:40:12):**  field and put native grasses and native forbs back on it and call that native range that's  great i have a bunch of old growth grassland that has never been disturbed by a plow much  better off much better off yeah the the the people with what you have get by on average  
**[1:40:33-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:40:33):**  quite a bit better than those who have tried to put it back to grass after someone mined  the minerals out of there then it takes a while to get the minerals back probably ought  to finish up here in five minutes because i thought i got to label something down there  
**[1:40:49-1:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/61-Steve-Campbell-e1hd0gt#t=1:40:49):**  too so well let's uh well then let's just go ahead and head on out of here steve you  have given us a ton of resources and i know you've got to go to uh to ship some product  out here in just a few minutes so before you go um what can you run through where you're

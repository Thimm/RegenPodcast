Got a special one for you today.  My buddy, my pal, CK is with me in the co-pilot seat.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:01):**  This time from Idaho, long distance.  Our guests today are the Hoy family from Clements, Kansas.  They're my friends.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:09):**  We've done a little business together in the past.  And I'm actually slotting this really fast in the release schedule.  As you're going to be listening to this, I'm going to be at the Hoy's on a horse if you're  
**[0:01:22-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:22):**  listening to this on release day.  So I'll be on a horse for the first time in 20 plus years.  So I'm sure that'll be a fun experience.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:32):**  I'm really looking forward to getting to go hang out with the Hoy family and see their  beautiful ranch.  So guys, we had a great conversation.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:40):**  Stick around.  Here we go with Josh, Gwen and Josie Hoy.  Hello, thank you for having us.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:48):**  Yep, thanks for having us.  We're excited to be here.  Well, we're excited to have you guys here.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:01:55):**  So first thing up, you guys won the Kansas Leopold Award recently, yes?  We did.  Last year, my sister nominated us and it was quite an honor.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:02:07):**  I feel like I'm in pretty rarefied company with your father and Bill Sproll and everybody  else who's won it.  It's pretty exciting.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:02:13):**  So the nomination is a pretty rigorous process, right?  Yeah, my sister spent a lot of time writing up the application and nominating us.  It was a bit humbling when I saw the kind of work she put into doing that and it was  
**[0:02:35-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:02:35):**  pretty nice.  It made us feel very good.  We'd had a couple rough years there and wow, that was a nice way to come out.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:02:44):**  So hopefully we'll circle back to that later.  So let's talk about the ranch.  Where are you guys at?  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:02:52):**  Where exactly is Clements?  Sure.  So Clements is just right in the heart of Chase County, which of course is right in  
**[0:03:00-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:03:00):**  the heart of the Flint Hills here in Kansas, the eastern third of Kansas.  Tallgrass Prairie, it would have been historically the western edge of the Tallgrass Prairie,  not like the tallgrass it would have had back in Iowa and northern Missouri with 12 foot  
**[0:03:14-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:03:14):**  tall grass and all, but still through Tallgrass Prairie.  We get quite a bit of moisture and we have a lot of good grass and a lot of good forbs  and rich enough soils that we can really grow some too.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:03:28):**  And none of that ranch has ever been farmed, correct?  Well, a few acres have.  We have kind of a strange amalgamation here.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:03:40):**  We have property that we own and then a couple of cooperating landlords own and the most  recent piece, the Coin Creek piece is just now, just this year was seeded back to native  grass and there's only about 60 acres there that were still being farmed.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:03:59):**  We had probably about that many acres on the original property we bought and we just let  it go back naturally.  We didn't plant it back or anything.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:04:08):**  We just quit farming it and just started grazing it in 1996 and now it's excellent quality  prairie.  I mean, it'll never be the same as the virgin, but it's still, it's come back really well.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:04:22):**  We have a lot of good native species and a lot of diversity coming in.  I would probably tend to agree that once it's been farmed and farmed for quite a while,  it's never going to be as good as what was just on the other side of the plow edge.  
**[0:04:38-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:04:38):**  There's one spot on our ranch up here on the north end on the river bottom that one little  section it's about, oh about five acres, was never, never plowed and all the ground around  it, they started working it in the 1870s and it was farmed right up until 1998 when we  
**[0:05:02-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:05:02):**  got it.  The elevation is three feet lower than that native grass, that kind of triangle of native  grass that sticks out in it.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:05:12):**  And that's a pretty vivid illustration of just what happened in that hundred years.  Three feet.  Yeah, three foot difference in elevation between that native prairie and part of that, it caught  
**[0:05:28-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:05:28):**  a lot of, you know, filth and stuff over the years, I'm sure.  So it actually built up and the farm ground just kept eroding and eroding.  We had, it's pretty poor soil for river bottom.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:05:39):**  It's not like, you know, your big deep black soil at some places.  It's kind of washing stuff and it just never should have been farmed to begin with, but  it was farmed for over a hundred years and it shows.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:05:53):**  How long do you think it would take to get back to even half, so a foot and a half of  soil building?  You know, I really don't know on that.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:06:04):**  I think, you know, if we had the money to really go in and plant a really good for mix  with, you know, 50 or 60 forbs and five or six grasses and really worked at it and really  did like strip grazing, really intense strip grazing, you know, maybe we could add a quarter  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:06:23):**  of an inch of soil a year, maybe.  I don't know, maybe.  I don't know.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:06:30):**  It'd be, I'd love to find out sometime, but at least we're getting thatch on it and we're  getting a diverse number of species out there again and it's coming back.  It's just going to take a long time, but we like to plan things out a few hundred years  
**[0:06:44-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:06:44):**  in advance anyway.  So that's kind of our, our system anyways, to do long-term planning.  I think that's kind of one of those, one of those important concepts.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:06:54):**  You know, we hear that a lot in, in the Ranching for Profit curriculum and in holistic management  is think down the line and what are you going to be leaving behind for six, seven generations  down and make sure that you're making decisions, sound decisions now that aren't going to have  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:07:12):**  profound negative effects down the line for your descendants.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:07:18):**  And you know, 90% of our job here, you know, we're in Paul Graff's Prairie with good rainfall,  excellent quality, Virgin Prairie, most of it.  Our main job is just to stay the hell out of the way and let nature, you know, be nature.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:07:32):**  Because if, if you start messing with it, that's when you start having problems.  It can just stay out of the way and just make a couple changes, just enough, you know, from  bison to cattle or whatever those few management changes are.  
**[0:07:45-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:07:45):**  It's going to just be the humming system that goes right along if you just let it.  It's just on the few little areas that were farmed or were changed drastically that we  have to make any major interdictions and big changes in engineering, I guess.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:08:00):**  Well, that that gives me a great opportunity to kind of segue into management, because  I'd like to talk about how y'all manage the flying W with, like you said, kind of with  minimum interference.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:08:14):**  You bet.  So our whole management philosophy is just nature plus three or four.  So we try to just take the natural system and maybe make two or three or four management  
**[0:08:29-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:08:29):**  decisions that alter it enough that we can get economic benefit from it, but not alter  it negatively and perhaps alter it positively.  So, you know, just a real basic one instead of running instead of, you know, having buffalo,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:08:46):**  which that's just we could be a buffalo ranch, but a migratory herd of buffalo isn't going  to be here anymore.  So we have to use cattle and get them to act like migratory buffalo.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:08:57):**  And that's one one decision.  And then how we manage those cattle on the landscape is next.  You know, we don't use electric fence.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:09:07):**  We don't use a lot of fencing.  We try to influence their behavior with every tool we have.  Like, you know, of course, mineral and feed placement.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:09:18):**  But also we use instinctive migratory grazing and stockmanship to influence those cattle  to go where we want them to and not stay where we don't want them to.  And we've had we started doing that right when in 1996, when my cousin and I partnered  
**[0:09:35-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:09:35):**  up on the plate, that's when we decided right then I decided I didn't want to build electric  fence.  I wanted to use stockmanship and herding to get our cattle to do what we wanted to do.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:09:47):**  And you said you started you have a full time herder.  Oh, sorry, Brian.  Oh, go ahead, CK.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:09:51):**  Does that mean you have a full time herder like with her?  So we don't have any employees.  It's just the three of us, Gwen and Josie and I.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:10:03):**  We you know, this time of year, we we need to be out there constantly just kind of getting  them started and trained the yearlings that are only here for 90 days.  Put a lot of work in at first, but once they've been here and once you get to handling them  
**[0:10:18-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:10:18):**  a bit in the right way, it doesn't take a full time herder.  You just every few days you go out and you tune on a little bit, get them to make sure  they haven't drifted off or something, you know, a storm or something hasn't disrupted  
**[0:10:31-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:10:31):**  them and drawn them someplace you don't want them.  We gathered some we have a group of commercial cows that we keep year round for a customer.  And we gathered them on Monday, I think it was, and got sorted some cattle off of them,  
**[0:10:49-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:10:49):**  put them together and drifted and where we wanted them to go put them on a grazing path.  And they're still grazing right along there today.  So we'll probably go out and bump them, move them a little bit and point them in another  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:03):**  direction and get them going in another part of the pasture.  And so you know, once a week is about enough for there.  And those cows actually have just been put together this spring.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:12):**  So they aren't really tuned into our our methods yet.  But they're getting better every time we interact with them.  I'm really, really looking forward to being there this weekend.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:23):**  And you know, as we record this, we're not going to be releasing it's still about mid  June.  Something to look up look forward to on the podcast is I'm going to be able to sit down  
**[0:11:35-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:35):**  with the Hoy family and with Bob Kinford and talk about some of these instinctive migratory  grazing things that we're talking about.  And hopefully, in a later show, be able to sit down with Bob and explain what we're talking  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:49):**  about.  I look forward to listening to that show with Bob.  That'll be very enlightening.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:11:56):**  I kind of looking forward to meeting Bob in a couple of days.  I've heard your voice of nature.  That's what I've heard.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:07):**  I follow it.  Yeah, I follow him on Facebook.  And I always find everything so interesting.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:12):**  So I'm a little bit envious of you, Brian, that you get to do that.  You could have you were invited, but I guess you wanted to go you needed to go to Idaho.  Oh, that's okay.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:23):**  Oh, yes.  I renovating my house you guys I'd rather do that and go sit with Bob.  That sounds right.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:32):**  Well, it's also going to be my first time on a horse for like, I don't know 20 years.  So get ready for that one.  We'll get video and post that social media just if there's anything embarrassing that  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:44):**  happens Brian.  Yeah.  What was the name of that horse?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:49):**  You said you're gonna put me on?  Well, we thought we'd try Widowmaker grave digger one or the other.  I'm not sure which.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:12:55):**  Okay.  Okay, fair enough.  I'll make sure my health insurance is paid up and I've got my card in my pocket.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:04):**  We'll have a nice good horses.  That's a lot of fun and easy to do.  So working cattle, working cattle with horses is just a joy for us.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:15):**  We just really enjoy it.  So yeah, then you will too.  We like sharing it.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah.  And it's, it's my understanding that you're the real you're the real stockman of the operation  or stock woman that kind of heads up all the horseback and the herding.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:29):**  Is that is that true?  Well, I, I absolutely love doing it.  I didn't grow up doing it.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:37):**  My, I grew up on a farm and we had cattle and horses and everything like that.  And lots of pigs actually, we're a pig farm, which Josh finds hilarious at times.  But I didn't really learn stockmanship or horsemanship until I moved here to the Flint  
**[0:13:56-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:13:56):**  Hills region in, I think it was 92.  And then I really didn't pick up on a lot of things till I met Josh and just working  together the two of us is just been, been so lucky to have had that opportunity.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:11):**  And and also, you know, both of us just love learning.  So we keep, you know, learning more about stockmanship and horsemanship and doing it  together just makes it better.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah.  Awesome.  Awesome.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:26):**  So let's let's backtrack just a little bit and and talk about the ranch.  What pre 2020 I suppose you guys had some interesting things go on there on there, didn't  you?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:42):**  Yeah.  I guess is it okay if I kind of go back to the beginning on the ranch?  Oh, yeah, sure.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:47):**  Let's hear the whole story.  Okay.  Okay, you bet.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:14:51):**  Well, I guess in the beginning, I started out, I just was a day work cowboy.  And I, I cowboyed in 14 different states on dozens and dozens of different branches all  over the western US and even up in Maine and back east a little bit in a few spots.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:15:10):**  And this was but the Flint Hills was everywhere I went to Flint Hills was still a better spot  to have a ranch.  And in 1996, I had an opportunity, my cousin who I'd grown up with, he lived in California,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:15:26):**  we lived in Kansas, of course, he back when in my teenage years, I'd go out and work at  their feed mill and family place out there in the winters.  And we were close.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:15:39):**  He and his brothers had just kind of accidentally sold the family business.  And he was just a year older than me and almost pretty much retired.  He said, Hey, let's start a ranch.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:15:51):**  And so we bought some property and partnered up.  And he was the world's best partner.  For years and years, he got killed in plane crash in 2004.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:16:01):**  And with his mother, and so that kind of changed the landscape for us.  But he and I partnered in 96.  He had Asperger's syndrome and communication was not a strong point.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:16:15):**  He had a lot of trouble communicating with most people.  But since he and I had grown up together, we communicated quite well together.  So it was a great partnership.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:16:24):**  When he died, we had to, his brothers, you know, stayed in partnership with us, thank  goodness gave us enough time to dig out of the hole and be able to buy them out this  year.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:16:37):**  And we lost track of what was it?  So after he died, we had to borrow an obscene amount of money to pay death tax.  It was the most expensive year in American history to die.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:16:55):**  At that time when he died, he was a young man and didn't have his estate set up for,  you know, what it should have been maybe and we borrowed a lot of money to pay for that.  And over the years, we were able to dig out of that, partly through agriculture, but mainly  
**[0:17:11-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:17:11):**  through agritourism.  So we started a guest ranch operation.  We'd already been doing some guest ranch things since 1999.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:17:21):**  But in 2004, we went full bore into it because it was the only way we could see that we could  make a payment and get out of the hole we were in.  And so we just dove right in with horseback riding and lodging and cattle drives and catering  
**[0:17:37-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:17:37):**  and all kinds of stuff.  We grounded out for about almost 20 years there, I guess, 18 years or so.  And COVID kind of put a halt to that?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:17:52):**  Yeah, it was a great business.  We loved it.  And my gosh, we made great money.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:17:57):**  We made lifelong friends out of it, made wonderful connections.  And I think we had an impact on our region as far as, you know, fire in the Flint Hills,  burn, you know, pasture burning and stuff, the public perception of that.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:18:12):**  And  Well, we used, you know, every event that we had or group that came in, we always educated  that was one of our strong points was, you know, educating and giving people a connection  
**[0:18:27-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:18:27):**  back to the land or ranching or, you know, conservation and anything that we were doing.  Every horseback ride, every cattle drive, every event we did, we were always educating  people about the prairie ecosystem and conservation and cowboy culture and ranching culture and  
**[0:18:46-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:18:46):**  history.  Yeah, that was one of our main drivers, making money being the primary one, too, but educating  the public we thought was a really important thing to do.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:18:56):**  And we loved it.  But when COVID hit, we had to shut down.  And once we shut down, we just couldn't open back up.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:19:04):**  We decided we really needed to retire from that and just do some ranching for a while.  And so we did, we shut things down and, and realized just how exhausted we were, and how  strung out we were from trying to work essentially two or three full time jobs instead of just  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:19:23):**  ranching.  And we kind of had that moment of quiet.  That's when we were like, okay, we're, we're going to change some things up.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:19:30):**  And fortunately, we were able to do that.  We shut down the business and, and just focused on ranching.  And it's worked out so far.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:19:39):**  And we're probably going to, we will of course, continue with education, outreach and stuff  and trying to influence people to love the Flint Hills, love the tall grass and love  ranching and cowboy culture too, of course.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:19:53):**  So I think we'll probably do, you know, start adding back some events and stuff in the future  here.  But on a much more limited scale and a less invasive tourism business, you know, the full  
**[0:20:10-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:10):**  scale lodging and catering and horseback riding was a great moneymaker, but boy, it was intense  labor.  365 days a year and just non stop.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:23):**  Yeah.  And which was a good thing.  But you don't like just that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:28):**  I don't think you realize quite how I guess tired you get until you get a little break  from it.  So there you go.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:35):**  Sometimes it's almost like the big reset or a ranching reboot.  Is that cheesy?  Yeah, no.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:45):**  That's dead on.  Ranching is very easy.  We got rebooted.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:20:51):**  Yeah.  So you mentioned fire and the Flint Hills.  Let's talk about burning a little bit.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:21:00):**  I do a fair amount of burning myself here in the Red Hills.  Our fire season is kind of, we're kind of on a break on fire season.  We're shifting a lot of our burning into the summer months because it's easier.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:21:14):**  Let's talk about how you guys use fire.  Well traditionally here in the Flint Hills, we never lost our fire cultures.  Most parts of ranching country lost their fire culture.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:21:27):**  Original fire culture on the Great Plains and Western US was the native Americans that  used fire for both attracting bison and attracting game and just controlling their environment.  And then the early European settlers that came out here, a lot of them just started  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:21:46):**  right on or just kept right on with it.  They saw the value in it.  Lots of areas in Kansas quit doing that.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:21:54):**  They quit burning.  I know there's several famous editorials in newspapers saying that the practice of pasture  burning is a savage practice that civilized decent people should let go of and never do  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:07):**  again.  And I guess we're not civilized or decent here in the Flint Hills because we kept right  on doing it.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:14):**  Your place also didn't get covered up with trees like everything else in Kansas is getting.  Exactly.  Up around Manhattan where K-State had a stronger influence, there's a lot more cedar trees  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:28):**  up there.  And down here where K-State didn't have as much influence, there's a lot more open  country.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:34):**  It doesn't take long to get turned into a scrub forest if you don't use fire in this  context.  Yeah, I've been in Manhattan only like eight months now and I just can't believe they  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:46):**  don't notice that that's an issue.  Yeah.  I think they're kind of used to it now.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:53):**  Yeah.  It's like the frogs in the boiling pot.  They don't know the water's getting hot.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:22:57):**  Yeah.  It is.  Yep.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:00):**  It's not bad, but we don't burn every year like a lot of people in the Flint Hills do.  We burn every three to five traditionally.  In just the last few, we've started doing a patch burning system where we burn a third  
**[0:23:13-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:13):**  of our acres a year and leaving two-thirds unburnt every year.  We're actually throwing an extra year into that of no burning on all the acres in there.  So it'll be a four-year system of patch burning.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:29):**  And the reason we're doing that is we want to leave at least a third of our ranch in  heavy thatch every year for wildlife and bird habitat and also for drought proofing.  That heavy thatch is like a sponge.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:43):**  Any drop of rain you get, you keep.  And so that's kind of nice to have if you can.  And we're only 30 days away from a drought.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:55):**  Always.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:23:58):**  And maybe two weeks.  You just never know.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:01):**  It's always on the verge, aren't we?  And we better be quiet.  People in the drier parts of this country get kind of jealous when we talk about drought  
**[0:24:09-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:09):**  in this country because our version of drought is a lot different from theirs.  But yeah, the other part of the patch burning is that if you were holding that fuel for  three or four years, when you do burn it, oh my gosh, you get a lot better brush control  
**[0:24:25-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:25):**  and tree control.  We're doing a lot of fall burning and summer burning too.  It just has such a bigger impact on brush and trees.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:35):**  And for lespedeza control, it seems to be very effective.  And even old world blue stem seems to be negatively affected by late summer and early fall burns.  And it seems to be invigorated by early spring burns.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:48):**  So I would agree with the sericea in the old world.  Sericea is not a problem here yet.  I'm far west of it.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:24:56):**  They're just dry enough that it's hard for sericea to get here.  But you know, cedars are a problem and old world blue stem.  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:25:07):**  It's just everywhere.  And what I noticed with it, I burned some in the fall or late summer of 18, I think  it was.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:25:18):**  And I grazed it fairly hard in 19.  And last year I strip grazed it and there was a part that we locked the cows on and  just hammered it.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:25:29):**  I think we were at half a million pounds for about six hours.  And they've kind of done a number on it.  And in that same paddock, I've talked about this before with Dallas Mount from RMC, we  
**[0:25:47-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:25:47):**  had a 14 foot wide lane that we had, you know, for our polywire.  And where that lane was, it rained, it was late May, it rained a whole bunch and that  lane was just totally chewed up.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:00):**  I thought that's trash, whatever.  Okay, it's, you know, it's less than an acre out of 100 acre pasture on the whole ranch.  I'm not gonna care.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:08):**  We'll just watch it and see what happens.  Came back late in the summer.  And instead of Old World Bluestem, it was six, seven foot tall, big blue.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:17):**  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:20):**  Did I just see you say, share the reason why I could never say it guys.  Sorry.  It's on Mars now.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:31):**  It's literally throwing on Mars.  Well, there was an article, I think Smithsonian article that we've, we've already seeded Mars  with bacteria and it's considered an invasive species there, of course.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:26:44):**  And so I made the joke that, Oh, Sericea lespedeza is on Mars already, but they better start  fall burn.  So

One ranch at a time.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:06):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Although I think it's starting to swing there.  I think the tide changing.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:14):**  The first year we burned in a summer burn, like summer burn, we had the cops called on  us.  We had neighbors come by and scream and yell at us and really stirred up some hornets nests,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:26):**  which I don't give a damn about that.  I figure if my neighbors don't think I'm crazy and need to be hung for it, then I'm probably  not doing the right thing anyway.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:35):**  So if I'm making my neighbors mad, oftentimes I feel like I'm doing the right thing.  But and it is my guess we had a 60% reduction.  That's just, you know, anecdotal, but visually a 60% reduction in lespedeza in that field  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:50):**  in that pasture that we burned that first time.  And that sold me immediately.  I was like, okay, this we can work with this because my dad had spent 20 years hiring a  
**[0:27:58-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:27:58):**  neighbor to spray, spot spray that to try to keep lespedeza out.  He was an early adapter to fighting the stuff.  And in that 20 years, it's only gotten worse.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:28:08):**  You know, the spot spraying will knock it back a while and then it's back worse and  it doesn't seem to do much.  And we've really shrunk it down to maybe a tenth of what it was when we first started.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:28:22):**  And you know, we we aren't going to completely eradicate it, but we're sure keeping it controlled  and seem to be improving every year.  Are you just getting that control with fire with well timed fire?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:28:36):**  We well done fire.  We've tried a few other things and grazing and stuff.  Quite frankly, and we we got some cows using IMG to just really camp on it early in the  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:28:49):**  spring when it was still fairly palatable.  And we thought, oh, man, we're doing something here.  And they grazed it pretty hard.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:28:58):**  And it invigorated that stuff and made it like a carpet.  You know, I mean, of course it did grazing animals and invigorate plants if you get it  to do it right.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:29:07):**  So that was a mistake.  We don't want to do that again.  That's good to know.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:29:14):**  Yeah, you can really spread that stuff to grazers, right?  But last year, and we're really seeing the results this year, we went in and we brush  hogged some early before it had a chance to go to seed, but after it was palatable to  
**[0:29:31-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:29:31):**  animals.  And then we went in and burned and we got a lot better kill and burn on it because you  know, we can created thatch and dried matter.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:29:40):**  So it really had some intense fire.  And then in other patches where it was, you know, more kind of sporadic and just patches  around a pasture, we went in and we actually sprayed with diesel fuel and then burnt the  
**[0:29:54-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:29:54):**  patch around it and then went back and re-burned anything with just a little mini flamethrower  just to make sure we got an absolute kill on all the stems and everything.  And so far, nothing sprouting up or anything this year.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:30:10):**  We're really eager to see what the results are of that.  But what we were doing was trying to get like a 500 year intense fire on specific spots.  Because we noticed when we had a really hot fire one year, that the humidity was really  
**[0:30:24-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:30:24):**  low and the wind really picked up.  We didn't mean to burn quite as much as we did in September.  And wow, that really knocked it back.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:30:35):**  So we've just tried to mimic that intense heat and fire.  And we have high hopes for that.  Since then, I have acquired a old Forest Service flamethrower and I can throw napalm on this  
**[0:30:49-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:30:49):**  stuff.  And we're planning on napalming all of our lespedeza patches this summer.  I knew we were friends for a reason, Josh.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:30:57):**  I was going to say, can I come visit when you do that?  Absolutely.  You bet.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:03):**  Yeah.  We did a, Josh and Josie ran it a little bit.  We did a couple of trials on some cedar trees and some locusts.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:12):**  And it was devastating.  It is very satisfying to throw napalm at something for an extended period of time.  Yes.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:22):**  Do you think it'll work on oxtails?  I don't know.  You know, our main focus with it is the lespedeza, but mainly trees.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:31):**  And so we're trying some experiments this year.  We're going to burn around the base of hedge trees and locust trees and see if we can kill  them just by scorching the bait.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:42):**  And then go back later and try to burn them in place.  It's just an experiment at this point, but cedar trees, my gosh, you can just light them  up and they're gone.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:31:54):**  Some of my favorite things to burn.  I'm sitting here, Josh, and my mind is spinning.  Like ecotourism and ranch tourism and a flamethrower and melding all of those ideas.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:32:09):**  I think maybe get a flamethrower on a horse.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:32:14):**  Well, maybe like World War II tank or something instead.  I don't think horses and flamethrowers are going to mix well.  Yeah, I see that ending poorly for everybody involved.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:32:26):**  Absolutely.  Yeah, the flying W. Guest Ranch, come drive a tank with a flamethrower and light some  cedar trees on fire.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:32:37):**  Having just gotten out of what, 15 years of paying very high liability insurance, I don't  think I want to even broach that subject with an insurance agent.  That is an excellent point.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:32:54):**  I didn't think about liability insurance for something like that.  That'd be pretty absurd.  So problematic.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:06):**  So what are some of the best resources and education you guys have had over the last  two decades?  Almost 25 years now?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:17):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Ranching for profit.  That was a really good one.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:23):**  That was one of the first schools that I went to and boy, it really changes the way you  look at your operation, kind of opens your eyes to other operations and helps you start  making connections with other people and gets you out of your paradigm blindness a lot of  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:42):**  times.  So that was excellent.  Paradigm blindness is a good way to put it.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:49):**  Oh, boy.  Yeah, a lot of the world has blinks.  It has blinders on, don't they?  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:33:56):**  Yeah.  Well, and we all do in our own way.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:02):**  I was really fortunate.  All those years I spent just cowboying, I was lucky.  I got hired on several ranches that were ranching for profit ranches.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:14):**  People that had been either Savory School or Stan Parsons School.  And boy, they stood out.  Like Pete Farrell.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:23):**  He was one of the only operators in the Flint Hills that was really hiring a lot of day  workers, doing big interesting things.  And so early on I realized that that was where I needed to focus.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:39):**  When I was just cowboying, life was pretty easy.  I didn't even have a checking account or pay taxes.  I just say that on, oh, dear.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:48):**  Edit that out.  We'll edit it out, yeah.  I spent years living in my car and just traveling around.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:34:55):**  But when I decided to partner up with my cousin and become a rancher, I realized quickly that  I needed to get an education, and not a traditional one by any means.  I auto-didact.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:35:09):**  I like to read and read and read.  But I just realized the outfits that were innovative and felt alive and like they were  really doing something were all ranchers that had been, were managing holistically in some  
**[0:35:27-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:35:27):**  way.  And most of them were ranching for profit alumni.  And so I talked to Pete Farrell and he suggested I go to school, I think it was in Colorado  
**[0:35:39-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:35:39):**  Springs.  And it was right, either right at the beginning of Executive Link, and a lot of Executive  Links or potential Executive Link members were at that school.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:35:49):**  Stan Parsons actually taught the school.  And I went to that and wow, was that amazing.  I just, it just was a life-changing event.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:35:59):**  It was excellent.  Yeah, that would, that lines up with the late 90s, I think.  Because I think Executive Links started in like 97, 8, somewhere right along there?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:36:08):**  Yeah, I think this was, school was in 96 and I think it was Executive, they were talking  about forming Executive Links and they were just kind of on the verge of doing it.  And I think your dad was there, I know Kit Barrow was there.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:36:25):**  There were a lot of heroes there.  So it was pretty good room to be in.  I remember dad telling me that he was on one of the first boards and it lasted two, maybe  
**[0:36:36-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:36:36):**  three years and then a bunch of them failed or, you know, it didn't work.  I mean, of course, learning experiences, growing pains.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:36:45):**  But the board that he's on now, and I say that he's on now, they don't come to chapter  meetings.  It's almost more of a social club.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:36:55):**  They are the second, they're the second oldest and they might now be the oldest that still  that still talk and meet regularly.  Wow.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:37:04):**  So yeah, 30, almost 30 years of working together on a program and being able to look inside  somebody else's business and with an objective eye and be able to help them out, challenge  their paradigms.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:37:19):**  That's what the value is for me is having other minds challenge my paradigm.  Yeah, the outside perspective is so important.  I know early on at that school, you know, at that time, it was just me and my cousin  
**[0:37:37-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:37:37):**  and no other input really in management stuff.  And they said, just grow your team.  I don't care if it's, you know, just getting a neighbor, a friendly neighbor or a professional  
**[0:37:52-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:37:52):**  that's interested in your business or anything, but just get more, more eyes on things and  get more people involved.  They don't have to be necessarily actual stakeholders, but if they have an interest or a, or just  
**[0:38:05-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:38:05):**  even a shared interest, that that's enough.  And you just kind of get a board of directors, whether it's formal or informal.  And that's a powerful piece of advice, getting outside eyes on things and outside opinions.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:38:16):**  Boy, that's the way to shatter paradigms and keep you and keep yourself from getting, you  know, in that rut.  So any, any of those big paradigms come to mind that you guys have managed to work through  
**[0:38:29-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:38:29):**  lately?  Um, gosh, what, uh, I was so lucky because, you know, starting out, I didn't have any  hay equipment or farm equipment.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:38:39):**  I wasn't calving in, you know, January, anything like that.  I didn't have an existing ranch.  So I started with a blank slate and was able to avoid a lot of those, you know, traditional  
**[0:38:52-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:38:52):**  pitfalls that people get stuck in, um, or just never get out of mired in, I guess.  Um, and in some ways that was a little depressing almost because, you know, I, I visit with  other people and they could just make two or three changes and all of a sudden they  
**[0:39:08-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:39:08):**  were a lot more profitable and a lot, you know, things were good.  Well, I, I started without those problems, so I had to make things, you know, right.  Just, just as they were, there were no easy fixes.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:39:19):**  I had to just, you know, kind of fine tune things, but, um, uh, what are our big paradigms?  Well, one of the things we were in the paradigm, but we had to stay in the dude business until  last year.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:39:32):**  And once we were kind of, you know, nudged out of that rut, all of a sudden we realized,  wait, we don't have to stay in the dude business anymore.  We can, we can exit this gracefully right now.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:39:44):**  And we'd always planned on phasing out of that business, but it was always in five years  and it just kept being in five years.  We'll phase out in five years to phase out pretty soon.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:39:53):**  That's, you know, 10 more years down the road.  That sounds familiar.  So let's, uh, let's rabbit trail over to your cows and let's talk about your cows.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:40:07):**  Full disclosure to the audience.  I did buy some cows from Josh and Gwen and way.  I understand that was a little bit more Josie's project.

**[0:40:23-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:40:23):**  We, uh, um, she's right here, Brian.  Maybe I should have give her a little warning.  She's well, uh, yeah.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:40:37):**  So our cows are, um, I guess, do you want just a little history on our herd?  Yeah, history on your herd and why.  Okay.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:40:48):**  Okay.  You bet.  So, um, when we started out, we just did custom cattle care.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:40:55):**  We just brought in yearlings mainly.  And then later on we started adding some cows, year round cows and just summer cows.  And that we really didn't get into the cow calf business early on just because we didn't  
**[0:41:06-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:41:06):**  have the capital to invest in them and just couldn't afford the risk.  When my cousin died, we we'd used up all available credit and didn't have any borrowing power  or any potential there.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:41:21):**  So a few years down the road, I'd say in 2006, maybe 2000, I think 2006 or seven, we, um,  uh, bought a few cows, but what we bought, we just bought old used up roping heppers  and we built our herd entirely out of the old roping heifers.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:41:43):**  And um, we bought a few cows from Joe and Nancy Moore early on, just cold cows from  their herd, which were Longhorns and roping heifers.  And then we just, we, when we'd find cheap roping heifers, we'd pick up a few, throw  
**[0:41:56-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:41:56):**  them in and they start producing ugly little calves.  It takes, it was interesting.  We just had find them and we just looked for, you know, deals on the roping heifers and  
**[0:42:08-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:42:08):**  it would take about a year for them to kind of come out of it.  They used to have a calf in that time, but they, uh, to kind of get right on being handled  and their nutrition and everything, it'd be about a year long process and then they'd  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:42:23):**  be settled in.  I'm happy after a year.  I've kind of noticed that with some of the, some of the used up bred roping heifers that  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:42:31):**  I've bought from random places that they're, they're fairly skittish creatures at first  and for quite a while.  They are, aren't they?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:42:38):**  They do not trust humans and for good reason.  Yeah.  Team ropers are some of the worst stockmen in the world, quite frankly.  
**[0:42:50-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:42:50):**  I've been asked several times.  I've been asked several times if I wanted to lease out ropers.  Um, no, but I'll sell them to you.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:00):**  I'm not really, not really interested in that, in that whole operation, to be honest  with you.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:06):**  I don't want them back after they've been to that hell.  So yeah, no, we, one of our, uh, our little philosophies here is that a rodeo is just  damn near ruined the ranching world.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:19):**  Rodeo takes everything you try to avoid on a ranch every day.  And you, if you're a good rancher, good stockman, you avoid letting your horse buck.  You avoid having to rope cattle.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:29):**  You avoid cutting cattle.  You avoid doing any of those kinds of wild, fast, exciting things.  That's not to say we don't like roping and doing some of that, but your job is to not  
**[0:43:41-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:41):**  have to do that.  If you're a good enough stockman, you rarely need to rope much.  And when you do rope, you're just catching them at a walk or a standstill.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:49):**  Um, and you're certainly not chasing them.  Um, and your, your, your horse is bucking on a regular basis.  And mine did when I was a young man because I enjoyed it and it was fun, but you're doing  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:43:59):**  it wrong.  Quit doing that.  And your horse will be a lot happier and you'll be a lot healthier.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:06):**  But um, but so yeah, rodeos pretty rough on ranching.  Maybe we should qualify that by saying like, there's, there's a difference between like  rodeo and then ranch rodeos.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:21):**  I kind of like the ranch rodeos.  That's, that's a little more of a show of practical skills, even though it's a competition  speed, which is probably a little too stressful for the animals.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:32):**  It's still a good demonstration of practical skills.  It is.  And it started that way, especially it's gotten a little more like a rodeo faster and  
**[0:44:41-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:41):**  quicker and you know, a little more violent, but it is definitely several grades better  than, than regular rodeo.  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:50):**  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:53):**  I think, you know, the key insight is anytime you stress your cattle, you're losing money.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yep, that is it.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:44:59):**  Exactly.  And not just right then you'd lose money down the road too, because they're that much harder  to handle the next time, that much more stressed when you need to do something with them.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:45:08):**  Well, and I think especially cows that transfer, transfers right to their kids and then you  have bad behaviors in their kids just right from the start.  It's, it's really interesting how that works and carries on, you know, almost like it's  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:45:22):**  genetic or something after that.  So yeah.  I'm sure there's definitely, you know, some epigenetics going on there, then, you know,  
**[0:45:30-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:45:30):**  learn behavior.  When, oh, yeah, when the mom sees you a quarter mile away and she bolts and takes her calf  with her, you know, that calf's gonna learn that.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:45:39):**  Well, when that when that green thing comes in the pasture, mom runs, so I better run  from it too.  Well, I think even in utero, Brian, I think in in utero, if I said that right, it really  
**[0:45:52-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:45:52):**  influences those genetics and then when you stress them, that gene becomes expressed,  right?  So I think I agree completely because we've had, we've handled thousands and thousands  
**[0:46:07-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:46:07):**  of yearlings and cows and it's, I, you just, it's, and you know, it's, it's an interesting  thing how you can handle wild cattle, but you just, it's how you approach them, your  body language, I mean, and it transfers right down through to your horse and we, you know,  
**[0:46:24-0:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:46:24):**  we use dogs as well, but we only use dogs as a, as a punishment.  We don't use our dogs to push or drive or, we don't push cattle anywhere.  We don't push cattle anywhere, but the dogs are just a last resort.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:46:43):**  You make them want to find a herd.  That's right.  That's what we use dogs for.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:46:48):**  As a, as a wolf that you can direct for an airstrike, a simulated predator that you can  put into place to, to generate a pressure on your herd.  That is exactly well said.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:01):**  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah.  So the title I have written down here for this episode, and I came up with this a little  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:10):**  while ago, was regenerative ranching from horseback.  How do you guys feel about that?  Yeah.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:16):**  I love it.  That's good.  We are a kind of ranch slogan right now is sustainable grass-fed beast on with unconventional  
**[0:47:26-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:26):**  ranching on protected prairie.  That's kind of what we're trying to do.  And we're, you know, we, we have conservation easements on all our property and promote  
**[0:47:38-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:38):**  conservation easements as much as possible.  That's part of that long-term planning, you know.  And but we're also very unconventional.  
**[0:47:49-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:47:49):**  We don't want to just get stuck doing the same old things and doing traditional things.  We love tradition.  We are a family motto is no history, honor tradition and grow beyond.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:48:02):**  And you know, we do, we honor tradition.  We honor our history, cowboy culture, ranching culture, but we want to take the very best  parts of that and make it better and make it something more.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:48:17):**  That's that's pretty powerful stuff, Josh.  I love it.  Yeah, no, I especially love it because I think a lot of people think if they're regenerative,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:48:26):**  they have to get rid of the cowboy culture, which I really don't think that that's true.  Absolutely.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:48:39):**  But I think if you if you really look, the older cowboy culture is so much more tuned  into that regenerative type ag.  You know, I grew up my grandfather had driven cattle from Texas to Kansas as a young man  
**[0:48:56-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:48:56):**  during World War One when the trains were shut down.  He'd loose herded cattle out in the hills as a boy.  And I grew up cowboying with him.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:49:05):**  I don't think he spoke three words to me when we were horseback in my entire life.  But I just followed him and watched everything he did.  He always sent me with his partner and friend, Toad Griffin.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:49:17):**  And Toad was a little short fat guy, he wore bib overalls and broken shoes with mismatched  OK spurs on a saddle that was held together with Seifel Tline on a fat horse.  And at first I kind of thought I was being punished for being a little kid and just having  
**[0:49:32-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:49:32):**  to go along with old Toad.  And we just kind of jog trot through the pastures and get to a spot and sit and wait.  But we were always where we needed to be.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:49:41):**  And it didn't even as a little kid, I quickly figured out that Toad was the best man out  there and knew exactly what he was doing, what he needed to do.  And we were always in the right spot without ever getting out of a walk or a trot.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:49:55):**  Often when we get to what I now call Toad Hills, which are just little high spots or  something in a pasture where you need to be when you know you're, you know, moving cattle  through there.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:04):**  He would pull out a little flask of whiskey and offer me a sip and then take a sip, put  it back in, I'd always decline politely.  And then he'd pull out a plug at the back and offer me a bite and then he'd put a bite  
**[0:50:16-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:16):**  in his lip and I'd always decline politely of course.  But it was our little ritual.  But boy did I learn a lot from those old men.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:24):**  They knew more about stockmanship and cattle and horses than anybody does today.  And I also have been working for a bunch of old timers back in the late 80s and early  90s.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:38):**  I worked for old timers all over the place.  And a lot of them knew more, you know, they'd grown up without any equipment.  They didn't have feed trucks.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:46):**  They didn't have good pins.  They didn't have squeeze chutes.  And they could do everything that needed doing, you know, with a horse and a little bit of  
**[0:50:56-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:50:56):**  barbed wire or something, you know, just using stockmanship to get done what we use equipment  and metal to do today.  And it is, you know, when we saddle up about every morning and go out and we're moving  
**[0:51:12-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:51:12):**  cattle or checking cattle and it is, like I said, just a pleasure.  You interact with your horses, the cattle and you see everything and you're constantly  analyzing and it's just, it's a joy.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:51:29):**  There really is.  Yeah.  Our goal is to eventually do 90% of what we need to do on the ranch without turning a  
**[0:51:37-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:51:37):**  key or starting a motor.  And we aren't quite there yet, but I think by in a year or two, we'll be there where  90% of the time we just walk out, saddle a horse and ride off and do what we need to  
**[0:51:49-0:51:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:51:49):**  do.  I think that'd be a pretty good place to be.  I mean, the, the lower, you know, the tractor starts, the side by side starts, the gasoline  
**[0:51:59-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:51:59):**  bill, the pickup bill, you know, the smaller we make those, as long as we're not losing  ground by, you know, horses and tack and horse feed and depreciation, you know, I think that's  definitely something that a lot of people ought to be looking at.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:18):**  So we have also been carrying out fence on our pastures and that makes it more enjoyable  for the cattle and for us riding through them.  And see tearing out fence, that's like, you know, it doesn't weird me out, but a lot of,  
**[0:52:33-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:33):**  you know, really hardcore regenerative people would be like, you're tearing out fence and  it's making things better.  I can feel them turning now.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:40):**  Yup.  How does that work?  It makes a lot of people cringe.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:44):**  It almost feels like they lose control, right?  To me that's what I felt.  I was like, oh, how do you, you're losing control?  
**[0:52:50-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:50):**  But I, you know, I kind of, from what we've talked about already, kind of understand the  purpose now.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:52:57):**  There, there was a noted behavioral change in our cattle last year and we tore the fence  out last, I guess a couple years ago and they behave completely different now that they  have, you know, a bigger area and they just behave differently.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:53:15):**  And do let me say this, we've torn the fence out on our big north pasture and our south  pasture, just making two great big kind of landscape scale pastures that have two or  three mile grazing paths that we can send cattle on.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:53:31):**  We did that mainly because we were finding in our smaller pastures, we got a ping pong  effect where if we were using IMG and we send cattle on a grazing path, if they hit a fence,  they just kind of bounce off and turn direction and you had a lot more trouble controlling  
**[0:53:46-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:53:46):**  where they wanted, where they were going to go for long term anyway.  And so by, by taking those out and letting them behave more like, you know, a migratory  herd, it really helped us.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:53:59):**  It also really took care of some water problems because, you know, we were often overgrazing  certain pastures because that's where we had good water.  So if we were droughty, we'd have to be there more because just the quality of water.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:54:16):**  But this way we can take them to water and then, you know, send them on a path away from  it and what is a lot better utilization of grass and we, you know, all those fence lines,  if you looked on places, those fence lines, if they're permanent fences, have horrible  
**[0:54:30-0:54:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:54:30):**  scarring and damage along them and brush and, you know, everything that fence line brings.  And by getting rid of those, that just kind of evaporates and it becomes a more, a less  fractured prairie.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:54:42):**  Are you even noticing less of that trailing and erosion on your perimeter fences?  Yeah, because they don't hang on the perimeter nearly as much.  They have so much more space.  
**[0:54:52-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:54:52):**  They just, they just, why would they want to hang out there?  They can, you know, go other places.  So yeah, we're, we're healing a lot of scars that are, have been there for, you know, decades  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:55:03):**  and decades, but, and it'll take a while.  Everything's long, the long game here.  We, we aren't playing the short con.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:55:09):**  We are playing for long term results and so we're not expecting to change things this  year or next.  We're expecting things to be better in a decade and even better in the decades to come.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:55:23):**  That's what our goals are.  Well, and part of, part of our grazing philosophy also is, like Josh said, the nature plus,  you know, one or two things, one or two other things, but also chaos.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:55:38):**  Chaos is very, I guess, important in the scheme of things because nothing in nature is very  systematic and there's lots of chaos.  And so we just, you know, we'll, and we allow for a lot of rest in a lot of our pastures  
**[0:55:54-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:55:54):**  that we rest them at different times of the year, different years.  And that chaos really helps, I think, in healing the landscape and everything.  So, yeah.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:06):**  I think it's kind of worth noting that, you know, what you guys are doing is not just  turning your cows out and letting them graze how they want.  Like a lot of people do.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:18):**  And that's, I think that's a misconception that people have is that our cows, our cows  for the most part have forgot how to be cows and they need to be retaught.  Exactly.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:32):**  Yeah.  We, we call those kinds of cows chemical cows, Brian, because they, they require a lot of  chemicals to just exist.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:41):**  Our cows don't require any.  Yeah.  I really liked the ones I bought from you.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:46):**  Well, good, good.  We're glad you got them.  We, we sold our cow herd down.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:56:53):**  We lost some grass here this winter.  And so we sold some of our herd and we kept just the very best of our cows.  And a lot of sisters, the ones you have, I think.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:57:04):**  But it's just awfully fun to be out there and see cows that we've been developing for  over a decade, decade and a half and see them.  Oh, we were, we have them turned out on a pasture for calving right now that's right  
**[0:57:21-0:57:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:57:21):**  along our driveway to our house and it's on the river bottom and it's old farm ground  that you know, we went back in 98 and it's not the best stuff.  It's pretty low quality grass.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:57:33):**  There's a lot of wood, there's not, you know, a lot of diversity in species, but we were  just literally driving back to the house from the mailbox and saw a mother and her adult  daughter take turns eating a Virginia creeper, which nothing wants to eat a Virginia creeper.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:57:53):**  It's thorny and bitter and nasty.  And they were going through, the mother was eating very tip leaves and then the daughter,  one of her adult daughters was coming through and eating the second and third leaf behind  
**[0:58:03-0:58:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:03):**  her.  But you know, it's just kind of fun to see cows that are learning to, that have learned  to go back to being, browsing out arboreal animals.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:13):**  I've seen them eating all kinds of stuff, willow trees, I'll name it.  If it's in the pasture, they'll try it.  And I think that's really good.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:22):**  Absolutely.  Yeah, I've seen this creeper, yes I've planned, I thought that was the coolest thing ever.  Yep, isn't that fun?  
**[0:58:29-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:29):**  I just love watching cows eat.  And then they've, you know, they've got those big old spears on each side of their head  and they walk through all the brush and trash it.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:39):**  You know, the black cows that everybody else has, they don't do that as well.  No, they'll stand there and want you to bring feed to them.  So what were you- Although we've had pretty good, I was going  
**[0:58:53-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:58:53):**  to say we've had pretty good luck taking kind of conventional cows that don't have any instincts  that are, you know, are really bred to stand there and eat corn out of a bucket.  And we're getting them, we get them to go work.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:59:08):**  They they'll go out and they'll, they are eating a lot better.  They don't just sit there and eat ice cream.  They're going around and they're trying everything.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:59:16):**  We're getting them to eat shumac and locusts and all kinds of stuff.  But it takes a while.  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:59:25):**  So you mentioned that you're trying to develop, what were you trying to develop with your  cows?  What was the direction you're trying to go?  
**[0:59:34-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:59:34):**  So we, yeah, we got, we bought them and just those, you know, old heifers and stuff.  And we just, I just bought cheap bulls, threw whatever I could find, got lucky on a few.  And just wanted to develop cattle that just required almost no input.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=0:59:55):**  Of course, being in the Flint Hills here, we have to feed protein in the winter.  You know, our protein quality goes way down.  Our forbs will provide good protein till about mid-December, usually late December sometimes.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:00:11):**  If you have enough healthy for populations like lead plants and some of those things,  lead plants over 20% protein all through the early winter.  And you don't have to feed much protein early on.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:00:24):**  But late winter, you just got to feed protein.  So that's really the only input we kind of allow our cows to need.  And we're hoping, especially with the patch burning stuff, our cool season grasses are  
**[1:00:37-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:00:37):**  coming a lot more, coming back stronger.  I think the annual burning really subdues cool season grasses.  And by not doing that, we're getting more and more cool season grasses and we feed less  
**[1:00:50-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:00:50):**  and less supplemental protein to our cows every winter, I think.  And I think, Brian, we're shooting for about a 900 to 1000 pound cow.  And just really hardy and that will eat everything and just works for us instead of us working  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:07):**  for them.  And our cows don't get a shot.  They don't get bored.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:11):**  They don't get anything.  They either survive or they don't.  And they all seem to survive pretty well.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:19):**  Most of them don't even get ear tags because they won't even fit through a chute.  We visually preg check Brian, we don't run them through a chute too often.  There's some of them that, yeah, even though I got a chute that'll take horn cattle, there's  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:38):**  some of them that just aren't, they're just going to live forever.  They can just exist.  A lot of our cows have just never been in a chute.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:46):**  They just never have.  They never spend any time in that.  Well, and you just brought up a good point.  
**[1:01:51-1:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:01:51):**  So a lot of these cows also have longevity.  And so, you know, they'll give us 10 or 12 calves in quality, like quality calves till  the very end there instead of two or three.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:06):**  And just, yeah, their reproductive value is really high.  Yeah.  They're very fertile and long-lived.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:16):**  They are, you don't have to worry about that.  Yeah, yeah.  So raising for profit, we talk about managing your cows depreciation and it sounds like,  
**[1:02:25-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:25):**  sorry Brian, it sounds like you guys have it.  You figure it out how to manage that cows depreciation.  And can we just talk about that for people who haven't done RFP?  
**[1:02:36-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:36):**  Because I think for one island about that, it was for me, it was like a paradigm shift  changer.  I was like, wow, why didn't I buy my car like that?  
**[1:02:46-1:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:46):**  Why don't I buy cows like that?  And I'll say I have to give full credit to Dan Parsons on that because he sat down with  me.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:02:56):**  He knew I hadn't started ranching.  I was just getting ready to.  And he sat down with me and talked about that and just went through the depreciation of  
**[1:03:04-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:04):**  a cow and you know what that would mean and all.  And I did not buy cows for a long time until I could figure out a way to do it without  having to worry about the depreciation.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:13):**  What I did, I just went out and bought cows that were already at salvage price.  And I was buying three, $400 cows and getting multiple calves out of them before I had to  sell them again for three or $400.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:29):**  And that just eliminates that problem.  The calves are worth less, but then again, they take less feed and less land to stand  on too.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:37):**  Right.  So we can obviously run more cows on the acreage we have.  A lot more beef per acre.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:42):**  That's what it's all about.  With less input.  I figured that a guy could run almost five 800 pound Corriente types for every three  
**[1:03:54-1:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:54):**  big Angus cows.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  Agreed.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:03:59):**  And we've been doing that without spell grazing for 20 years now.  We've been able to increase our stocking capacity for, or carrying capacity greatly just by  the management intensive grazing, I guess.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:04:21):**  And thoughtful grazing, I guess.  I don't know quite how to describe it, but just using every tool we can to influence  how they graze, where they graze.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:04:30):**  And boy, have we increased our carrying capacity.  We can run a lot more pounds per acre.  I would say thoughtful grazing and chaos.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:04:37):**  Yeah, there you go.  As nature is chaos to a large degree.  It is chaos.  
**[1:04:46-1:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:04:46):**  And one thing I've noticed here, we've been doing a project where we're planting the farm  ground on Des Moines Creek property back to native grass and all the conservationists,  everybody involved in that is always wanting to categorize things and contain things and  
**[1:05:03-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:03):**  control things and put timelines on things.  And that's just not a good way to do that.  That's farming.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:09):**  That's not working with nature.  That's not how nature works.  You know, you don't kill things to grow things.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:15):**  You grow more things and encourage the right things to grow.  And that's our, you know.  Fertility drives the bus.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:24):**  Absolutely.  So part of the enjoyment, and we do enjoy ranching a lot, and part of it is we just  don't fight nature.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:35):**  We just try to coincide.  Yeah, or time and we just try to help it out or fit into what is being offered to us too.  And that was hard for me early on to kind of let go of timelines.  
**[1:05:50-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:05:50):**  I wanted to achieve things by a certain time and all.  And I think maybe when you're younger, you do that more.  But as I matured and grew up a little bit, I realized that if you quit putting timelines  
**[1:06:02-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:06:02):**  on things and just have the outcome that you're in, outcome in mind, you get there often faster  than if you're trying to force it.  So that was quite a paradigm.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:06:13):**  There you go.  And that goes for stockmanship too.  Oh yeah, stockmanship definitely.

**[1:06:26-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:06:26):**  What is the best advice you wish you had the first day you came to the ranch?  I'm sorry, Brian, say it one more time.  What is the best advice that you wish you had the first day you started ranching?  
**[1:06:47-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:06:47):**  I think, you know, I grew up in, like I said, on a row crop farm and we had, like I said,  we had a few cattle and we had pigs and everything, but I was very traditional and very steep  in kind of, you know, fighting against stuff and working against nature.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:07:08):**  And so I, maybe some of the, one of the best advice or best advice that I could have gotten  would have been to kind of relax and just kind of, you know, work with nature and enjoy  it.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:07:26):**  And really, you know, the influence that I have on it, make it pretty minimal, kind of  stay out of its way.  And I maybe just enjoy it more.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:07:36):**  That it's so important to enjoy the things you do.  I got a pretty good piece of advice fairly early on.  It's from a gentleman that worked on a neighboring ranch and he always liked to say, if something  
**[1:07:52-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:07:52):**  bothers you on your ranch that much, just quit going over there and looking at it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:08:00):**  And then I, when, oh go ahead.  No, you're fine.  Well, I was going to say, I think we often spend a lot of time worrying about the things  
**[1:08:15-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:08:15):**  we shouldn't and we don't spend enough time thinking about the things we should.  So that's, that would be, I guess a mindset that would have been nice to have, you know,  had someone kind of help you, help, help me develop when I was younger too, that would  
**[1:08:33-1:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:08:33):**  have been better.  I'm pretty sure I told her that a few times, Brian, she just didn't listen.  Well, you can't see it, but I just slapped him.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:08:49):**  I think it's the other way.  I think he just didn't listen.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:08:53-1:09:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:08:53):**  And I have to say, finding someone to do this with is just the best, so yeah.  So what would be y'all's one tip to make the world a better place?  Oh boy.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:09:13):**  Josie, you take this one.  Let's hear from Josie.  We haven't heard from her yet.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:09:29):**  Maybe to slow down and start taking time to enjoy things and get good at things that you  love to do, like running our cattle and stockmanship.  Those are things I just love to do and I love taking time all day, every day to do it and  
**[1:09:46-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:09:46):**  get better at it and learn new things about it.  Awesome.  Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, Josie?  
**[1:09:53-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:09:53):**  How old are you and what are you up to these days?  I'm 17 and I currently just help my parents on the ranch right now with everything.  So 17, you're thinking about college later?  
**[1:10:09-1:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:09):**  Not college.  If anything, I do trade school.  I definitely want to do ranching for profit school and work for conservationists in different  
**[1:10:18-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:18):**  ranches, possibly dairies and feedlots.  I want to experience all aspects of agriculture if I can.  I think that's a very smart thing for a young person to be able to have the freedom to get  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:31):**  out and be able to look at a bunch of different operations before you kind of decide what  you want to do.  I like it.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:37):**  Yes.  Awesome.  So what's something that motivates you to get out of bed right now, Josie?  
**[1:10:49-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:49):**  I'm not really a morning person.  I said coffee, Brian.  But I guess getting to ride my horses.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:10:59):**  That would be my biggest motivation.  I love it.  Ride your horses, be out in nature with cows.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:11:07):**  One of my favorite things to do in the morning if I don't have to go to a pasture rotation,  just go be with my cows while I have my morning coffee and let the world wake up.  Awesome.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:11:19):**  Now, Josie's going to be taking coffee on her horse.  You mean you guys don't have saddles with cup holders?  We're going to now.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:11:32):**  That's a good idea.  I'll try to have one rigged up for this weekend for you, Brian.  Perfect.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:11:44):**  Perfect.  Make sure it's leak proof.  So where can we find you guys on social media?  
**[1:11:49-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:11:49):**  Do you have a website or a good social media presence you want to talk about for a little  bit?  We intentionally shut down our website and most of our social media after we shut the  
**[1:12:00-1:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:12:00):**  gas ranch down because we're just inundated with contact constantly for a while.  Now that that's upside down, our Flat Hills Flying W is our website.  It's not active right now, but we're getting ready to kind of reopen that and start promoting  
**[1:12:16-1:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:12:16):**  some of our conservation, education and direct marketing of beef.  And Facebook, we're on there, Flying W Ranch.  And Flying W Ranch, grass fed beef.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:12:28):**  Yeah, and we just we were Audubon certified or I guess for bird friendly beef.  We're in their program.  And yeah, we're just getting ready to start promoting some beef direct consumers.  
**[1:12:49-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:12:49):**  We're doing like whole cow burger or whole wok burger and bone broth and then grass fed  bird friendly dog chews and like rawhide chews and bones from the bone broth production too.  That's great.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:13:04):**  I'm looking forward to seeing some of those products.  Yeah, we love, Josie and I always, when we were running the dude ranch, we always, you  know, butchered our own animals and fed everybody our own beef, of course.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:13:19):**  And we made bone broth, oh gosh, usually 50, 60 gallons of bone broth every fall to use  the next year.  And so we've always made a lot of bone broth.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:13:32):**  It's the great thing to cook with.  There's also kind of a trendy thing.  A lot of people like bone broth, especially grass fed bird friendly bone broth.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:13:39):**  And so we're going to produce that and use some of the farmers market type rules to market  that.  And we have a lot of dogs, cast our dog cheese off.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:13:52):**  I like drinking bone broth, a good beef bone broth.  It's a soup with all the crap in it.  It's everything.  
**[1:14:00-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:00):**  A lot of things I like about soup with a lot of the, without a bunch of stuff that I don't.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:07):**  It's a good concentrated source of bioavailable nutrients.  Oh, absolutely.  Anytime I'm feeling like I need energy or I'm not feeling well, I go to bone broth.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:21):**  Well, I'll have to get some to you guys.  Well, and I was trying to think years ago, how many years ago was it on the grass fed?  Tallgrass.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:32):**  Yeah.  It was in, I think 92 is when we first started tallgrass beef co-op.  So Josh was in on a tallgrass beef co-op where they did grass fed beef back in 1992.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:49):**  And yeah, he was on the, what do they call it?  The bleeding edge instead of the cutting edge.  Yeah.  
**[1:14:55-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:14:55):**  We were a little early in our adapting back.  And that was a good learning experience.  It was a really good learning experience.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:15:02):**  And you know, we've had, we've done beef sales just ever since.  But yeah, that was quite a learning experience, especially on distribution and slaughter and  everything else.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:15:16):**  So we've had quite a lesson on that.  And so this is why we're kind of going this different route with a few kind of niche items  and stuff like that.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:15:27):**  That was some of the really good takeaways from a few of my conversations with Mike Calacrate  is don't even think about the wholesale market.  Don't even try to be in restaurants.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:15:38):**  You want to be all direct consumer and find some of those value add niches like pet food  or pet products that you can really push.  You know, we had this and I guess I married Josh when it was still going and we had this  
**[1:15:54-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:15:54):**  just wonderful product.  But getting it, I mean, it was just a nightmare.  Trying to get big enough to get, you know, the economy of scale and get to the right  
**[1:16:07-1:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:07):**  grocery stores and all that.  We just couldn't do it.  We couldn't grow fast enough to do it.  
**[1:16:13-1:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:13):**  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, it was such a good idea and it is still such a good idea, but economically it was  really tough.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:20):**  So yeah.  I think that's, I mean, it's also a common thing with theme with a lot of folks that  we've talked to in the last few months is almost everybody in the business is looking  
**[1:16:34-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:34):**  at alternative marketing channels and looking at trying to do a lot more direct consumer  sales not only because of COVID but also because the consumers are starting to demand it.  And now through social media, you know, we're able to connect with people so much better.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:51):**  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And we have a big network of people that we've connected with over the last 20 years with  
**[1:16:58-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:16:58):**  the guest ranch business that, you know, we can pull from and we intend to keep doing  that we're going to have seed collection days and bird surveys and herpetological surveys,  stuff like that, where we get, you know, groups of interested people to come out and participate  
**[1:17:16-1:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:17:16):**  in things on the ranch.  And then those are all potential customers that have a connection to the place that their  beef can come from.  
**[1:17:23-1:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:17:23):**  Yeah.  Above and beyond just getting on a horse and going out and being able to ride the Flint  Hills, it's actually taking part and looking at some of these intricacies of the buyer  
**[1:17:36-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:17:36):**  biology of the prairie, you know, how the frogs and the birds and the insects and how  the different plants coexist with each other and exist to create a healthy prairie.  Absolutely.  
**[1:17:50-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:17:50):**  Yeah.  And, you know, one of the things, you know, this biome that we live in is so endangered  and people really, it doesn't seem that way when you're here.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:18:03):**  But, you know, promoting the conservation of and why that's so important and getting  that message out to people is a high priority for us as well.  There's no doubt that the grassland biome, the High Plains grassland biome is the most  
**[1:18:21-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:18:21):**  threatened habitat and it's converting at just an astonishing rate to closed canopy  eastern red cedar forest.  I mean, you guys see it there around Flint Hills, CK, I know you see it Manhattan.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:18:34):**  I've watched those infernal green things march west my entire life.  Yeah.  And my dad told them the green glacier.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:18:45):**  Yeah, the green glacier.  Yeah.  Yes, absolutely.  
**[1:18:51-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:18:51):**  Green glacier is, is it's accurate because it's, it's so slow.  You almost can't see it, but it is, it's near unstoppable.  Yeah, it's relentless.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:19:03):**  Well, and if you, you know, if you kind of, it's interesting now, you look at your areas  that have trees and I look at them now as seed bases.  That's what I look at them as.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:19:17):**  And not just a tree line, but it's just, it's an area where just other trees grow out.  And so, yeah, and they take a lot of water and all kinds of resources and stuff like  that.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:19:31):**  So, you know, I guess kind of a shift on how you view them, you know, and view that part  of the environment.  I think that just like, you know, we talked about leaving some thatch and leaving some  
**[1:19:45-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:19:45):**  stockpile as drought insurance, getting rid of the cedar trees, I think is pretty cheap  drought insurance too, and not only that, you get rid of those trees and your forage  production comes back.  
**[1:19:56-1:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:19:56):**  Yeah.  How much water does one cedar tree take?  Is it 80, 50 gallons?  
**[1:20:04-1:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:04):**  I think you're right.  Yeah, I think it's 50 or 60.  A lot.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:08):**  Yeah.  What I've read was an eight inch diameter tree at four feet off the ground is going  to drink 30 to 35 gallons of water a day.  
**[1:20:20-1:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:20):**  Now, I've cut a lot of cedar trees and you can have a hundred year old tree that's four  inches at four feet, but four feet at ground level and you can have a tree that's only  20 years old that's, you know, an eight inch pole that's 30 feet tall.  
**[1:20:35-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:35):**  Just it all depends on where they grow.  I think the moral of the story is, like, by the time you see one that's 10 feet tall,  it's probably drinking 30 gallons of water a day.  
**[1:20:45-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:45):**  And that's just a scene.  Yeah, that is.  And it's amazing how we've done some, you know, tree removal and stuff.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:20:57):**  And I literally in one valley I was cleaning up.  It was a dry, dry winter.  And I cut just a bunch of cedar trees out of an area.  
**[1:21:07-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:07):**  And it was just a little bit foggy or had been in the summer.  You could tell where it's been more boggy.  It was dry then.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:14):**  And I went back the next day to finish pushing them up and keep on going.  And it was wet.  There was standing water there.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:22):**  And I'm like, that is just from cutting down trees.  It just, you know, eliminates that much draw on it.  Have you been back there lately?  
**[1:21:31-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:31):**  What's it doing now?  Oh, yeah, it stays wet year round now.  Yeah, there's actually a small spring that always has water.  
**[1:21:41-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:41):**  And I've seen that.  I can't count how many times I've seen something very similar where either I've been in mechanically  and cleared out a canyon or fires done it for me.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:21:54):**  Almost every canyon now that's got the trees are gone from, I've got a spring in and it's  just crazy how much water there is when you get rid of these trees.  And you know, you read my dad's a historian and folklorist and he has a lot of journals  
**[1:22:10-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:10):**  from early settlers and stuff out here and cowboys, trail cowboys and stuff traveling  through this part of the country.  And their description of the water is just amazing.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:24):**  He has, I get what it's in, but it's an account of some fur trap, French fur trappers that  came through here.  And you know, the beaver had water.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:33):**  There were huge beaver ponds here.  There were more beaver here than there were anywhere else on the plane, you know, here  on the plane.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:40):**  Yeah, with moose and everything else here.  And the amount of water that they, that those beaver held and the amount of springs back  then was just amazing.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:50):**  And we can have that back if we just go back to grassland and get rid of these invasive  species of trees.  Right, right.  
**[1:22:59-1:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:22:59):**  And we have, we have a few beaver populations that they kind of migrate around, but they  have built, they're amazing.  They've built some dams on us in certain areas of the pasture and that it still holds water.  
**[1:23:12-1:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:12):**  Yeah, they're the most valuable animals on the place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:18-1:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:18):**  So I'm from California, so drought is very familiar to us, but we call it manly drought.  So it almost feels like, you know, Brian, he made the comment 30 days from drought,  but you know, obviously you guys have more rainfall than someone like me in California.  
**[1:23:32-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:32):**  We get 11 inches a year.  But it is almost manly drought as well, right?  Yeah.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:39):**  The cedar trees.  Oh, yeah.  It is.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:42):**  Yeah, just by quitting burning and changing grazing practices.  Resources.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:23:50-1:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:23:50):**  Yeah, like this.  Definitely man made.  And I think that that's probably not a terrible place to start wrapping this up.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:24:03):**  So Hoy family, is there anything that you guys would like to ask me or ask CK?  You'll probably get all the questions in the world, Saturday, Sunday night.  I tell you what, Brian, I'm pretty excited to ride with you.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:24:21):**  I think it'll be fun.  I'm excited to learn from you, Gwen.  Learn from the master.  
**[1:24:28-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:24:28):**  We will do that.  We will do that.  All the evidence, good and bad.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:24:41):**  I was asked to take my drone.  So that's as soon as we get done here.  That's the next project is get the drone ready to travel.  
**[1:24:49-1:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:24:49):**  So I will, I will have my drone and charged batteries to record all the silliness.  I get well, will you guys, is this, will you have any other questions for us or will this  be nevermind?  
**[1:25:05-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:25:05):**  Maybe I'll remember that at that out.  Go ahead.  When was the, can you remember the last time you were on a horse?  
**[1:25:22-1:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:25:22):**  Not clearly.  I think I stayed on for at least eight seconds last time.  It's been a while.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:25:39):**  It has been, it has been a very long time.  We've been, Alexander Ranch has been pretty much a entirely mechanized operation since  dad went to ranching for profit in the late nineties.  
**[1:25:50-1:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:25:50):**  And he kind of had the paradigm shattered that he would never run that ranch on a horse.  So that's, that's why he went down the path of mechanization and, and intense cross fencing.  Maybe my mind will be, maybe my paradigm will be shattered in a few days.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/14--Hoy-Family-Regenerative-Ranching-From-Horseback-e119rot#t=1:26:07):**  We'll see.  Well guys, it has been a ton of fun.  Thank you for joining us today.

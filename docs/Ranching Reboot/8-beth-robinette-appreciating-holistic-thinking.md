Today's guest, this really ties up a lot of the concepts we discussed in previous episodes  with Mike Calacrate and Temple Granin about supply chains and about food hubs.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:01:01):**  You know, I've understood that a lot of you haven't listened to everything.  That there wasn't episode zero.  So I'd encourage you after you listen to this one, go back and check out episode zero.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:01:12):**  It does explain a little bit about who we are and what we're doing here.  And coming up, I've got a special treat.  I don't know if we're going to be able to get it out this week or it'll be next week,

A lot of you have been having questions about who is this CK person anyway.  We're going to answer those questions in an hour and a half special coming up.

**[0:01:41-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:01:41):**  What it means to be a second generation holistic rancher and about novel marketing channels  and public food spaces.  We talk about solving distribution issues, separating producers from consumers.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:01:53):**  So as always, here's my co-pilot and my best buddy CK to introduce today's guest.  All right.  Hi everyone.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:04):**  This is Ranching Reboot with Red Hills Rancher and CK.  Today we have Beth Robinette at Lacy R Ranch.  Beth, how are you doing?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:12):**  I'm great.  Happy to be here.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:15):**  So Beth, welcome.  It's great to have you here.  It's been quite a while since we've seen each other.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:22):**  I know I've been following you on Instagram for a while and I'm definitely a fan.  There's a lot we want to talk about.  So well, first, for those that aren't familiar with you, why don't you go ahead and give  
**[0:02:33-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:33):**  us a rundown of where you're at and where you're at, where you've been and how you got  where you are and what your operation's like.  Sure.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:42):**  Yeah.  So I'm based in Spokane, Washington, just west of Spokane, which is part of the historic  tribal homeland of the Spokane people.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:02:54):**  But Spokane is kind of an interesting, I don't know how much history you want me to go into,  but I'm just going to go way back.  Spokane is really kind of an interesting place because the Spokane Falls, which is really  
**[0:03:05-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:03:05):**  like what the city of Spokane is built around, is an ancient gathering place for the Spokane  people, for salmon fishing and just kind of like an important cultural hub and gathering  place.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:03:17):**  And that's really what the city of Spokane is built around.  And so that also means that this area was a trade route where people moved, people from  lots of different tribes were interacting and coming together.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:03:33):**  And we also, you know, fast forward through a few hundred years of history, kind of because  we're in the Pacific Northwest at the very end of westward expansion for the United States,  at which point the United States military was kind of in an effort mood and was just  
**[0:03:52-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:03:52):**  like, yep, let's just get rid of all of these Indians.  And really not a lot of like negotiation happening around that.  And so in the series of just like a few years, really the Spokane people were really restricted  
**[0:04:12-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:04:12):**  in terms of their access to the traditional land base.  And then fast forward through history a bit more to my family arriving on the scene.  My great grandparents came to the Lazy R ranch in 1937.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:04:28):**  So prior to that, they were kind of doing dirt farming, tenant farming around the Palouse,  which is kind of the wheat growing region just to the south of us.  And they knew that they wanted to establish close to Spokane during the Great Depression.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:04:45):**  They had a few milk cows, I think they had 20 cows or something.  And they knew if they could find some farmland close to an urban center, that they would  have enough of a market to be able to kind of weather the depression.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:04:58):**  This is probably a way longer answer than you anticipated.  But you asked me how I got here.  So here we are.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:05:08):**  So my great grandpa and my grandpa and my great uncle kind of ran the dairy together.  My grandma, we've always had an off farm, off ranch income as part of our family.  My great grandma was actually a professional chef.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:05:26):**  So she worked at Lakeland Village, which is this nearby institution for developmentally  disabled people.  And she ran the kitchen there and was serving like many hundreds of meals of scratch cooking.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:05:43):**  They also had a farm there that kind of the clients that live there, or the people who  are institutionalized there ran the farm as well.  So anyway, now that I'm engaged in a lot of farm to table work, I just find these patterns  
**[0:05:58-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:05:58):**  through history really, really fascinating.  What I'm trying to get institutions to do, or what I've spent a lot of my time trying  to get institutions to do now is really the same stuff that my great grandma was doing  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:06:08):**  80, 75 years ago.  All right, so fast forward through time.  We got to circle back to that later.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:06:16):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's definitely part of my, I mean, it's still related to ranching, but it's a little  different part of my life to doing it broader food systems work.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:06:28):**  So we ran the ranch as a dairy up until the 60s.  And kind of that time, well, really around 1950, my grandpa made the transition to beef  cattle.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:06:42):**  I had my great uncle kept milking cows for a little while after that, but obviously a  lot, there's been so much consolidation in the dairy industry, which I hope you do a  whole podcast about at some point.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:06:54):**  We'll have to find somebody in the dairy industry that's good to talk to.  I just think about the fact that my family was making a living on a 40 cow dairy and  how completely, you have to have a 4,000 cow dairy to live on.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:07:10):**  It's a mega dairy.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the late 50s, early 60s, that was the transition point when transportation  
**[0:07:19-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:07:19):**  and grain both became cheap enough to be able to justify confining animals and then feeding  and hauling and feeding them a bunch of grain.  And that's when the whole, I mean, that's when the whole model started to change just  
**[0:07:34-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:07:34):**  back there in the late 50s, early 60s.  When your family was getting out of the dairy and towards the beef, I'm sure that maybe  your family saw that coming.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:07:44):**  Maybe they just lucky.  But you know, that was also when the feedlot started getting built.  That my grandpa grew up milking 40 cows by hand and he was just done milking cows.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:07:57):**  Crazy.  He says mild.  He was like, let's just get, like beef is a way easier way to make a buck.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:04):**  Right.  Right.  So there might have been a bit of that, you know.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:09):**  I can understand that.  Wow.  I have I have so much respect for the dairymen because they are the hardest working guys  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:17):**  in ag.  For sure.  For sure.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:20):**  I am.  I'm definitely very lazy on the continuum of that, of cowmen.  So then the ranch was kind of run as a very conventional cow calf operation.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:33):**  My dad kind of joined on the management in the early 80s when he and my mom moved back  to the ranch and my dad and grandpa ran it together.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:44-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:08:44):**  Just pretty much doing a cow calf operation as conventional as conventional can be.  And then in the mid 90s, my my dad got accepted into this program through Washington State  University that was funded by the Kellogg Foundation, which was to train.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:05):**  I don't remember.  I think it was like a couple hundred people in Washington state in holistic management  and kind of by a fluke.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:13):**  My dad ended up in this program.  He actually wasn't slated to go.  Our neighbor was going to go to it.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:18):**  And at the last minute, like he had a schedule conflict and couldn't make it and was like,  hey, you should sign up for this program.  Take my spot.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah, I think you'll be interested in it.  And it was really pretty life changing for my dad.  And he became, you know, it was also a time that he was thinking about kind of getting  
**[0:09:35-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:35):**  out of the cattle business himself.  Mid 90s was not a not a great time to be selling beef on the commodity market.  And I think it was just my dad has a degree in sociology.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:09:51):**  He could go do something else besides chase cows around everyone in my family's right  over it.  We're all just kind of obsessed with going to school forever, I guess.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:02):**  So anyway, he he was kind of ready to get out and then had this experience where he  just got completely reinvigorated about managing cows and what the possibilities of changing  the way that we were managing our livestock could could really have an impact on on the  
**[0:10:19-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:19):**  ground.  And so he went down that rabbit hole.  So I, I at that time was like nine or 1011 years old, as my dad was kind of going through  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:28):**  this transition.  So you didn't have a choice.  He took you with him down.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah, yeah.  And it was not.  It's been really interesting for me because I'm kind of like a second generation holistic  
**[0:10:40-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:40):**  management practitioner and that like, I didn't have some life changing event that like, this  other way of approaching land management, it was like, Oh, this is just kind of the  way that we do things.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:10:56):**  And like, you think about things in a holistic way.  And you think about quality of life and future resource base and how to make sure all of  your management decisions kind of have this triple bottom line, like, how do we make sure  
**[0:11:09-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:11:09):**  everything we're doing takes into account, you ecological, social and financial factors,  like that was very much part of my mindset.  That said, I was not interested in ranching at all.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:11:24):**  Throughout my childhood, like, I was fairly oblivious of the whole thing other than knowing  that I had a really cool place in the woods to go run around.  So I had kind of like a nice quasi feral childhood, but I'm not fair.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:11:39):**  I love it.  I did not I was not hanging out with like the FFA kids at my high school.  I did not see myself doing that I was in the drama club.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:11:49):**  You know, being angsty and writing slam poetry.  But when I moved away to college, I took this class I went to I went to Fairhaven College  at Western Washington University, which is a kind of a hippie dippie design your own  
**[0:12:06-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:12:06):**  degree program.  And the first class that I took there was a 15 credit class on food, and it was taught  by three professors.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:12:18):**  And it was sort of like looking at food through an ecological lens, a social lens, and then  the third class was called critical and reflective inquiry.  So it was just kind of through a broader critical thinking lens and just like that immersive  
**[0:12:34-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:12:34):**  class combined with living off the ranch in an urban environment for the first time in  my life, and eating in a cafeteria, which was very different from the kind of food that  I write, eating eye opening, right?  
**[0:12:49-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:12:49):**  Yeah, I was just like, Oh, dang, it's actually really awesome back at home.  And I actually have had this incredibly privileged life where I've had like, access to all of  this awesome stuff.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:13:02):**  And like, I should really do something good with that.  And that was the pivot point where I started thinking about coming home and running the  ranch.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:13:11):**  And so I moved home in 2010, right after I finished up school.  You don't want to care people right now through COVID.  That that are where you were, when you started college, and you took that, that food course,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:13:29):**  but without the background and holistic management, or, you know, the background and thinking  and systems.  I think a lot of people are there.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:13:37):**  And you know, they're looking into their food systems and thinking about, you know, the  environmental and the social impact of their food systems, and they're really starting  to question it, and they're and they're looking at it, and they don't, they don't know, always  
**[0:13:52-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:13:52):**  how to ask the right questions, or where to go to find the right answers.  Does that make any sense?  Or?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:14:01):**  Yeah, no, that's interesting.  That's just that's really kind of making me think.  Yeah, you know, I, I do feel like that that like, holistic thinking approach, even though  
**[0:14:13-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:14:13):**  it was very, I'm kind of under the surface in a lot of ways, I do feel like that's been  so foundational to like, my, my worldview.  So we haven't really talked much about holistic management yet on the podcast, we've touched  
**[0:14:31-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:14:31):**  on it a few times.  Can you maybe, like encapsulate holistic management in just a few seconds in just a few minutes?  Like what is whole?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:14:39):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So so holistic management is this kind of body of work that's attributed to Alan Savory,  
**[0:14:49-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:14:49):**  who I think is a complicated person, who has like some controversial reputation, I guess.  And some of that's definitely deserved.  So he's an interesting figure.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:15:04):**  And like, I'm, but that said, like, for like, all human beings are flawed.  Definitely he is a very brilliant person.  And a lot of his work has been super influential on my life.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:15:18):**  So the core of holistic management is really that it is a values based, mission based approach  to decision making.  That's that's how I would really describe it.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:15:31):**  I think what gets a lot of attention is the grazing planning technique and strategy, which  is definitely a big part of it, if you're using holistic management as a framework to  manage land and and livestock.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:15:47):**  But what I would say is like the like secret sauce that really often gets left out of the  discussion is that you as the manager, think about what hole you're managing, like recognizing  that that hole is endlessly internet connected with all things in an ecosystem.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:08):**  The hole in your management.  Yeah, the hole in your management.  Exactly.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:16):**  And you think about where you want to move that hole in the future, what you're managing  towards.  And you have like a clear like as a group of decision makers, you have a clear, shared  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:30):**  vision of what that is.  This is okay, I'm going to take a little aside here.  Part of the interesting thing about my dad's training in holistic management is that it  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:38):**  wasn't just training in holistic management.  It was this program designed by Don Nelson, who worked at Washington State University  Extension.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:44):**  He was a cross way couple years ago, really, really tremendous man.  So he wanted to take producers and teach them holistic management, but also teach them consensus  building skills, and kind of how to do stakeholder engagement.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:16:59):**  And that project also included members of the Confederated Colville tribes and was just  this really kind of diverse cross disciplinary training that was like, how do we help managers  break out of, I mean, it's really the kind of the same stuff that your podcast is trying  
**[0:17:18-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:17:18):**  to address, I think it's like, how do we help people break out of this current like state  of where we are, which I think we can all recognize is not working super great.  How do we give them the tools to like move to the next stage of development and what  
**[0:17:34-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:17:34):**  our land management looks like?  Anyway, so I think also a lot of my understanding of holistic management is influenced by the  kind of that consensus building and some of the other stuff that isn't directly part of,  
**[0:17:51-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:17:51):**  or maybe isn't explicitly part of Alan's work.  Okay, but back to holistic management, sorry, we only have 90 minutes to get through all  of this.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:01):**  I better, I've got to, we will, if we run out of time, we'll just have you back on Beth.  We can always have you back for part two if we can get this scheduled.  I'm just finishing coffee.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:14):**  I'm ready to go.  Yeah.  All right.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:17):**  So, so you create this whole, you define this whole under management, you think about where  you want to move it in the future.  What do we want our landscape to look like in the future?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:28):**  What do we want our community to look like in the future?  Like what, what are we actually building towards?  And also we define what kind of quality of life do we want for ourselves?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:41):**  And I think that's something in agriculture, people often have a hard time with.  Because there's a whole cultural thing about just working very, very, very hard, which  is not necessarily bad.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:18:54):**  But really thinking about like, how do we want our quality of life to be like, what's  the way we want to show up to do this work is how I would think about it.  And you have, once you have clarity around that, there's the decision making process  
**[0:19:09-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:19:09):**  that can help you ensure that every management decision you make is working towards achieving  that future resource base and that, that quality of life.  And that's really like what the holistic, what holistic management is.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:19:25):**  And that often gets like used interchangeably with any variety of systems.  It's kind of an over abused term by people that don't fully understand it, I think.  Yeah, like on lots and lots of sides.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:19:42):**  Like I think there's lots of people that just want to turn their cows out on forest allotments  and they're like, the land needs cattle.  Alan Savory said so, and we don't have to do any management of that.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:19:55):**  And then there's also people that are like, all beef is evil, holistic management, something,  something.  I mean, there's just like many, many perspectives that are very warm.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:06):**  That holistic management is voodoo.  It can't be proved to work by science.  We can't replicate it in the lab.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:12):**  It could be managed.  It's kind of the point.  You can't, like the difference is, I mean, the scientific method is reductionist at heart.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:21):**  You have to control all the variables because you're trying to look for a specific outcome.  And the difference with holistic management is you're not trying to control the variables.  You're just trying to monitor the variables and look for signs of failure in your system  
**[0:20:36-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:36):**  and then tweak the biological inputs to resist the failures.  Right.  And I think the other key part is to not have too much attachment to the how of how that's  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:49):**  achieved.  And I think, I mean, that's something that I certainly fall victim to.  Like I love my cows and I just want to do everything with cows.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:20:57):**  And that certainly blinds me sometimes to like, you know, if the only tool you have  is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  Well, if the only tool you have is a cow, everything looks like something that should  
**[0:21:09-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:21:09):**  be grazed.  And I'm trying to like always challenge myself around my own clouded gesture of that situation.  But yeah, I mean, I think like truly holistic management, you don't have any particular  
**[0:21:26-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:21:26):**  technique or practice that you're committed to in terms of like grazing density or like  any rule of thumb.  It's about just constantly adapting in response to your observation of conditions on the ground  
**[0:21:43-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:21:43):**  and really like creating a feedback loop, which is a very scientific approach to land  management.  But it's also, like you said, really hard to prove in these sort of like linear reductionist  
**[0:21:58-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:21:58):**  things that are how a lot of things happen.  How research has to be done because they have to be able to prove an outcome or show an  outcome.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:08):**  And that's, you know, it's just, that's completely against holistic management.  And those of us that do it and live it and know it, you know, kind of, we kind of intuitively  understand that, that you just have to go do it and watch and keep replanning and observing  
**[0:22:25-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:25):**  and making observations.  Yep. So, wow, we did get down a, we did go down quite a rabbit trail about holistic management.  I think I made it to the year 1996.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah, yeah, I think you're about in the late 90s.  Your dad went to holistic training.  You finished school.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah, you finished school.  Oh yeah, 2010.  You've been to college.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:49):**  You were already in college.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Okay, so we're not a little more hosed than that.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah, we made it to college.  Yeah, so I came home in 2010.  I took care of my grandma for the last three years of her life.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:23:02):**  So that was kind of like the thing that drew me back.  But you know, also, I think the interesting thing about that is like, I did have my own  kind of personal transition moment in that time, after I said that I didn't have to have  
**[0:23:19-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:23:19):**  that because my dad just brainwashed me.  But that experience of taking care of my grandma was like so mentally and emotionally challenging  for me.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:23:29):**  And I really like struggled with depression and anxiety a lot during that time.  And my life was like saved by being outside and like being immersed in nature in the natural  world and just made me fall in love with everything about land management in a way that I had  
**[0:23:53-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:23:53):**  never really experienced before.  And that's when I was really a goner for doing the whole ranching thing.  Just like, oh my God, it is so cool to see all of this living stuff and the relationships  
**[0:24:09-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:24:09):**  between it.  And yeah, like it's just endlessly exciting and thrilling to me.  So that's been kind of my own like personal deep dive into why I do what I do.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:24:25):**  But the, gosh, I had another point I really wanted to make about that.  Oh, the other thing that I kind of brought when I moved back to the ranch is in school,  I had become really interested in business and marketing and had watched my dad implement  
**[0:24:41-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:24:41):**  all these great grazing practices and still like kind of struggle financially because  we were so at the mercy of the commodity market and like the volatility of that.  And we don't have like a huge spread.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:24:59):**  I guess I didn't really talk about what the actual ranch is like, but it's a little over  800 acres.  It's on five non-contiguous pieces of property.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:25:06):**  We're split down the middle by I-90, which is an interesting little management quirk  of our place.  Most people don't have an interstate running through the middle of their ranch.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:25:19):**  So it's like it's a decent sized place, but it's not like I'm not going to reach an economy  of scale there where I'm really going to make money on the commodity market and like sustain  my life on the place.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:25:35):**  So I became really interested in direct marketing and we had this great story to tell and I  knew that people were interested in buying our product, but like we not like my dad was  definitely not interested in cultivating that.  
**[0:25:48-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:25:48):**  So that's kind of like the direct marketing program has been a big part of my focus when  I, since I've moved back and we have grown that in kind of an interesting way.  We do like 90 to 95% custom beef.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:26:05):**  So like I still have some quarters.  I don't do farmer's markets.  I don't do, you can't buy a steak from me.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:26:12):**  I won't mail it to you, but I mean, it'll change in the future, but right now that's  like we're set up to sell just like directs to people in our community.  And so your customers are just community members with deep freezers that can actually  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just families.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:26:35):**  That's been kind of our focus.  And like, I think Spokane is a rustic enough place that a lot of people are not super removed  from a time when that was a normal way to eat food.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:26:49):**  Right.  So, yeah, I don't think it's as far outside of like in a more urban place where people  are, you know, don't have a deep freezer or whatever, or think to have a deep freezer  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:00):**  even.  So, you know, the Northwest isn't an area I've really been too much.  I'm not really familiar with it.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:06):**  How far do you have to drive to get your animals slaughtered?  So the bit that's actually a big part of the reason why I've focused on the custom meat  is because I have a butcher that we have a very long standing relationship.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:22):**  It's all it's a, I'm fourth generation of my family.  Third generation of his family.  But like, going back to the beginning of like, both our businesses, our families have worked  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:31):**  together.  And so I just like, I love Jeff.  He's the best butcher on earth.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:40):**  He like, I trust him so much with my animals and my product.  And so like, I really was not interested in trying to create other, I really wanted to  grow that relationship as much as possible and not be trying to figure out other processing  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:27:57):**  venues.  But because he's only custom licensed, then that kind of limited the way I could sell  my product.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:28:05):**  And thankfully, there's enough of a customer base here to support that.  So if I, so I do do a little bit of USDA inspected slaughter and I, there's two plants, they're  both about two hour drive away.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:28:24):**  I usually use the one in Sandpoint, just because I like their meat cutters better.  So that's about a two hour haul for me.  And then a two hour haul to go pick my animals up again when they're done.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:28:35):**  But I try to do that just a couple times a year.  So what about the rest of them?  The rest of my critters?  
**[0:28:46-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:28:46):**  Yeah.  So that's all getting processed on farm with my custom guy.  So the way that I kind of the way that my sales channel works is we have a mailing list.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:01):**  There's deposits that open once a year on February 1st.  I send an email out on February 1st that says it's time to put your deposit in.  This year on February 4th, I sold my last beef and then deposits close for the year  
**[0:29:16-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:16):**  and then I don't do marketing activities beyond that.  This year was really nice.  I've never had it happen.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:26):**  Usually it takes a couple weeks.  This was just like COVID times are so crazy.  Absolutely.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:32):**  It's changed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah.  And like a little, there's a little bit of an end time vibe, I think.  I know like multiple people buy two beef.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:44):**  What are you doing with two beef in a year?  I eat a lot of meat, but that's...  That is a lot of cow.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:51):**  A lot of beef.  Was this a big family maybe?  Yeah.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:29:57):**  Maybe they have like 15 kids.  Yeah.  15 kids and they all play football or something.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:30:08):**  So then I just have Jeff come out to the farm, our harvest schedule is kind of July through  August and he comes out every week or every two weeks and then we kill like five to eight  beef at a time and he just kills them on farm and breaks them down into quarters and then  
**[0:30:30-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:30:30):**  he takes it back to his shop and does all the aging and cutting there.  And then he emails me into hanging weights.  I invoice my customers and they pick it up from him.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:30:42):**  So I don't ever do anything.  I'm just basically trying to live my life so I never have to leave the ranch.  That's the goal.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:30:52):**  I get it.  I get it.  And the more we talk today, the more I'm really, really appreciating the name of your operation.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:31:03):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what the lazy and lazy are for sure.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:31:09):**  I've definitely gave you appreciation for your name.  That's great, Beth.  So on farm harvest, I love that model and I love what you're doing there.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:31:24):**  So tell me a little bit about Link Foods.  Let's shift gears.  Yeah, so Link Foods has been the other passion of my life the last decade or better part  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:31:37):**  of a decade.  It's a company I helped start in 2014 and it's a worker and farmer owned cooperative  food hub.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:31:46):**  So it's a distribution company for local farms.  I mentioned I got really interested in business and marketing.  So after I moved home, then I decided to go back to school and go to business school.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:32:00):**  So I did my MBA at this school called Bainbridge Graduate Institute, which actually doesn't  exist anymore.  Although I don't think that, yes, my business school went out of business.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:32:09):**  No, I don't think that reflects on the quality of my education.  I did learn a lot of stuff there, but it was this small independent business school that  was really focused on using the tools of business to create social goods.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:32:25):**  And through that, I met my business partner, Joel Williamson, and he also had a multi-generation  farming operation in his family.  He grew up growing roses in a greenhouse for cut flowers.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:32:44):**  So he grew up walking around on stilts under two acres of glass, which just sounds very  magical.  And his family business had actually been kind of swallowed up by globalization in the  
**[0:32:56-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:32:56):**  mid 90s.  And the cut flower business with like NAFTA and everything was just, our domestic cut  flower business was pretty much destroyed at that time.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:33:04):**  Plus the consolidation of grocery stores, which was a big market for them.  Anyway, so we were both like really, really interested in food and agriculture and have  long, long time family ties to Spokane.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:33:18):**  And we're like, great.  Let's do these fancy new business degrees.  Let's start a business together.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:33:23):**  And we really tried to look at like the foods, the larger food system of Spokane and figure  out like, okay, what are the things that we need to have like a resilient kind of self-sustaining  food system in our region?  
**[0:33:37-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:33:37):**  And one of the big opportunities that we identified was basically finding channels to move local  food to beyond the farmer's market.  So we had like a small farm scene and a decent farmer's market scene in Spokane, but just  
**[0:33:59-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:33:59):**  not a lot, like unless you were a very specific type of person who was looking for that type  of experience, you were probably not accessing local food if you lived in Spokane.  And when we started the company and our focus until very recently has been opening up wholesale  
**[0:34:16-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:34:16):**  channels.  So we worked with university dining services, Gonzaga University, Washington State University,  which is about an hour and a half to the south of us.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:34:30):**  Yeah, kind of like figuring out how do we help these big institutions and also restaurants  access local food because they want to buy it.  And we know that our farmers want to grow more and the hang ups are just kind of in  
**[0:34:44-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:34:44):**  this distribution network.  So we started the company to really solve those problems.  Also, there's lots of financial challenges to the problem we chose to solve.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:34:58):**  And so we were looking for like a second line of business that had a higher profit margin  to kind of prop the distribution business up until we grew it to a scale where it would  be self-sustaining.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:35:12):**  And that's how I've gotten into the craft malting world.  So we also have a facility that makes, we can make nine tons of craft malt a week, and  that's all locally grown and then sold to brewers and distillers, mostly in the Pacific  
**[0:35:29-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:35:29):**  Northwest where we have a pretty happening brewing and distilling scene.  And COVID has been a really interesting year for the business because we've made a lot  of pivots.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:35:43):**  I'm so tired of saying the word pivot.  Just because of demand though?  Is that why?  
**[0:35:49-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:35:49):**  Well, because, okay, so go back to March of last year when the shutdown started happening  because our business was so focused on institutions, schools, and restaurants, we lost 80% of our  customers basically overnight when the shutdown started.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:36:10):**  So we really had, I mean, we knew it was coming like with a couple of weeks notice, but it  was a pretty serious, oh shit moment.  Like what we have been doing is not what we're doing now.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:36:26):**  And at the same time, people like you were saying are just having this renewed interest  in local food and also experiencing going to the grocery store and not being able to  buy exactly what you want when you want it, which I think was very sobering for a lot  
**[0:36:42-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:36:42):**  of people.  Like, oh man, if we only rely on these really long like value chains to get our product  Really long, overly complex, centralized, subsidized supply chains.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:36:59):**  Right.  So there were things like meat and flour that we had freezers of because they were lining  up to go to institutions and people couldn't find that in the grocery store.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:37:11):**  So there was like, and we'd always had done a little bit of a direct to consumer multi-farm  CSA, but that just really blew up and we launched an a la carte marketplace as well.  And that also helped us realize like how foolish it was that we had been trying to make this  
**[0:37:29-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:37:29):**  wholesale business work and we had never made money doing it.  But we just like kept hoping, I don't know, I still have complicated feelings about it  because on the one hand, I think we we were doing something really important.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:37:45):**  It just didn't make money.  And that doesn't mean that it wasn't a thing worth doing.  And we had like tons of successes through that, that I'm really proud of, but also it  
**[0:37:57-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:37:57):**  was like, okay, we have to focus our time and energy on lines of business that are actually  self-sustaining and revenue positive.  And like, we can't just keep hoping and wishing that something that's not going to work is  
**[0:38:10-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:38:10):**  going to work someday.  So we've made some pretty big shifts in our business.  So going forward, at least for the time being, maybe wholesale is going to come back in some  
**[0:38:20-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:38:20):**  other form in the future, but really focused on this direct to consumer thing, growing  that program.  And the other really interesting thing that we were able to do this last year is we took  
**[0:38:32-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:38:32):**  advantage of a couple different funding programs to do more boxes for food insecure people.  So we're doing the same kind of multi-farm CSA offering, but we were able to get contracts  to give those to food banks and other nonprofit partners.  
**[0:38:47-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:38:47):**  Because obviously food banks have been really kind of crushed this year.  A lot of their labor is volunteer, older folks that are now staying home because of COVID.  And also there's kind of an all time high demand on food banks as they're just more  
**[0:39:03-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:39:03):**  people experiencing food insecurity.  So it was a really cool opportunity for our company to do this thing that we already had  created great proficiency around how to do and get super, just super nutritious, high  
**[0:39:18-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:39:18):**  quality, awesome produce to people that needed it.  And also make sure that all counted on moving product through the co-op this year, we're  actually able to sell theirs.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:39:33):**  So yeah, all in all big win for the link foods team this year, but it was not the funnest  year of my life.  I think we can all agree that we'd rather forget most of 2020 or pretend it didn't happen  
**[0:39:49-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:39:49):**  or go back and redo it.  We will all wake up and it was just a massive, horrible, shared nightmarish hallucination.  But I don't think that's going to happen.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:40:00):**  You hit on a concept that I've been chewing on for a few minutes that the hang ups really  are in the distribution system.  And that's always been the problem.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:40:14):**  I think that's almost always been the problem in agriculture is the people that are way  out in the rural areas with a deep connection to the land.  It's so far away from the urban centers and getting that not only transportation connection,  
**[0:40:34-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:40:34):**  but getting that cultural connection through the food back to the land.  We've totally lost that in the distribution system too.  Well, yeah.  
**[0:40:44-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:40:44):**  And I think that cuts both ways.  I think there's a real disconnect between what farmers do.  I mean, it's the same thing that you just said, what farmers do and their end consumer,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:41:01):**  understanding the cares and the concerns of the people that actually eat the food that  we make.  Because it touches so many hands before it ever gets turned into whiz bang, whatever  
**[0:41:14-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:41:14):**  fancy product you pop in the microwave.  So it goes probably around the world and back before it touches the end consumer.  I saw an infographic the other day.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:41:29):**  We're recording this at the beginning of February in the middle of the polar vortex and it won't  be released for quite a while.  But the other day was just national pizza day.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:41:38):**  Not necessarily a big deal.  I'm sure most people probably don't know about it, but my father-in-law owned a pizza restaurant  so I'm aware.  
**[0:41:47-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:41:47):**  And the infographic I saw broke down a lot of the common ingredients in pizza.  What goes in the dough, the tomato sauce, and a lot of these things that we can't grow  in Kansas or we get from here, here, here, here.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:42:04):**  And I think that infographics like that are a little bit misleading because yes, we grow  a lot of flour here.  Yes, there are places that mill flour here.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:42:14):**  But does that mean that Heat the Hut sources any flour that it uses in Kansas from Kansas?  Probably not.  Maybe the local, I know Dave, he does sources, he does get his flour from a Kansas miller.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:42:31):**  That's cool.  But we've had some conversations with them about what it would take to maybe have a more  local offering on his menu and just how to get that supply chain going.  
**[0:42:46-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:42:46):**  And as a restaurant owner, he doesn't have time to go out and find all those things.  And if people local would grow this stuff at a fair price and offer it to them, and  there was some kind of a distribution network or something like a food hub, then it would  
**[0:43:10-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:43:10):**  enable that commerce.  Right.  That's exactly the kind of barriers that we were setting out to solve.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:43:18):**  Time complexity, quantity, and insurance.  Those are the main barriers.  The insurance thing is really when you get to talk, talking to institutional buyers that  
**[0:43:30-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:43:30):**  contract their food service out to a company like Sodexo or Aramark or Bon Appetit or whatever.  A lot of those larger companies are like multi-billion, multinational corporations that don't just  let farmer Joe Blow become a vendor so that the local small college can buy tomatoes from  
**[0:43:53-0:44:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:43:53):**  him.  You have to hold a $5 million liability insurance policy to apply to become a vendor with Sodexo.  And that's just not a cost that it makes sense for a small farmer to bear because it's not  
**[0:44:09-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:44:09):**  made for them.  So that was kind of part of why we really wanted to start Link is how could we get a  bunch of farmers together to share those costs so that we could actually access those channels.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:44:26):**  It's just like the unfortunate fact that even though there were a lot of restaurants and  wholesale buyers that wanted to work with us, it just wasn't enough.  We needed to have like 14 more customers like Washington State University or Gonzaga in  
**[0:44:44-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:44:44):**  order to do the business in a way that was actually going to be profitable.  And that just didn't exist in Spokane.  So yeah, I mean, the other interesting thing about food hubs is that they're so community  
**[0:44:58-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:44:58):**  and context driven.  Every community's food hub, like the places where they exist are so different based on  kind of the local conditions and what the customer base is like.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:45:12):**  What are some commonalities you've seen between food hubs or between successful food hubs?  That's a great question.  I really think community partnerships are probably the most important thing because  
**[0:45:34-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:45:34):**  like everything is so contextual.  The food hubs that are really successful are ones that understand how to engage with like  a broad, like intersectional segment of the communities that they're existing in.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:45:52):**  I think there's been a lot of really awesome cooperation between food hubs as well.  There's a really robust community of practice.  Like there's an email listserv, people are always talking about like, what software are  
**[0:46:08-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:46:08):**  you guys using?  How are you solving this new proposed FSMA traceability rule?  There's just a lot of like exchange of information.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:46:19):**  And it's also because like it's pretty locally focused.  There's not really a feeling of like competitiveness.  Like if a food hub from Minneapolis calls me and has a question, I'm like, there's  
**[0:46:34-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:46:34):**  no incentive for me to not tell them the answer because I'm not like protecting some trade  secret.  They're going to like blow up and come take over my market share or something.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:46:45):**  Like there are communities that have multiple food hubs.  Like Seattle is a big city.  There's like multiple food hub type operations happening there.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:46:55):**  But it seems like for the most part, people just have a very cooperative vibe and that's  really pleasant to be around.  Like we're all just in this to try and figure out how to have like a nicer planet to live  
**[0:47:09-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:09):**  on.  There's no need to be like not working together to that end.  That's my kumbaya moment of the podcast.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:18):**  Yeah.  Collaborative.  There's a, yeah, I like that.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:24):**  I like to say that, you know, we should all identify as human beings, stewards of Spaceship  Earth.  Oh, that's sweet.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:34):**  And think that way.  So I want to keep talking about food hubs and what's some good advice you might have  to people that are thinking that it might be a good idea for them to start a food hub  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:53):**  or start organizing one in their community?  No, don't ask that question right now.  I haven't even got to pay.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:47:59):**  Is that another hour?  Halfway down my page of questions you had back.  We're going to have to have her back on.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:48:05):**  Yeah, we're definitely going to have to have you back, Beth.  Two-parter.  All right.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:48:10):**  So the, oh man, I've been thinking like, I've been thinking a lot about this, like, would  I do this again or how would I do this again if I was going to start over?  Well first of all, I would say there are a lot of resources out there already.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:48:32):**  The food hub movement is really growing.  So I would say check out the Wallace Center.  That's kind of like the nonprofit that does a lot of food hub work.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:48:43):**  They do benchmarking studies.  So they'll send surveys out to like a bunch of different food hubs in the country and  collect metrics and like what's the average revenue and profit margin and kind of like  
**[0:48:58-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:48:58):**  what's the sales per FTE, all kinds of handy metrics to look at like what models of food  hubs are financially successful.  So I would say definitely take advantage of any resources like that.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:49:15):**  The other thing that I think was really important and I wish we had done even more of, although  I don't know, I guess you always wish you had done more, is like really, really understanding  the needs of the farmers and the customers that you're trying to serve before ever doing  
**[0:49:36-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:49:36):**  anything.  So Joel's background is in community organizing.  So we already had kind of a natural approach to that and that like we just took a community  
**[0:49:47-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:49:47):**  organizing framework to engaging with farmers.  So we had tons and tons of meetings where actually this was really great.  We had this partnership with Gonzaga because they really, really wanted to figure out how  
**[0:50:02-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:02):**  to buy local for their dining hall.  And they would do, and the guys that rent, they're both retired, so I don't think I'm  going to get anyone in trouble, but the guys that were running dining just like did so  
**[0:50:12-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:12):**  much to try and help us get things off the ground.  So they would pay for catering for us to have meetings where we could serve everybody like  a nice big supper.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:25):**  And that's a great way to get people to show up to shit.  It's like, well, you're going to get like a three course meal.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:32):**  Always.  Yeah.  And it wasn't like pizza hot dogs.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:35):**  Like they really would go all out.  Good food, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:39):**  Really nice catered dinners for these things.  Which yeah, I have no idea if they had authorization to do that, but they really helped us just  get people to turn up and talk to us.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:50:52):**  We also had a great relationship through Washington State University Extension Office in Spokane.  So their small farms team was super supportive of us just like helping get farmers together  and talk to folks.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:51:09):**  And the other thing that's kind of, I think, special and also something I would do totally  different is that Link is also a worker.  So we're a farmer and worker owned cooperative, which means that all the employees are also  
**[0:51:25-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:51:25):**  owners of the business, which I think is awesome and like probably the coolest thing about  Link.  However, I knew nothing about how to start a company when I started Link because I'd  
**[0:51:36-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:51:36):**  never started the company before.  And I think understanding how to get a team of human beings to work together really effectively,  especially when you're trying to do everything in a very non-hierarchical, non-traditional,  
**[0:51:55-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:51:55):**  creative way is super hard.  And I definitely think that we made plenty of missteps along the way.  But I don't know how I could have learned any of that stuff without the experience of  
**[0:52:12-0:52:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:52:12):**  trying to start a company because I was like 25 when I started Link or 26.  So yeah, I'd never really had a real job even before.  But I think that it's really, really cool to go from where we were as a startup team  
**[0:52:34-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:52:34):**  of two or three people to now having 11 employees and feel like we actually do have a structure  where people have tons of autonomy.  And we also do a pretty good job of making collective decisions and doing that in a way  
**[0:52:48-0:53:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:52:48):**  that's efficient and effective.  I think that's been really, really fun to watch unfold.  And I think that our team is making better decisions because of it.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:53:01):**  I hope we are.  Right.  So a couple episodes ago, we had Mike Calacrate on.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:53:12):**  And Beth, I don't know if you know Mike CK, she's over there smiling because she remembers  the conversation.  I mean, that guy's just amazing.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:53:22):**  He's floating around the idea of community cooperative nonprofit food hubs where it's  you know, or where the city community provides the space and it's operated on a non for profit  basis as a food hub.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:53:39):**  What do you have any thoughts on that?  Yeah, I mean, I think that that sounds super cool.  Like co-ops are great.  
**[0:53:47-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:53:47):**  I think multi stakeholder co-ops are even cooler.  So yeah, we've talked about like, would we want to ever open up a membership, like an  ownership class that was our customers or community members.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:54:04):**  I think we're, I think we are busy enough figuring out the complexity that we're managing  right now.  But that doesn't mean that we might not do that in the future.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:54:16):**  And yes, absolutely.  I think that there should be more public funding and support for the kind of work that we're  doing because it's kind of like as I was alluding to earlier, the work that we were doing as  
**[0:54:31-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:54:31):**  a wholesale distributor, like we didn't stop doing it because there wasn't value in it.  It's just that on the economy or on the scale that we were trying to do it at with the tools  that we had at our disposal, we couldn't make money doing it.  
**[0:54:48-0:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:54:48):**  And that doesn't mean that it wasn't worth doing or that it won't be worth doing it again.  So I don't know, like you can call that a subsidy.  You can call that a community utility.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:55:04):**  But that's certainly something that I would love to see.  Well, city of Spokane has a lot of problems, but it'd be super great if they put some funding  towards that.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:55:15):**  Not going to lie.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, distribution and having a place to gather.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:55:25):**  One of the other things that Mike said was you got to keep the developers out.  You got to keep the big business and the big developers out.  And I can see where he definitely has a point.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:55:38):**  The power needs to be with the people and connecting people to their food.  Yeah.  So Beth, let's shift gears again.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:55:55):**  I know you've got Deep Roots there by Spokane.  Have you ever thought about if you could pick up and go anywhere in the world and ranch  livestock food production?  
**[0:56:06-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:56:06):**  Where would you go?  Oh, that's a hard question.  I do kind of wish I could go on pause and do a bit of a world tour.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:56:17):**  I would love to do some range riding in Idaho with Alderspring Ranch.  That seems like it'd be super dope to wander around up there.  I only want to do it for two weeks though.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:56:30):**  Like I said, it seems like way too much work, but I wouldn't go right into the whole in  hurting thing.  No, no, no.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:56:36):**  But I'm up there in the mountains.  Yeah, no, but I wanted to go ride a pony around for two weeks.  That seems like that'd be great.  
**[0:56:42-0:57:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:56:42):**  A little camping trip.  Gosh, I got to work with bison last year for the first time with my friends up in Alberta.  Sweetgrass bison, Cody and Julia Mitchell and Cody Spencer.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:07):**  So I would love to go play around with bison some more.  I really want to go back to New Zealand.  Yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:15):**  There's a lot of cool stuff going on.  Okay.  What are a couple things you can't live without?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:24):**  Oh, I don't know.  I'm pretty low maintenance.  I get that.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:35):**  I don't know.  You know, I love my I love my plumber.  That's one if I was gonna just keep one if I had to survive in the woods.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:47):**  I'd want like a jacket and a plumber.  A plumber.  What is that?  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:52):**  Yeah, yeah, they're made.  They're made in Texas.  They're great.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:57:57):**  It's like the best fencing pliers ever.  Look it up.  And they're like really hard steel.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:02):**  They don't get dull like the crap you buy at the feed store.  Yeah, we'll check those out here.  Yeah, second.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:08):**  Lamer.  I've never if probably something I've seen and we just don't speak their language on  there a bit.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:15):**  But they're a bit spendy.  Well, I think I think their particular product is called the plamer.  But who the heck makes it I can't remember if you Google plamer it'll, it'll pop up right  
**[0:58:25-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:25):**  there made in Texas.  So you know, being fourth generation yourself and I'm, you know, stick second or whatever.  I'm multi generational myself.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:37):**  What would be some tips you'd have for somebody that's wanting to get started livestock or  protein production themselves through production?  Oh, some of the ones to get started.  
**[0:58:47-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:58:47):**  Well, okay, this is where I do myself plug obviously should come to new cowgirl camp,  which is the intensive course that I host on my ranch for women that want to get started  in ranching and raising livestock.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:59:01):**  And we do have that column we do on the guys could come to as well.  Yeah, because y'all complained so much about being excluded from agriculture and I just  couldn't stand it anymore.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:59:14):**  So yeah, we also do a new rancher camp that is mixed a mixed gender with with fellows  allowed as well.  Well, let's keep talking about your new cowgirl camp.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:59:26):**  That's a I think that's a really, really cool thing.  And it's kind of a unique thing.  How long have you been doing that?  
**[0:59:33-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:59:33):**  Let's see, this will be our, our fourth year.  It's kind of a collaboration with actually a bunch of folks that were trained in holistic  management in the mid 90s with my dad during that that Kellogg project through Washington  
**[0:59:50-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=0:59:50):**  State University.  It's just a group of holistic management practitioners who have stayed in touch for the last 20 years.  And so one of that they've kind of formed this nonprofit roots of resilience that I  
**[1:00:03-1:00:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:00:03):**  joined up with to do education and outreach around holistic management in the Pacific  Northwest, we were a savory hub for a little bit.  And through doing that work, I kind of became frustrated with having field days and tours  
**[1:00:24-1:00:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:00:24):**  and having these like rancher dudes come to my place and look at my grazing chart, blah,  blah, blah, and, and then be like, well, that's great.  But that'll never work on my place because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:00:38):**  And it's like, Okay, why like, why are we even doing this?  And and so we really work here.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:00:48-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:00:48):**  It's like, well, okay, we're, we've been doing a couple years of trying to do these classes  and, and field days and stuff.  And it's like, I can't really point you to any person who's changed their practices.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:02):**  Because like they came and saw my grass on one day.  So at the same time, I kept like meeting all these people that were like, Oh, what you're  doing is so cool.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:13):**  And I wish I could learn how to do that.  And, and like had no reservations about like, open heartedly embracing like, Oh, yeah, of  course, nature functions and holes.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:26):**  And it makes sense to like, try to make your livestock behave like wildlife and, and simulate  those grazing patterns that like, it just seemed like I was talking to all these people  outside of ag that would instantly get it and understand.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:41):**  And anyone I was talking to who was already in it was just like, rah, rah, rah, rah, that  won't work.  Okay.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:47):**  Okay.  30 years ago, and it didn't work.  And we would Yeah, so so we kind of started thinking about like, all right, maybe we really  
**[1:01:53-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:01:53):**  need to focus our training efforts.  Like if we're going to do training, we need to focus our training efforts on new people.  And, and one of the people in this group, Sandy Matheson, she's also a lady like myself,  
**[1:02:09-1:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:02:09):**  and is a multi generation, they call it farms on the west side of the Cascades.  I don't know why it changes when you go over there, but our third generation farmer on  her family farm, and she also raises grass fed beef.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:02:23):**  And I've known her as a family friend for a long time.  But she's like a boomer, I guess I'm a millennial.  But she also is a retired veterinarian, and was like one of the first women to graduate  
**[1:02:37-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:02:37):**  from veterinary school at Washington State University.  And so has been has been like pioneering as a woman and ranching much longer than me.  But like we were, you know, I've kind of been talking and it's like, a lot of the same stupid  
**[1:02:52-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:02:52):**  stuff has happened to both of us, like even though there's 30 year age gap, and it's like,  okay, well, what if we just create like a space for women to learn about this stuff  that doesn't have any of the annoying sexist crap, and is really just about like a holistic,  
**[1:03:13-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:03:13):**  integrated framework and approach.  And, and like, I don't know, let's try intimidating.  Yeah, yeah, just like super supportive, celebratory environment, like no one's gonna laugh at  
**[1:03:26-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:03:26):**  you because you can't do 20 push ups or have a hard time like closing a wire gate.  Someone will just show you how to get better leverage so you can close the wire gate.  Cheater bar.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:03:35):**  Yeah, yeah, like it's like, just you can solve every problem with a cheater bar.  That's like the best thing my grandpa ever taught me.  So so we just sort of like really, okay, well, let's put together like a women's camp and  
**[1:03:48-1:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:03:48):**  see, see how that goes and see who shows up.  And we had the most amazing group of gals come out.  And we created like this kind of introductory level curriculum that was the basic holistic  
**[1:04:03-1:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:04:03):**  management stuff.  So you create a holistic context, we go through the decision making framework, we teach them  how to do a grazing plan, you learn basic ecological monitoring, low stress livestock  
**[1:04:14-1:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:04:14):**  handling, I put a flock of sheep in my yard, and everybody gets to like experience flight  zones and applying pressure and teach them how to build a fence, how to do some like  basic fencing and facilities design.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:04:31):**  It's just and then because Sandy's a vet, we do kind of the whole animal husbandry stuff,  we put a cow in the headgate palpate cow, you know, just kind of learn.  And then usually it also aligns with a day that we're doing on the heart on farm butcher.  
**[1:04:46-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:04:46):**  So we can like talk about anatomy and then see the whole process on farm slaughter.  That's usually what we do on day one after breakfast and like, Hello, my name is now  it's like, and now we will look at the room and,  
**[1:05:00-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:00):**  and now we're going to disassemble a cow.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's, you know,  
**[1:05:05-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:05):**  how many dropouts do you have?  None.  I've never lost anyone.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:10):**  I hope people get a little like,  but everybody's really hung in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:20):**  Last year, we we butchered a heifer that that was pregnant that I didn't know.  And so we even had a fetus.  That's cool.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:30):**  I mean, I think it's interesting.  I, I just am like fascinated by biology and stuff.  So that stuff doesn't bug me.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:36):**  I think it's cool.  Anyway, so so it's kind of this just like very broad introductory level five day curriculum.  And we had this amazing group of women that came and it was just like the best course  
**[1:05:48-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:05:48):**  I've ever taught.  So it was like, yeah, let's do more of this.  And, and then the second year, we had a photographer from the New York Times contact me and she  
**[1:06:00-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:00):**  was like, I'm doing this series on women ranching in the West and like, can I come shoot cowgirl  camp if they don't pick up the story, I'll give you all the photos for promotional purposes.  Like, excellent.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:11):**  That'd be a great thing to do.  So Amanda Lucey came out and shot the story and that ended up going in the New York Times  in 2018 which, you know, I just had like a one but then it's just kind of like sure,  
**[1:06:26-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:26):**  what to make sure we linked that in the show notes page.  I haven't seen Yeah, oh, yeah, it's great.  Yeah, came out a couple years ago.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:31):**  It's a really, the photos in our beautiful.  A lot of really cool women that I've actually gotten to know that were also featured in  that article.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:40):**  So yeah, it's a, it's a good one.  Yeah, and so then it just sort of like, can't became this thing because once you're in the  New York Times, like, you got to keep going, I guess I mean, again, as literally in the  
**[1:06:53-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:53):**  Times, it must be true.  Pretty.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:06:57):**  Then you get like reality TV, people and stuff that start contacting you.  My phone was ringing off really?  Oh, so crazy.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:03):**  I was not prepared for that.  But yeah, if any of you ever get in the New York Times, just just be prepared.  You prepared.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:10):**  A lot of a lot of New York and Los Angeles area codes start popping up on your phone.  It's a very weird time in my life.  I'm so sick of trying to get sold.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:22):**  Extended warranty for my car or another vacation at Mary.  Oh, yeah, I want a lot of answer any number that's not in my phone.  They can talk to voicemail, then you know, I'll call you back if you're legit.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:33):**  But yeah, same.  Yeah, that'll be I don't know, that might be an interesting day for me when I start  getting those calls.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:43):**  Maybe it'll happen.  Maybe it won't.  Yeah, just just get an agent first.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:46):**  I didn't know.  I wish someone had a layer of protection against them.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:07:54-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:54):**  I am not doing a reality TV show, by the way.  Sorry to disappoint you guys.  I would watch it.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:07:59):**  No, no, I think that would be so interesting.  I wouldn't want to do it either.  But I would definitely watch too.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:06):**  I still get it.  I still get an inquiry now and then it's so funny.  Just weird.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:11):**  Anyway, but like that, that's kind of where cowgirl camp was born.  And now we're doing that like this last year for COVID.  We did it as an online webinar, which was actually really cool.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:23):**  And we're going to keep it as a we're going to keep the webinar option.  And it's a winter winter version because we actually had a ton of people come that for  whatever reason couldn't get away for five days to come out here to the ranch and the  
**[1:08:36-1:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:36):**  once a week webinar format work better for them.  So that was actually a really cool thing to experiment with and learn how to do.  And yeah, we'll be back on hopefully conditions permitting will be back on in person programming  
**[1:08:51-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:51):**  this summer.  Yes, you can sign up at new cowgirl camp calm.  By April, I will actually have the website updated.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:08:59):**  So it'll be time.  And even new cowboy camp too will be there.  Yep, yep.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:09:09):**  Yeah.  And that one actually will be hosted at Sandy's place, which is in Bellingham.  It's got an hour and a half north of Seattle.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:09:19):**  Cool, cool, cool, cool.  So you bought me you caught me with a without a question ready.  So what are some of the things that inspire you to be your best self?  
**[1:09:35-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:09:35):**  Oh, so that's such a nice question.  Um, oh, gosh, what inspires me to be my best self?  I mean, I just like I just think the world is so great.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:09:56):**  Like it's such a great place.  Like it's so freakin beautiful.  I'm looking at my window right now.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:10:02):**  And even though it's a freaking cold outside.  Like what, what cool trees and and probably little frozen birdies out there and, and plants  and animals and like, man, just what a freaking gift that that like all these atoms in my  
**[1:10:19-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:10:19):**  body, love together for this moment in time so that I can experience all of this like,  why not try to make the best of it?  Just ponder the miracle of human consciousness and our existence in the ecosystem.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:10:37):**  Yeah.  Can you tell that I'm kind of a stoner Brian?  Is that coming through in my answer?  
**[1:10:43-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:10:43):**  Never, you know, not not judge.  Shocking.  I mean, man, it's just like what, what, what a freaking cool place, even though it's a  
**[1:10:55-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:10:55):**  shit show out there.  Like, yeah, I mean, all the rules we live by are made up and, and we could just make  up whatever kind of world we want to live in.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:11:07):**  So why not make up the best one possible?  That goes back to something my friend Hobbes said, you know, we manifest our own reality.  That's part of having a shared, shared vision, shared holistic context.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:11:26):**  You know, you have a shared goal that you're striving for.  And you take conscious actions daily.  You know, to strive as always trying to move in the right direction.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:11:40):**  You know, always, always trying to move in the right direction.  And eventually that reality that you desire that vision that you share with others will  manifest itself.  
**[1:11:50-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:11:50):**  At least that's the theory, right?  We'll see worth trying anyway.  alternative.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:00):**  A lot of the other stuff we've tried hasn't worked.  So why not try something new?  That's for sure.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:06):**  So if you can have if you can have dinner, a meal with any three people alive or dead,  who would they be?  Oh, shoot.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:16):**  Dang, I feel like you had you had to give me time to think about these.  These are hard.  I feel I've known about this question for weeks, and I still sit up at late at night  
**[1:12:25-1:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:25):**  and think about I don't know who it would really be because I there's so many options.  Oh, man.  Uh, gosh, I right now I just miss my friends like who I want to have dinner.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:40):**  Just it's just like some of my good, good pals, but I want to invite more than three.  Like I just really, I really, really miss hanging out people and having a brewski and  and just like,  
**[1:12:54-1:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:12:54):**  not having conference season this fall and winter.  Yeah, I'm really mentally trying on all of us.  I've missed the the quivera my quivera hangout time this year.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:05):**  That's always a nice week.  Yeah, yep.  So yeah, I guess we'll table that one and leave that one for later.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:15):**  Sorry, I'll keep thinking if I come with a better answer.  Right.  So, we are kind of we are kind of getting close to the end of our time here.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:23):**  So we like to turn it around at the end and give you a chance to ask CK and I a couple  of questions.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:30):**  Well,  let's see.  Let's just don't throw the dinner.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:36):**  The dinner guest.  I have no answers.  I won't turn it around on you.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:45):**  Let's see.  CK, I just want to know what you're doing right now.  Like what is your life like?  
**[1:13:52-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:52):**  I know.  I've okay, so just to give a little context.  I know I've been super private on social media lately, just because I'm tired of it.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:13:59):**  Like I am burnt out on, you know, telling everyone what I'm up to and then people being  negative and whatever.  I am in Midwest.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:07):**  I'm actually, yeah, I think it's a common thread after last year.  So I've been like, I've been actually really loving my privacy.  But I'm in Kansas.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:17):**  So Joel's about to finish vet school here.  I'm not living in the Caribbean any longer.  So when Beth and I met, I was living in the Caribbean, ping ponging around all different  
**[1:14:27-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:27):**  states doing stuff for Pasture Map, still working with Pasture Map.  And we're moving to Idaho in July.  So I'll probably be like five hours from you.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:37):**  Oh my God, that's so great.  Oh, I'm getting four hours away.  Now.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:43):**  Yeah.  And I'm not going to come visit you anytime soon, Brian, because it's so cold and I don't  want to come help you break ice.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:50):**  That's okay.  You come you come during fire season.  Not the time exactly.  
**[1:14:54-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:54):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  
**[1:14:58-1:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:14:58):**  Brian, I just want to know what like, actually, I just want to know what life looks for you  right now to Oh, other than being cold.  Record old and  
**[1:15:13-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:15:13):**  you know, I, I did try to plan for the worst case scenario, you know, last summer for this  winter, you know, made sure I had plenty of hay, plenty of protein around in case we got,  you know, a snow that stayed around for two weeks, which happens right now we've got ice  
**[1:15:32-1:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:15:32):**  for, you know, it's going to be here for going on two weeks.  I did leave enough stockpile and the wind is was just right on the ranch, where like  the taller stock, the taller stems bent over and sheltered a lot of undergrowth on the  
**[1:15:50-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:15:50):**  lee side of the plants.  So there's, there's still forage out there they can get to.  I did break down the other day and I hauled some bales.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:01):**  Not real proud of but I, I went ahead and I hauled some bales, because I'm hopefully  getting going to leave next week for a few days and I wanted to try to get them a little  bit extra energy.  
**[1:16:12-1:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:12):**  The problem is coming up, it's going to get even colder than it's been we've already broken  almost every record we have for oldest longest, you know, in a row below freezing.  Like there's things freezing up here that have never frozen up like our tree.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:28):**  I think my negative 15.  Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.  It's getting it's getting really bad.  
**[1:16:36-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:36):**  So way worse than the worst case planning scenario.  So I have I have gone ahead and and hauled out some hay, even gave them a bale of alfalfa  and for 100 cows and about 25 calves, I think they've got in protein tubs out there right  
**[1:16:54-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:54):**  now.  30% protein tubs.  So they got everything they could possibly need.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:16:59):**  I'm trying to do everything I can to give them enough energy, enough protein to get  through the cold and just cross my fingers and open that most that that most of them  are still here when the weather starts to clear.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:17:12):**  Other than that, you know, looking forward to I've got most of my grazing agreements  already done for this coming growing season.  By the time this episode airs, we'll be getting cattle on the ranch and start and be making  
**[1:17:27-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:17:27):**  the last preps to stock and we're looking forward to fire season, prescribed burning  season.  A lot of guys like to burn here around right at the end of the dormant season right before  
**[1:17:38-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:17:38):**  spring green up.  I'm shifting more to a summer burning program.  But you know, that doesn't mean I don't have to go help my neighbors and in March, April  
**[1:17:50-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:17:50):**  and May when they want to burn so that coming up too.  So now things are about ready to get busy out here in Kansas as soon as the weather  starts to warm up.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:17:59):**  So yeah, I'm ready for it.  Definitely, definitely ready for spring.  Two weeks ago, I probably wouldn't have said that but after this cold snap, I'm done with  
**[1:18:13-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:18:13):**  it.  Just done with it.  I've always wanted to visit Alaska.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:18:17):**  I never really contemplated how I would have to ranch there.  And the guys that do it up there like, oh, the kilter family that's on Discovery.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/8--Beth-Robinette-Appreciating-Holistic-Thinking-eulejc#t=1:18:31):**  Yeah, yeah, that's not quite for me.  Yeah, that's a level of intensity.  I'm not up for it.

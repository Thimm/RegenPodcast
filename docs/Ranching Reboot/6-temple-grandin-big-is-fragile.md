**[0:00:33-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:00:33):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher back for another episode of Ranching Reboot.  Coming to you every Monday.  Sometimes we come out on Thursdays with bonus episodes.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:03):**  Those are kind of random.  So riding with me today, as always, is my good buddy, my co-host CK.  And we're going to change it up.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:11):**  Today I get interviewers of the guest.  And ever since we started this podcast, I thought we want this person on.  We really want to talk to this person.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:22):**  And they've been involved in the livestock industry for close to 40 years now.  They've transformed from the bottom up a lot of things that we do in the industry and  a lot of ways that we think about cattle in the industry.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:37):**  Highly unique mind.  So without any further ado, I want to welcome the one and only Temple Grand into Ranching  Reboot.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:45):**  Temple, welcome to the show.  It's great to be here.  Temple, I got to say, it is an honor to be able to talk with you and I really appreciate  
**[0:01:53-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:01:53):**  you taking the time to visit with us.  Okay, well great.  So some things that we discussed earlier that we really want to cover is you talked about  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:02):**  we want to talk about some sister agility.  I don't think I ask you a lot of the commonly asked our guests like, who are you and how  did you get where you're at?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:10):**  I think that's a little bit superfluous if nobody's heard of Temple Grand at this point.  I think you're kind of legendary.  So if you want to just dive right into it.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:18):**  I also want to talk about the...  No, I want to just dive right in.  There's a lot of people that think that everything is livestock, directly to the environment.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:25):**  I've been getting more and more interested in regenerative grazing systems that can improve  the land, cover crops that are rotated with other crops and then graze animals on it.  And if they do these things right, they can actually improve soil.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:41):**  And you've got a lot of innovative people out there starting to do these.  And I think it needs to be really encouraged.  That's one of the things we're really trying to do with this podcast.  
**[0:02:50-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:02:50):**  We're trying to get some of these stories told and give people a place to tell their  stories and hopefully inspire others.  Well, what you need to do is be getting different innovators on the podcast that can tell about  
**[0:03:01-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:01):**  what they did.  Also, what I've learned about regenerative agriculture is that it's very, very local  site specific.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:09):**  Something that works in one part of the country would not work somewhere else.  Some people ask me about it and I say, you better get really good local advice on what  to do and what works.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:20):**  I've been getting that Stockman Grass Farmer newspaper that has a lot of innovative stuff  in it.  I read that.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:28):**  The thing that's true in every industry, I don't care whether it's electronics or whether  it's agriculture, the little guys innovate.  The little people innovate.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:36):**  That's the way it's been for just about ever since.  The big guys don't often do the innovation.  Things that originally were looked at as far out or alternative, then 20 years later, 10  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:48):**  years later, it becomes mainstream.  I've seen that probiotics in chicken.  I remember when the industry was laughing at that.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:03:55):**  Then in 2020, it was giant banners hanging down the escalator at the big international  food show.  That's something that small producers innovate.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:07):**  Why do you think that is?  Do you think because they're not as scared of failure because they're at a lower scale  or they just understand things better?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:15):**  No, I think what happens with big corporations, and this is true in every field, not just  ag.  They get bureaucratic hardening of the arteries.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:23):**  Let's look at Kodak.  Kodak right here in Fort Collins had a gigantic plant for making film.  They invented some of the digital camera stuff originally and they just let themselves go  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:37):**  broke.  They were just about broke.  They failed to adapt to the changing market from film to digital.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:42):**  They didn't adapt.  Even back in the 70s, they used to call this bureaucratic hardening of the artery.  The innovators that might have inside the company, they just can't get through all the  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:55):**  bureaucracy.  Right.  A lot of things start out very small.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:04:59):**  Think about some of the tech companies like Google and Facebook start out in dorm room.  That's an example of a little guy innovating.  That's true for a lot of very innovative things.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:08):**  They started out really small.  It doesn't matter what field it's in.  I've been throwing around the term institutional inertia for quite a while.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:16):**  The larger an institution is, the longer it's been lurching in one direction, the harder  it is to change that direction.  It's sort of like trying to get a giant ship to change direction.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:26):**  Yeah.  Kind of the same thing.  They just get entrenched.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:31):**  What are some of the things that people can do to start moving that lever?  One of the things I think has been moving some of the things is with COVID.  We learned big is fragile.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:42):**  There was a terrible situation where the big meat packing plant shut down.  There's no place to slaughter pigs until they had to just destroy on the farm 300,000 head  of pigs.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:05:53):**  That's totally terrible.  People started seeing shelves stripped.  Supply chain disruptions were getting more and more of that.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:00):**  Big is fragile.  A fire in an electronic chip factory in Japan now has caused car manufacturers to slow down  a whole bunch and they had to shut a plant because they can't get electronic chips.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:13):**  That's just one more example of big is fragile.  Big, when it works, is very efficient.  It can do a really good job, but when it breaks, you're in trouble.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:22):**  If you have a more distributed supply chain, it's going to be more expensive to get whatever  product comes out of that supply chain.  But when something breaks, it doesn't wreck the whole supply chain.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:32):**  It's resilient.  Right after COVID shut down the great big pork plant, I got all kinds of people wanting  to build small beef plants, both medium-sized and very small ones, ranchers that want to  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:44):**  sell direct, all kinds of inquiries.  And plants have been built.  I can remember when we had a more distributed supply chain.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:06:52):**  And the mistake that was made back in the 80s when a lot of that shut down is that they  simply couldn't compete price-wise with the big ones.  Now the way to have a more distributed supply chain coexist, we need to be following the  
**[0:07:07-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:07:07):**  model of our beer industry, where you have little tiny craft brewers that are expensive  coexisting with the great big Budweiser plant that we've got right here in Fort Collins.  The small guys have to have a niche.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:07:20):**  Now in an emergency, they can fill in, but they can't compete head-to-head with the big  guys on costs.  No way.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:07:27):**  Now you go down to New Zealand, and I've been to meat plants down there.  They have quite a few what they call boutique plants.  They'll do an order of maybe 200 boxes, very, very small orders.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:07:38):**  That's their niche.  And there's nowhere that we can find to do that in this country.  If you can't get a semi-load or if you can't get a container load lot of product, you don't  
**[0:07:49-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:07:49):**  want to have your phone call.  Well, I think people are going to be getting less that way because we're realizing that  the supply chain for generic pharmaceuticals, really common drugs like an antibiotic, you  
**[0:08:00-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:00):**  might need and you're really sick.  That supply chain gets disrupted.  I've been looking at vaccine supply chains, there's a little tiny filter or some other  
**[0:08:09-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:09):**  tiny little ingredient or part they need that comes from one place.  It's true for many, many, many different products.  And I think the thing that's the wake-up call is when you see the shelves stripped in the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:21):**  store, then people go, whoa, there's a problem.  I remember reading an interview one time, somebody back East when we had all those hurricanes  and storms and some lady said, I wasn't scared until I watched them strip the shelves at  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:35):**  Walmart.  Then I got scared.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:38):**  That was for me too, though.  That was like, oh, maybe I should do something.  Nobody panics when there's food on the shelf.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:45):**  Nobody panics except for a refrigerator.  The food is stripped off the shelves.  I think a lot of these things are going to start one small innovator at a time.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:08:57):**  And there's an interesting thing with plant evolution that I read with a review of a book  in a Wall Street Journal and it talked about the circulatory system and the leaf of the  primitive plants like the ginkgo and the more modern plant.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:09:11):**  And the ginkgo, if you look at it, just has straight lines.  So if an insect eats it or something rips the leaf, the leaf is going to die because  it just has one route to get its water and nutrients.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:09:22):**  Where the more modern trees, they have a circuitous route through the leaf.  So if the caterpillar or something eats it, the leaf can still get nutrition.  Now that more security route takes more energy and materials to build.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:09:36):**  But modern plants figured out that a more distributed supply chain was a good thing.  So what can we do moving forward?  You know, where you-  
**[0:09:44-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:09:44):**  Well, I think what's happening moving forward is that you're getting a lot of people stepping  forward and realizing in all kinds of businesses.  Because I read Business Week in the Wall Street Journal and they're getting very concerned  
**[0:10:00-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:00):**  about these big centralized supply chains, not just for agriculture products, but for  lots of other things too.  And that maybe we need to not put all our eggs in one basket.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:10):**  And we're realizing now that gigantic container ships that hold 20,000 containers.  They just don't such a good idea.  It sucks sideways right now in the Suez Canal right now if we talk.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:20):**  Oh really?  We are going to air this next Monday.  So maybe by the time this airs, that traffic jam will be unjammed.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:28):**  I've actually been to the Suez Canal.  But it already has a hundred ships, but there's a point where you get a container shipped  too big.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:34):**  And some of the shipping companies are realizing that maybe a ship that big is not a good idea.  Because when something goes wrong, you're in trouble.  And then I read in the paper they might have to unload the containers while it's stuck  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:47):**  there.  That's kind of…  That'd be a fun logistical puzzle to figure out.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:10:55):**  How do you get a floating crane out there to offload containers?  Most construction cranes won't pick up that kind of weight.  You see, when I think about things like this, it's not abstract.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:06):**  I am a visual thinker.  Everything I think about is pictures.  And I'm thinking of different construction cranes.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:13):**  They can't pick up containers.  It's too heavy.  And I see that.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:17):**  They used to work in construction.  And when I think about these supply chains, nothing's abstract.  I think part of the problem is you've got business people discussing this in abstraction.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:27):**  And then when they finally get out of the office, they go, oh, this is a problem.  I saw that with animal welfare 20 years ago when I worked with McDonald's.  And I remember executives that are coming out of the office and they saw some bad things.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:39):**  And they go, oh, this isn't just something to relegate or give it to the lawyers or the  PR department.  We've got some problems here that we need to fix.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:48):**  But they didn't realize that until they saw it.  Not just reading about it, not just seeing something on a spreadsheet, but actually seeing.  And we've got power equipment that's falling apart.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:11:58):**  We've got all kinds of problems.  I think you're hitting a good issue there, Temple, that for a long time, we just thought  about all these things as abstractions, especially our food system.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:12:11):**  There hasn't been a lot of thought in the last two generations about how food gets to  the grocery store.  You go ask most young people today how does food show up at the grocery store.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:12:21):**  Well, it just comes on a truck.  Yeah, but the truck has to get it somewhere.  And the thing is I'm an ag and so I can visualize the whole entire supply chain.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:12:30):**  I see it.  It's not abstract.  This brings up another thing that I'm getting very concerned about now in education is visual  
**[0:12:39-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:12:39):**  thinkers like me can't do algebra, but you need us in engineering so we don't make a  mess like failing to put watertight doors on Fukushima because when you calculate risk,  you don't see the water flooding the electrically driven emergency cooling pump.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:12:54):**  Or you just simply don't put the emergency diesel generators below sea level in the basement  of a building.  And if you do, you put watertight doors in because it's actually a second Fukushima plant.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:04):**  I've been on its website and they now have very elaborate waterproof doors and the seawall  is double the height.  But you see, I can see a risk like water flooding sites.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:15):**  Mathematicians calculated it and they did it right for the shaking for the earthquake  Fukushima held.  It was fine after the shaking.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:22):**  It won its grant.  It was.  They just looked at just part of the system and the effects of a catastrophe on just part  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:28):**  of an system.  Well, they looked at the shaking, but they didn't.  They tried to look at it in isolation and didn't take a more holistic perspective of  
**[0:13:36-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:36):**  what are the rest of the systems effects going to be if X happened?  Well, I can see water flooding the site, regular industrial doors are going to just bust out  and two seconds later, the basement's full of water and it's electrically driven pump  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:49):**  that you need really, really badly is not going to work.  It doesn't matter how many generators.  Hopefully they've learned some.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:13:55):**  Because if it's underwater, I mean, then you couldn't even work on it without pumping  the water out of the basement.  And then all the roads were blocked.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:02):**  I mean, I'm just saying the math.  You see, I see the stuff.  It's not abstract.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:08):**  They, I think part of the problem is with a lot of people in charge of stuff, it's all  abstract.  It's just spreadsheets and stuff like that.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:16):**  And you've got electrical wires falling off the towers in California because they never  maintained anything.  So when the wind goes 40 miles an hour, they got to turn off the power.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:23):**  You got to be kidding.  Yeah.  We got to turn off the power because we didn't maintain our infrastructure.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:29):**  So you guys have to live in a blackout and we're going to get our buddies in the legislature  to pass a law that says we're not liable for damages.  And your insurance company will pay for it.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:38):**  What happened in Texas, right?  Weren't people without power for like nine days and it was totally unwarranted.  Do you know that story?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:46):**  Well the problem is, and I've, you know, I just pieced together what I read in the paper  and is that you had four different types of power that broke.  You had wind power, it was 20% of the power.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:14:57):**  You had gas fired plant and you had a coal fired plant and the nuclear power plants froze.  Now your easiest ones to winterize is where the stuff that froze is on the site.  Windmills, you know, this distributed system, they didn't buy the winterized version.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:12):**  That's going to be hard to fix.  And if they get too much ice on the blades, you have to turn them off because they get  wrecked spinning like a washing machine off balance.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:21):**  How developed.  That would wreck the windmill.  That would absolutely wreck it.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:26):**  There's a couple of cool videos on YouTube of flaming windmills because of out of balance  blades.  Well, I've been a break it.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:32):**  You know, and you know, like if you washing machine, I can break the washing machine.  If you don't stop it went severely out of balance.  Yeah, I've done that.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:40):**  So you've actually busted one.  Yeah.  I'm not the smartest one.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:45):**  And some of the power plants that froze up, their cooling water ponds froze up all the  way down to the intakes and they couldn't intake any cooling water.  You know, and gas supply lines, natural gas supply lines froze because you know, the raw  
**[0:15:59-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:15:59):**  gas coming out of the field still had enough moisture in it to freeze in the extreme cold.  This is the thing where you have to find out.  I see then you have all the massive different people own these.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:13):**  But the first thing is to find out exactly what froze, which is oftentimes difficult.  You know, what actually froze.  And I've been around enough on industrial that the way to find out is you go visit the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:26):**  site, and you get talking to the guys who actually worked on the equipment and you get  them off by themselves and you get away from the managers and they'll tell you, they'll  show it to you.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:34):**  They most likely already knew the answer before you even showed up.  They already know the answer.  They knew the answer.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:38):**  They knew what was gonna happen.  You just had to break down the barrier.  So they were in a safe place to actually give those answers, right?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:45):**  Well, I've done that.  I've done that with some things.  And yeah.  
**[0:16:50-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:16:50):**  And then when I write up my report, I don't say where I found it out.  But I mean, you get a guy that's head of maintenance and you get him off by himself and you know  you're gonna protect him and not reveal the source.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:17:01):**  They'll take it right out there, show you whatever it is, why it broke, how it fixed.  Then they'll tell you how stupid the suits are.  There needs to be more of listening to these people that are working hands on.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:17:13):**  Also, we're not replacing people that work hands on because a lot of the visual thinkers  like me that are really good at that can't be algebra.  And they've taken all the shop classes out of the schools and factories and all kinds  
**[0:17:26-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:17:26):**  of industrial stuff are having a horrible time hiring people that can fix stuff because  the kids that can fix stuff, well, they got an autism label or dyslexia label and never  had a chance to do any hands on classes.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:17:40):**  It is a connection back to your education because the people I work with in my career,  they've retired.  And I worked with people that were autistic, dyslexic.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:17:49):**  I know two people that are autistic that own metal fabrication companies and they have  20 patents a piece.  And they started out as small, small little guy innovators.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:00):**  It's little guys do the innovation and the guys that think differently.  So Temple, one of the things I really want to talk about today that I've had several  people reach out to me on social media over the last week or so and they're very concerned  
**[0:18:15-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:15):**  about is this PAWS ballot initiative that's going around in Colorado.  And since you're in Colorado and you're obviously very well spoken and very intelligent, break  it down real fast.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:27):**  What is the PAWS Act and why is it going to ruin agriculture in Colorado if it passes?  Well, you've got one thing in it where an animal has to be five years old before you  can get a product from it.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:38):**  Oh, you're kidding.  Well, there you go, start milking way before age five.  You're usually almost done, right?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:44):**  Well, that's right.  And some of this stuff, you wouldn't be able to say dogs and cats eat.  It's going to be a lot of unintended bad consequences.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:18:54):**  You wouldn't be able to control the population of dogs and cats if you follow some of these.  I'm very concerned that we're getting people making policy now that are totally removed  from all things practical.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:05):**  It's too much abstraction.  And I don't think people that wrote that wanted to stop you from saying dogs and cats.  You wouldn't be able to help a cow calf, there's a thing about sexual abuse of an animal.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:16):**  Well, the way it's written, if a cow paid as a cow for pregnancy testing or had to reach  up inside an animal to help it have a baby, that would violate that law.  That's ridiculous.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:28):**  Wild.  I'm really concerned and I think one of the base things is we're getting everybody removed  from the practical.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:37):**  In my class on livestock handling for years, I've had the students do a scale of drawing.  And I've found in the last five or six years, they're having more and more and more difficulty  doing the scale of drawing.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:48):**  And I had a student in my class this year who had never used a ruler in her entire life  to measure.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:19:55):**  How do you make it to college?  I think it's a real concern.  How do you make it to college without having to use a ruler or a measuring tape?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:01):**  Well, is it the age of the iPhone?  Is that why?  Well, it's just all the age of tech, but this particular student had never used a ruler  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:08):**  to measure anything.  And then they'd ask, why would you ever want to learn how to make a scale drawing?  I said, well, let's say you want to remodel your house.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:16):**  You might want to make a scale drawing or you want to make sure the couch you're going  to buy is going to fit in your living room.  Let's just talk about those kind of basics.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:23):**  And they kind of go, oh, I hadn't thought of that.  That's a good skill to have of making a scale drawing.  I always take a tape measure with me when I go furniture shopping now, because it has  
**[0:20:35-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:35):**  to fit perfectly or else I'm not going to buy it.  Well, you're doing the smart thing because my sister lives in New York and she was on  the board for her apartment and she says there's some innovative people in New York that became  
**[0:20:46-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:46):**  the couch doctors because people buy a couch that won't fit in the elevator.  And then you call the couch doctors, cut it up, put it in the elevator, take it up to  your apartment and re-enact it.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:56):**  Put it back together.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:20:59):**  That is actual real business.  I've also moved a lot, so that's why too.  Trial and error for me.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:21:06):**  But this is where some innovative entrepreneur, talk about little guy innovating, coming up  with a business where he could capitalize on people's inability to measure the elevator  before they bought a couch.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:21:19):**  Exactly.  So back to the PAWS Act.  How can people fight that?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:21:25):**  I mean, what can we do besides raising awareness?  Well, what we need to be doing is people that are doing really innovative things in ranching  need to be reaching out to the public and showing how they're improving land.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:21:36):**  A lot of people just believe that livestock just wrecked the land.  But if you use them right, you can improve the land.  This is something most people don't realize.  
**[0:21:45-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:21:45):**  We've got to start communicating it, showing that the animals are part of the land.  I had kind of a big wake up call about three years ago.  We had a seminar where they invited an agronomist in to talk to animal science and the agronomist  
**[0:22:00-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:00):**  explained how our best land for crops in Iowa and Illinois was created by fruit grazing  bison.  Now if you do grazing right, you can actually improve the soil health.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:12):**  That's something that we should be doing.  If you just keep piling up the land and doing monoculture, that wrecks soil health.  Monoculture makes a lot of money in the short run.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:22):**  It wrecks everything in the long run.  It strip mines all the health out of the land.  That's the problem.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:27):**  You lose your topsoil and then you end up using synthetic fertility to grow crops in  basically a substrate.  Well that's the problem.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:35):**  But if you were to rotate crops and then maybe every third or fourth year you had a cover  crop, then you put some livestock grazing on it.  If you've got to graze a cover crop to make it pay, you would be improving the soil health.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:45):**  You did it right.  By adding...  Very, very local.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:48):**  By adding natural fertility and natural biology back to the soil.  That's right.  That's what you would do.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:22:56):**  And the animals are part of the land.  We're going to have to get much more integrated things.  And the big monoculture, it makes a bunch of money in the short run, but it doesn't  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:09):**  work in the long run.  There's good ranchers out there doing a lot of things to improve habitat for wildlife,  to improve a lot of things.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:17):**  And we need to make the public a lot more aware of it.  I agree.  I work with a lot of ranchers in different states.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:24):**  And I will say my most profitable ones and the ones that actually have better mental  health as well are my regenerative ranchers who understand soil health as a foundational  principle.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:36):**  Well, and it's been interesting watching this evolve because I've been getting that grass  farmer newspaper for years.  And now, 20 years ago that was looked at like sort of alternative, really kind of crazy.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:47):**  And now, thank goodness.  Witchcraft and voodoo.  Yeah, snake oil.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:23:50):**  Now, it's becoming much more mainstream.  But this is how a lot of things that are considered totally far out become mainstream.  And then there is some stuff that's far out that is just rubbish.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:04):**  But there's other stuff.  And I think of the probiotics in the chickens.  And as I went up the escalator at that big food show, I was kind of laughing going, 20  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:12):**  years ago, they stuck their nose up.  Now they're hanging gigantic banners all over the trade show.  Now when I talk about that, I see it.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:19):**  I see it.  Yeah.  There have been a lot of changing attitudes.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:23):**  You know, I'm in my early 40s.  So I haven't been around near as long as you have Temple, but I've definitely seen the  switch from, you know, the high stress rammer jammer cowboy types to the lower stress.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:34):**  Right.  You know, low stress handling techniques and better designed facilities.  In fact, handling is improved.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:43):**  That's the thing that's improved.  That is really good.  But another thing I'm concerned about in animal husbandry is pushing an animal's biology.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:24:51):**  I think on some things we've just gone too far on that.  We're having more problems with grain fed beef with a late stage dead a week before  he's supposed to be processed, rolled over and died.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:03):**  That used to not happen.  What's causing that?  Pushing biology to the point where it's just kind of overloading the system.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:09):**  You just start looking at optimal, not max.  The chicken industry actually has fixed their problems, but they still have problems.  Are we feeding too hot of a ration for too long and making them grow too fast and they're  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:21):**  metabolic and structural?  Well, there's actually four things.  You have heavier at a younger age.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:27):**  Okay.  Too much grain is another one.  Another one is genetic.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:31):**  So you're breeding for meat and there's some heart problems they're getting.  There is definitely genetic impact of that.  Leg confirmation issues, then they get lame and then too many growth from them.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:40):**  Well, there's four things that would contribute to pushing biology too hard.  Now, what I have found on this, at least in beef, is most feedlots don't do this, but  unfortunately there's a significant minority, I'm going to say 15 or 20%, that are pushing  
**[0:25:56-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:25:56):**  cattle too hard and they've got tons of liver abscesses, heart problems, and they bring  this stuff in on the night shift.  But it's not the whole industry.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:05):**  I want to make that very clear.  It's what I'm going to call a significant minority.  I mean, it's not just two or three percent where they're just feeding 95% grain, no,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:14):**  frankly, no roughage, and just pushing the animals to the point where their biology doesn't  throw like breaking the bridge.  That they've got to harvest them a week before their liver fails or their spleen breaks down  
**[0:26:25-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:25):**  or their lung lesions kill them.  Well, Paige, the big problem is lung lesions.  But it's looking at what's awesome, you know, pushing the biology, the pushing of a system  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:36):**  can sneak up on you and you may not realize.  That happened with lameness and dairy cows.  This is very well documented in the science literature.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:43):**  We got up to 25% before farmers realized there was a problem.  And three studies showed that if you ask the farmer what percent of your dairy cows are  lame, they'll underestimate by half, three scientific papers on that, then you start  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:26:57):**  to measure it.  Bad.  You know, this is really bad.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:00):**  This is what I call bad becoming normal.  Very easy for it.  They slowly creep up on you and you kind of don't really, don't.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:06):**  I think I just read an article within the last day or two that almost 98% of the dairy  cattle walking around right now, I mean Holstein breed can trace, have semen from one of two  bulls.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:19):**  Oh, six breeds, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:22):**  Like, you know, and we're talking about, you know, lineages, breeding and feeding, and  we're kind of dancing around, you know, epigenetics and how, how breeding and feeding through  the ages and feeding, you know, forages that these animals haven't been long term.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:34):**  The problem they're having with the dairy cow, and this is very well documented in the  literature and I've documented a lot of the stuff in my book, improving animal welfare  practical approach.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:42):**  I've looked all these studies up and put them in there.  Is the breeding of the dairy cows getting more and more different?  I kind of like to look at, at an animal sort of energy budget and the budget of how all  
**[0:27:55-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:27:55):**  physiology works sort of like a national budget.  So if that cow was a country, if I put the whole national budget into milk production,  or if I want to breed just for milk production, then I'm going to shortchange infrastructure,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:28:07):**  which will be skeleton, that's lameness and fertility, that's repro.  I may also shortchange my military, which is immune function and fighting disease.  Nothing free in this world.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:28:18):**  All of this stuff takes energy.  Going back to the evolution of the leaf to make the more circuitous, you know, path of  veins, it takes more energy to build that, but plants evolved to a distributed supply  
**[0:28:32-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:28:32):**  chain for a reason because it's less likely to be disruptive.  Great stuff.  The problem that we get is we get into these, these problems where it creeps up slowly and  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:28:43):**  then you finally will like, there's a problem.  Right.  And it takes a long time to change those, right?  
**[0:28:50-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:28:50):**  Well, there's dairies right now that are doing crossbreeding.  You know, they'll, you know, pre-hosting cows to Angus, get crossbred beef cattle.  That's good.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:00):**  And then things, but dairy cows being used, but then he didn't start doing that.  Yeah.  It always got into trouble.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:07):**  There's several dairies around me, small kind of artisan grass fed dairies.  There's one that they've developed their own dairy cow that works perfect on their farm.  They just call it the Jaco breed, but the, the other two that I'm thinking of, they all  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:22):**  use Jersey cows.  And I tell you, I'd rather have grass milk from a Jersey cow.  Their components.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:28):**  Oh, grass milk from a Jersey cow, even raw milk from a grass Jersey cow days before all  I want to drink, you know, vitamin whole milk out of the group.  The idea is, is, is consumers don't know that.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:41):**  So they, so, so consumers think volume, right?  So you're buying a gallon of milk, right?  And a lot of it times it's like 1% and I always laugh and like never buy 1% milk.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:29:52):**  You're just paying for water.  But, but it's, it's, they're buying decisions.  They don't realize that the quality is, is not to offend any Holstein breeders or growers,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:00):**  but it doesn't have those components for, for, for taste.  Right.  So yeah,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:06):**  There's always a price.  And the thing is we do have a lot of, you know, people that are low income people and  they study it.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:13):**  True.  And, and but there's a point where you overload a system and it breaks and supply chain broke.  People really thought the first time and not just include, but other products too, and  
**[0:30:27-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:27):**  going, whoa, maybe this isn't such a good idea.  You know, and with a port, that was the worst.  I mean, took 300,000 head of pigs and you just killed them on the farm and throw them  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:35):**  away.  That was atrocious.  Heartbreaking.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:38):**  I couldn't imagine being that contract pig farmer.  No, it would be terrible for the pig farm.  Just terrible mental health issues.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:45):**  Some of the methods you still them weren't bad, but you know, the whole thing was just  really bad.  And the problem with big is it's fragile.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:30:55):**  It doesn't matter whether it's electrical distribution system or it's a pig farms or  it's a semiconductors for your car or pharmaceuticals, which is common generic drugs that are essential.  Big is fragile.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:10):**  And now I just, now I'm seeing a picture on the front page of the Wall Street Journal  of the huge container ship stuck on an angle.  I'm going to be interested to find out how to get it out.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:19):**  I'll definitely want to see that because I'm a very visual person.  Well, I can see the picture because I got the paper this morning and I looked at it  and I'm going, they sure have a problem.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:30):**  Maybe a ship that big shouldn't even go through that canal.  I don't know.  It's the ship I was on.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:36):**  I was on an aircraft carrier and I don't know the specs on the one that's grounded, but  you know, I was on aircraft carrier that was dang near a quarter mile long and we were  166 feet wide at the waterline.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:48):**  Flight deck was 250 feet wide and there were several parts going through the canal that  you could walk.  You could go to one edge of the flight deck and look down and see dirt and then walk to  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:31:58):**  the other side of the ship and look down and see dirt.  The ship was overhanging the shore on both sides.  What canal were you going through?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:06):**  Suez.  That was the Suez Canal.  The Suez?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:09):**  Yeah, I think they've widened it through those parts since then.  That was on the first transit that I went through, which would have been 1998.  Yeah, I see the problem is this ship is jammed in a 45 degree angle.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:24):**  Yeah, I saw that.  This morning I haven't looked at any other thing about it, but then it said how many  containers you put on it and then I'm thinking about another article I read where some humongous,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:36):**  gigantic container ship and the problem is if something goes wrong with that, you mess  up five ships worth of shipment and people will be getting to realize that maybe that's  a bad idea to have a container ship.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:45):**  Or like we saw a year and a half ago with the big fire out at the Tyson plant at Holcomb,  Kansas.  That's right.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:32:53):**  That's not that big of a plant considering the scale of the harvest, but percentage wise,  that was a major disruption.  Well, it was.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:02):**  It was the rest of a disruption and pig disruption, like COVID, pig wars, but it definitely was  a disruption and the problem is the fire got started in the cardboard box storage from  the one place that was burned and it damaged the pre-stressed concrete and root.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:18):**  What giant beams they had to take out of their place.  My brother-in-law caught part of the electrical work to rewire that place.  Oh, he did?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:26):**  Yeah, he said it was all hands on deck.  Tyson does not care what it costs.  Wow.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:32):**  Get it running now.  So they took everybody off of every electrical job.  They were building a jail up in Northwest Kansas.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:38):**  They pulled everybody off.  They even got some union guys to come in and they just, they slammed everybody they could  find into that Tyson plant and they weren't the only.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:47):**  So he was doing electrical work.  If someone had to do a lot of structural work before they did the electrical.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:53):**  It was, he said it was all going on at the same time.  Wow.  As much as it possibly could be.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:33:59):**  And but we've got, but when they build our new chemistry building, five years ago, I  talked to Tina who was the head of that project and she told me that they were short on electricians.  They just, people weren't going into the trade.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:11):**  You know, that's a real essential skill.  Go to college though.  Get a degree.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:15):**  I think that was a.  Electrician's gonna have a job and, and we're going to, and the people in my generation  are retiring and we're going to need people to, you know, fix stuff and build stuff.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:26):**  We've got bridges that are falling apart.  I'm never forget a bridge of soil, sort of call outside of Chicago where all the reinforcing  steel was showing and they had plates and tables wrapped around it.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:37):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you'll look at it and you'll, that's terrifying.  And then 10,000 people walk by and drive by on city buses and don't even look at it.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:48):**  Well, I noticed it and the only reason I didn't take a picture of it because it was on my  phone or going by.  Otherwise I wouldn't take a picture of the car, but I'm going, this is like terrible.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:34:58):**  And then these are things, but it doesn't matter what it's ag or whether it's other  infrastructure.  We're going to need people to fix stuff.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:04):**  And I kind of mind the object visualizer.  These kids are sort of getting shunted in the special ed department and they never get  a chance to take shop or take ag.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:14):**  We need to make sure we keep our FFA classes in the school.  Got to make sure we keep that.  Really important.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:19):**  Very important.  You know, we're, we see the loss of that.  I remember, I can remember seeing things that say that, you know, back in the 1950s and  
**[0:35:27-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:27):**  a high school graduate could pretty much, you know, walk out and walk into an apprenticeship  if they, you know, like an auto repair shop or at an air conditioning place or at TV repair.  Well, there were courses in high school that started preparing people for careers in the  
**[0:35:46-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:46):**  trades.  And if you couldn't find a trade you wanted to go into, that's when you went to college  and somehow we got all that messed up.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:35:55):**  So how do we go back?  These are good jobs, really good jobs that are not going to go away.  That's the thing.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:02):**  So how do we go back?  We need to be, and things like working on the regenerative agriculture.  One of the things we need to be doing is writing about those examples of that that really work  
**[0:36:12-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:12):**  and writing about it.  Because one thing I did when I first started my career back in the 70s, I designed some  new cattle handling system I wrote about.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:21):**  And we need to be writing about, particularly innovative, both getting it out to the public  but also getting it into the academic scientific journals too.  We need to be doing both, getting it to both places that we can show how if we use livestock  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:34):**  right we can improve life.  That's one of the things we need to be teaching.  Temple, I got to tell a little story real quick.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:40):**  So you just mentioned your work in the early 70s out there in Arizona.  And my really, my close friend, he lives, his ranch is just about three miles up river  from mine.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:51):**  And sadly, he's had to sell and he's moving.  His father was one of the guys that worked at TNC feedlot.  TNC feed yard.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:36:59):**  Which feed yard?  TNC is what he said.  Oh, TNC.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:02):**  Well, yeah, that's in Maricopa.  That was in Maricopa.  Yep.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:06):**  He said his dad was one of the guys that worked at TNC and he remembers you being there.  Ed said he was all about eight at the time, but he said he remembers you getting down  on your hands and knees and going through, going through facilities and going through  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:19):**  stuff.  I did that.  I still have old pictures I think I took at that feed yard.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:23):**  So, Ed Bricker senior, if you recall the name, if not, I remember that name.  That's awesome.  It's kind of a small world sometimes.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:32):**  Yep.  That's right.  His son is my best friend and closest neighbor.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:37):**  Like I said, unfortunately they're, they're getting ready to relocate, but I've enjoyed  having him as a friend while he's here.  That was, that was the neat story that he told me this morning.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:45):**  I just thought I'd throw that out there.  Oh, great.  Well, thank you for passing that on to me.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:50):**  Appreciate it.  That's great.  So, circling back to the PAWS Act, like how, how can we fight that?  
**[0:37:56-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:37:56):**  Like what can we do besides doing a better job of telling our story in regenerative ag  and his lifestyle?  Well, we're going to just be divided on specific, specific things and, and I think talk about  
**[0:38:07-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:07):**  a lot of the unintended bad content.  There's an awful lot of things where you have people that get way too abstract, make, make  legislation and do stuff that doesn't.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:17):**  We're going to have more and more problems.  And as someone who's worked on, you know, designing slaughter plants and things like  this, one thing that's gotten me interested in regenerative agriculture is learning about  
**[0:38:26-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:26):**  how we can use, you know, animals to actually, you know, improve land and do something that's  very, very sustainable.  Sustainability is going to get more and more important.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:36):**  And we need to look at some of these supply chains for, okay, some, okay, let's say when  somebody wants to do almond milk, well, that's not sustainable.  Almonds take up huge amounts of water.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:47):**  Huge amount.  No, it's not.  Oh, but trees are good though, right?  
**[0:38:51-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:38:51):**  Well, you can do things with trees where you overdo it.  I think with biofuels, a certain amount of biofuels in moderation is sustainable.  But then I read about something and I thought it was just crazy.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:02):**  Actually put it in my book on improving animal welfare practical approach where they cut  trees down the Southeast of the United States, chop them all up into pellets, put them on  a boat, ship them over the UK and burn them in a PowerPoint.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:14):**  There's no way that that's sustainable.  That's biofuels gone crazy.  You see biofuels in moderation, you know, can be really good.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:21):**  People see the thing is, where do you stop?  Transporting a shipload of wood waste to Europe to burn in a power plant.  Like wouldn't we have just been better off to take the fuel from the ship and burn it  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:34):**  in the power plant instead?  Well, that's right.  I couldn't believe, you know, I looked that up, found out that I'm going, you've got to  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:40):**  be kidding.  The world's.  And then various things I've read about, about biofuels.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:45):**  I've been down to Brazil where you go miles and miles and miles past nothing but sugarcane  for biofuels.  But biofuels are green.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:52):**  A certain amount of that, a certain amount of that is sustainable.  And then there's a point where it gets unsustainable.  They don't see where to stop.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:39:59):**  I think the problem with sustainability is, you know, sustainability kind of predicates  the idea that where we're at is okay and we just want to stay here.  And I don't accept that.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:11):**  I don't accept that the current state of the world of, of spaceship earth is acceptable.  And I want to work very hard to generate it back to a better place.  That's right.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:22):**  That is right.  And we've got to be thanking them.  Now it's going to be the small people that are going to do it.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:27):**  You know, a lot of people are interested in cultured meats.  They're interested in, you know, burgers made with vegetable stuff.  Well, you look at the ingredients, you've got a lot of different stuff that you're putting  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:37):**  in that.  Each one of those things has a supply chain.  Has it actually been looked at, see what the energy requirements and stuff are to get all  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:44):**  the different ingredients that you need?  Exactly.  Because I'm seeing it.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:48):**  I'm seeing it.  You've got to grow it.  I remember I was on some trip and we were talking about a country in Central America  
**[0:40:56-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:40:56):**  where they were growing some ingredients for some herbal remedy where it wasn't sustainable.  I read the other day about feeding seaweed cattle to reduce methane, but now I can see  somebody out there strip mining the oceans of seaweed.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:10):**  That would not be sustainable.  Let's destroy an ecosystem in the ocean that other creatures are dependent on to feed it  to cows.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:19):**  No, that is definitely, definitely, definitely.  To balance their emissions from eating corn.  Like what, let's just stop feeding them grain in the first place.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:26):**  There's things where we've got, there's a lot of things, but what we need to be doing  is I think on a lot of things, looking at a lot of the things that innovators are doing  and you also need to write about it and talk about it.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:37):**  You know, people ask me, well, how did I manage to have a big effect on improving cattle?  I wrote them and I wrote about it a whole lot and I just wrote how to artists about  the flight zone, point of balance, how to design a, put a drawing of the facility in  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:50):**  the art.  Now I see things written up in the Softman Grass Farmer, but that's a fairly limited  audience.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:41:56):**  Really good paper.  I get it, but it goes to a limited audience.  It's not available online.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:00):**  I get it too.  It's a terrific resource and one of my favorite things to do, whatever I get it is read Joel  Salatin's column on the front page.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:08):**  Yeah, I read those things too.  And I've been out to, I've been out to Polyface Farm and he's growing an amazing amount of  food off that one.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:17):**  Well, I'm going to have to go in a few minutes.  Great talking to you.  Temple, it's been short, but I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us today.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:27):**  Is there anything we left on the table?  I think we pretty well talked about a whole lot of things.  Another thing, I've done a lot of work on animal welfare guidelines.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:36):**  You have to have clear, simple guidelines.  You can't say things like handle them proper.  What does that mean?  
**[0:42:42-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:42):**  Like if I'm running a supply chain and I've consulted with a lot of people that are supply  chain managers, I have to have very clear things that are not acceptable in my supply  chain and it has to be written very clearly.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:42:55):**  So if I take them off the approved supplier list and they want to sue me, I've got very  clear language on what's absolutely not acceptable to do if you are a supplier for this company.  Clear guidelines.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:09):**  And the tendency a lot of times, and I find verbal thinkers over generalize, say, well,  something like handle them properly or give them an appropriate amount of space.  Well, I don't know what that means.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:17):**  You've got to have clear guidance.  Also, the tendency now is to go with outcome measures.  I designed the original American Meat Institute system for scoring a slaughter plant.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:29):**  Outcome measures, like how many animals fall during handling.  That's something that's very easy to measure.  And then I can tell if it's getting better or getting worse in measure, but going with  
**[0:43:38-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:38):**  outcome measures.  Well, of course, on regenerative agriculture, soil health would be an outcome measure.  You need to have a place to evaluate projections.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:45):**  But clear, really clear guidance is when I talk about these measures, I see it.  Like I'll see a lame cow.  Basic animal welfare, body condition of cows, lameness, swollen knee joint, sturdiness.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:43:56):**  These are things that I can measure.  I can tell that am I getting better?  Am I getting worse?  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:02):**  Really simple things that you measure.  My dad always likes to say, if you don't measure, you can't manage.  It doesn't exist.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:08):**  That's true.  And then sometimes if you use the wrong metrics, then you might put the wrong incentive into  it.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:15):**  And that can get a problem.  That's great.  Before we go, I know CK had something that she really wanted to get out.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:19):**  So CK, it's all you.  I just, I know you've been in this game a long time, but when you started, did you feel  like you got a lot of criticism from the beginning and how did you handle that?  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:30):**  Well, being a woman was the biggest barrier I had.  And I made myself really good at what I do, what I did.  I also found back doors to things.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:38):**  There was a scene in an HBO movie of Temple Frandon where I go up to the editor of the  Farm magazine, the Geddish card, because I knew if I wrote for that next, that would  help my career.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:48):**  And then I started covering meetings and I got a reputation for writing really good,  accurate articles.  I'd summarize the speech at the meeting.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:44:55):**  It'd be accurate.  And so writing skills were important in my career and a lot of young students today,  their writing skills are terrible, absolutely terrible.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:03):**  Because if I had not produced a decent article, the summary of a master's thesis, working  on cattle, we shoot some cattle handling, they wouldn't have published it.  But I also saw places where there were back doors and where I had most of my troubles  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:17):**  was with the foreman level of management.  It wasn't the owners of the feed yard.  It was the foreman where I had the trouble.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:23):**  And I had to make myself really good.  I was twice as good as a guy.  And there were people that helped me.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:29):**  There was a contractor who saw my abilities and he was a former Marine Corps captain.  He seeked me out to design projects for him to build.  He was just starting a small construction company.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:41):**  He was a very helpful mentor.  There were some people that helped like Jim, the contractor, there was my science teacher  when I was in high school.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:48):**  There was Ann out at the ranch.  I was still visiting her.  People like that were really, really helpful mentors.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:54):**  I cannot emphasize the importance of mentoring.  It's just so important.  Thank you.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:45:59):**  Really important.  Well, thanks for that temple.  Okay.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:02):**  Well, I think we've probably talked about, you know, more of the stuff.  Running out of time.  Yeah.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:06):**  Running out of time.  And the other thing, I'll tell you one other thing.  When I first started, here's a mistake I made in my 20s and 70s.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:11):**  I thought I could build a self managing cattle handling.  A lot of engineers make that mistake.  They can solve a problem totally with technology.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:18):**  No, I can solve a lot of things with technology, but I also have to have management.  I have to have the management.  And when we worked on the McDonald's animal welfare audit, out of 75 suppliers, only three  
**[0:46:29-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:29):**  had to buy expensive equipment.  Everything else we fixed with a lot of maintenance and management and things like non-supploring,  adding a light, an illuminated chute.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:39):**  Most of the places didn't have to build a whole lot of equipment.  It was making them repair and fix and manage the stuff they had for the most part.  There were three places out of 75 that had to do some very expensive renovation of the  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:51):**  whole front end.  It's like, I'm going to interrupt this whole latch down this chain.  Get rid of that mirror, get rid of that shiny thing.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:46:57):**  Well, we did a lot of that.  We also did a lot of management things, like teaching people basic flight zone and point  of balance principle, not to yell at cattle and not to constantly hit the side of the  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:08):**  chute.  I'll have people say, well, Temple Grandin just talks about the same old thing, but I  find that I have to.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:14):**  And then when that student says, I talk about the same old stuff, gets out in the field  for three years, then they find out why I'm still talking about some of the same old things.  It's just like traffic.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:22):**  Police are still have to be out there enforcing the speed limit.  They can never stop enforcing.  Now handling's gotten better.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:31):**  There's some surveys that are showing that maybe something like yelling and screaming  at cattle.  Now 70% of the people don't do it, but you still have 30 or 20 or 30% that's yelling  
**[0:47:41-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:41):**  and screaming at cattle.  You still have to keep talking about things.  Those are the guys that get sent home at noon with full days paid and we finish without  
**[0:47:49-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:49):**  them and don't get called back.  You've got to still have to talk about basics and management.  Well, it's been really good talking to you.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:47:58):**  Temple, we really appreciate your time today.  I'm going to have to catch this other phone call that's coming in right now.  Okay.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:48:03):**  Thank you for joining us today, Temple, and have a wonderful day.  I will.  Thank you so much.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:48:07):**  Okay.  Bye.  What an amazing conversation with an amazing lady.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:48:11):**  I know that was a shorter show than normal, but I think it was well worth it.  Very information packed.  Great pleasure to speak with Temple.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/6--Temple-Grandin-Big-is-Fragile-eth921#t=0:48:21):**  I hope the guests that we had lined up to release don't mind being bumped a couple of  weeks.  I think they won't mind being bumped for Miss Grandin.

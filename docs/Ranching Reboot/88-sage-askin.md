### Ranching Reboot  (2022-10-31)  
### Author(s): Red Hills Rancher  

**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:00:00):**  Hey gang, welcome back. This episode sponsored by C90 Ocean Minerals, nature's most complete trace  mineral salt and the one I feed to my herd. Support for this episode also provided by our generous  patrons on patreon.com forward slash red hills rancher. This week my good friend from Lusk,  
**[0:00:15-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:00:15):**  Wyoming, Mr. Sage Askin joins me from his field office via zoom for a long overdue conversation  about how to get started in ranching with nothing but a dream. Sage shares his tips and tricks  about how to get on the same page with ownership about long-term land management goals.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:00:32):**  All right, gotta pay some bills. If you haven't heard about Anchor by Spotify,  it's the easiest way to make a podcast with everything you need all in one place.  Let me explain. Anchor has all the tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast right  
**[0:00:44-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:00:44):**  from your phone or your computer. When hosting on Anchor, you can distribute your podcast on  listening platforms such as Spotify, Apple Podcast, Google and more and it's super easy.  It's everything you need to make a podcast in one place and best of all, Anchor is totally free.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:00:59):**  Download the Anchor app or go to anchor.fm to get started today.  Mr. Askin, welcome back to Ranching Reboot. How are you today?  I'm wonderful. How about you, Brian? Oh, it's just another day in paradise. You haven't,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:01:27):**  you don't have a spare rain shower you could loan me, do you?  No, we're a little short on those ourselves, but I'll sure pray one comes your way and maybe,  maybe, maybe starts out here and heads down there. Well, that'd be awful nice. That doesn't happen  
**[0:01:42-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:01:42):**  very often. No, well, when it does, it's usually something like, you know, a horrible snow or ice  storm and you can keep all those. All right, right. So, since we did this last time, what was  it back in January? I think episode 40 something maybe. Why don't you, I've picked up a few new  
**[0:02:04-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:02:04):**  listeners and you're back by listener requests. So, who are you, Guy? Well, thank you. I'm deeply  honored to join you again, Brian. I had such a good time down there that day and we had a great  day running around your ranch. Love what I saw there. We need to do it again. We will do it  
**[0:02:23-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:02:23):**  again, for sure, for sure. I'll come when you get some rain. I want to see it when it's really,  really green. I'd like to see it really, really green again. So, for all the new listeners of the  podcast, why don't you just give us the quick squirt of who you are, where you're at. Perfect.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:02:38):**  So, my name is Sage Askin and I ranch with my wife, Faith, and our three little kids,  Alpharetta, Clancy, and Gus. And we are located in extreme East Central Wyoming. And we have  multiple units. I guess probably what most people are interested in is that we've been super blessed  
**[0:02:57-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:02:57):**  with the opportunity to start up from scratch. I just had a dream of starting a ranch and we  operate primarily on leased land and we operate now at a fairly decent scale. And we are investing  in land and we have livestock investment and we're just having a lot of fun making a living.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:03:16):**  And most of what I have to talk about is probably my mistakes. But we're just loving the lifestyle.  And what else? Specifics, we operate three different units that are all kind of work  together, but they all work on their own too. We all work as a team for the HR and the personnel,  
**[0:03:37-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:03:37):**  but we don't help each other very often back and forth. They kind of work on their own  labor-wise. And we're trying to get that all functional and that should give us some ecological  diversity and some ability to withstand some of these drought events like you and I have been  
**[0:03:53-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:03:53):**  talking about. And also, we're just trying to pioneer kind of a new model of ranching is the  way I look at it, Brian. And I look at it as, what our measure of success would be is, we've come up  with a kind of a new mission this year and it's making the family ranch viable. And we're really  
**[0:04:11-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:04:11):**  excited about that. And we're doing that by trying to make our family ranch viable. And what I mean  by viable, because that requires a definition, is we're able to invest in land and be happy to do  that with after tax dollars profit and pay ourselves a sustainable wage and pay fair market  
**[0:04:30-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:04:30):**  value lease for everything that we operate on and make an economic profit while doing so. And that  is the ranching for profit definition to that. Oh, you got to hit your dinger. We're trying to  do that. So anyway, you can take it from there, Brian, and go where you want. So yeah. Well,  
**[0:04:50-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:04:50):**  you surprised me. I wasn't ready for that RFP name drop, but we got her in there. Got to get a few of  those. Got to get a few of those in. Haven't had too many of those in lately. Yeah. So you gave me  a lot of good rabbits to trace. A lot of people have been asking some of these questions.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:05:09):**  We've talked about drought planning and you're in Wyoming. And part of good drought planning is  having the ability to flex your stocking rate, paying attention to the weather situation,  the forecast and the long term climate prediction models and seeing what's coming down the line. If  
**[0:05:26-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:05:26):**  things say it's going to be dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, maybe you need to get rid of some of your own  units. So you have some, say you have some forage for what you keep to eat. Can you talk a little  bit about that? Are you keeping any, and I'm kind of also interested in if you're keeping any cows  
**[0:05:46-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:05:46):**  over the winter and how you're planning on keeping them fed and supplemented? Sure. Yes. That's a  great question. So we lease a lot more land than we need for our own livestock. And I think that  that's a good rule of thumb. I mean, so have more land based than you have animals to eat.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:06:03):**  For sure. Like, because that's when you back yourself in the corner, and it's the 10th of  December on the last sale of the year. And you're like, I've got to sell these. And you just take  what you can get right. And then you take that hit. That's how you go broke is back on the  
**[0:06:15-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:06:15):**  is backing yourself in a corner financially, and being at the whim of the market, which we can't  control the other thing we can't control. So back to the drought planning. Um, we do exactly like  you said, we spend a lot of time, I don't put a lot of faith in long term weather forecasting.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:06:32):**  I mean, I'd love to find one that seems accurate. And they're not there. I mean, I don't know how  you agree with that or not. But they just, you know, they can give you agree. Yeah, I mean, I  spend a ton of time thinking about what happens this week. Because those seem pretty good now.  
**[0:06:48-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:06:48):**  And certainly better than they were five years ago, 10 years ago, we've had our, you know,  we've been really saved by a good meteorologist up here. His name is Don day. He gives a great  podcast, we watch it. And he will call a storm that he balances like three different models,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:07:04):**  you know, the North American, the Canadian and the, the is it the European or whatever.  And, and that's different. A lot of our weather stuff here in the US, like active weather and  whatever, they just go off the American model and they stink, to be honest, it isn't always right.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:07:18):**  And he'll often say, you know, here's the and then he has lots of experience. So he brings a  lot of analog stuff in with it. And and that helps us avoid storm events. However, in long term  drought forecasting, we're thinking about a few things right now. One is like, I doubt that we're  
**[0:07:34-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:07:34):**  going to have a quadruple DFLA Nina, right? It's probable that we're not basic. I think we're  gonna have a triple though. Yeah, it's been a triple. It's been a triple on India, and there's  only been three or four of those, you know, we're probably not going to have next summer should go  
**[0:07:50-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:07:50):**  at least in so neutral, right? Or something like that. And I don't know, is that what  days talking about? I haven't listened to him lately. That's what Don day is talking about  is saying like, it looks like probability of going neutral. So back to what we use it in our deal is  
**[0:08:06-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:08:06):**  I just a general idea. So I can't stock up till the grass grows. I can't, I can't grow grass  until it rains. So I can't really do much. So we have, we try to match, we're pretty good at  forecasting what our winter stockpile is going to be in dormancy, because we can go measure that  
**[0:08:23-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:08:23):**  it's pretty real time. We don't have a lot of oxidation loss and things in the wintertime.  When do you go measure your winter stockpile? Yeah, here right at the first of like November  is pretty good. Brian, we've reached and then we're generally going to err in our favor. Like  
**[0:08:37-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:08:37):**  if we get any growth, it might be in like the draws and stuff. Sometimes it does happen.  The little cool season grass that's down the low draws or where, you know, yeah, done by water. I  get a lot of that through the wintertime. If I get moisture, if you get moisture, and we do too, way  
**[0:08:53-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:08:53):**  more than you're told in college, you know, but I feel like, you know, if we measure it then and we  say this is what we've got, we're not going to bank on any more, and we're probably not going to have  a fire that burns any of it up where we're at, you know, I know that that's a risk where you're at.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:09:07):**  So that is pretty good. And we just came up this morning, what are you going to do if we  get a fire that burns up the hay pile? Oh man, take them to town. Yeah, it might be worth it stirring  the hay, you know, that's a good point. Yeah, it might be a good risk management. I'm looking at  
**[0:09:27-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:09:27):**  buying crappy alfalfa for way too expensive. You might be able to insure it for more, I don't know.  That's not a terrible idea. You know, I'm not buying forage, I'm just buying supplement.  Yep, yep, yep. Well, but anyway, yeah, that's, so I always go an extra month too. So we tend  
**[0:09:48-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:09:48):**  to think of green grass May 1, and we've every year where we live at Lusk, we've been able to  have green grass to graze on May 1. But I will tell you, March and April are the most difficult  times of the year on a cow that I can imagine. I mean, there'll be little bits of grass coming up.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:10:04):**  Now sheep, it's another reason to have sheep, they do really well that time of year. We're not  worried. So we'll stop supplementing the sheep in mid-March, almost irregardless, other than in storm  events. But the cattle often they can't just get quantity enough, and they'll actually expend more  
**[0:10:19-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:10:19):**  energy chasing green grass. And if they're like a short-term cow or something that could be  compromised in any manner, that's when I worry about cows. So we actually will kind of skimp on  the early part of winter, especially if we're open, and we'll be ready to supplement during  
**[0:10:33-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:10:33):**  storm events or right before, so we're not out in the storm event. And then going on in the winter  time, we put an extra month's worth of feed in and budget clear to the first of June, right,  you know, on this November 1st feed budget. And that's what we say we're going to winter.  
**[0:10:46-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:10:46):**  Anything that we come up, so I have a pretty good idea right now, I'm talking to you  on October 11th, I have a pretty good idea where we're at. And I'll solidify that, you know,  and we'll go ahead and move like whether we have to get extra winter feed or something or winter  
**[0:11:00-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:11:00):**  forage or something. I try very hard to move the cows to winter forage if we need to. Last year,  we did some corn stalks to help augment keeping our cow-calf deal together. And that's not  something I try to do. But it's something we do if we think we're short, you know, so.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:11:17):**  Okay, the question I really want you to answer is how much forage hay do you go through in a year?  Like how many days a year are you hauling a ration your cows versus just a supplement?  Yes, Brian, for the last five years, we have not unless it's like, so on the range cows,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:11:37):**  that's what you're talking, right? I mean, ranching, ranching, our production livestock,  we're way under half a ton of cow for the whole winter of hay use. So we just don't,  we just don't do it. So you're feeding, if you're a half a ton, that's 1000 pounds for a cow,  
**[0:11:55-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:11:55):**  divide that out by 30 pounds a day. So you're not even feeding 30, 40 days. That's right, Brian,  we're doing a lot of I think similar to what you've done. We're doing a lot of surge feeding  where we might feed twice a week. Or we might we do use some cubes sometimes for supplement,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:12:11):**  but it's even that is pretty low consumption. I'd have to do the math. But like we might be feeding  a pound at the most of the last five years, we've been feeding a pound per day. And we might start  that after the first of January. And we're only doing it, you know, once or twice a week. And then  
**[0:12:28-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:12:28):**  we're doing that until unless we got snowed up. And then we might feed, you know, eight pounds  of hay, you know, and again, we're only doing that once or twice a week, we're doing a big surge feed,  you know, with hay, especially, we've had pretty good luck doing twice a week. And we've had a  
**[0:12:41-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:12:41):**  little bit of luck going, you know, once every other I'm sorry, once a week, or doing like a  huge gangbusters feed, like doubling up once, you know, every other week type of deal, and then doing  with those being like in front of weather events or right, right. You know, when you get into the  
**[0:12:59-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:12:59):**  regular weather events or semi regular in late, late December, January, February, we'll do a lot  of that where we're surging them enough with hay for weather events. And then we're, we're doing  cubes when it's open. And that works great, you know, it seems to work great. But total winter  
**[0:13:14-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:13:14):**  feed costs are less than $100. And I try to keep it there even in those these high input times. And  that really helps us stay profitable. It really scares me seeing guys that are saying they're out  of grass already. And I've been talking about this on social media now for like six weeks,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:13:33):**  like six weeks ago, it was, so you already gave it away. I mean, recording October 11th. It was  the first of September, I saw some neighbors feeding hay. Like, and I'm in southern Kansas,  like if you're feeding hay in southern Kansas, first September, you got a problem. And, you know,  
**[0:13:53-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:13:53):**  even people farther south down into Oklahoma, southeast, you know, southeast Oklahoma,  northern Texas, I've got reports of guys already feeding hay and been feeding hay for a month,  month and a half. Like, that's just absolutely insane. See, it was last week, one of my one of  
**[0:14:11-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:14:11):**  the folks on my Discord server said that they were bailing up corn stalks in central Kansas,  and western Kansas feedlot had offered them $150 a ton for baled corn stalks picked up.  Like they were gonna come. Yeah. So that goes into another thing. And I don't know if you want  
**[0:14:32-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:14:32):**  to talk about it. But where my mind goes, is the market implications. A lot of people are betting  on a really bullish cattle cycle right now. And I just think that the inputs are going to take all  the starch out of that. You know, I do want to talk about that. I really do want to talk about  
**[0:14:49-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:14:49):**  the market implications of high feed costs. But where I'd like to focus on first is, you know,  since you're a guy that has done what I think a lot of my listeners want to do,  bootstrap up from nothing. Let's spend a little bit of time talking about that.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:15:10):**  Sure. So you said that I think one of the earliest times that I heard your name was at that school  that shall not be named, or maybe at a workshop. And your mention is, you know, starting on leased  land with leased equipment, and leased cattle. So I guess that could be a good, if that's a  
**[0:15:35-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:15:35):**  good starting point for you. How does say, well, I'll look at my demographics and analytics page.  I got a lot of listeners in Houston. So let's just say somebody's in a filing cabinet in Houston,  in an office job that they hate, and they want to be the next Sage Askin CEO of Askin Global  
**[0:15:52-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:15:52):**  Land and Livestock. What would be step one? Well, the key to it is that it is just a margin  business. And you do not need a lot of operating capital, if you can get out of your head. So step  one is a psychological change of saying, I don't need to own the cow, and I don't need to own the  
**[0:16:13-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:16:13):**  land. And if you can break those are huge paradigms, as you know, Brian, if you can break  those paradigms, I would say the sky's the limit, there's never been more opportunity than right  now. The third thing is distinctly getting that first piece of land. I would look at for, you  
**[0:16:31-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:16:31):**  know, in an urban environment or more urban than where I'm at, just unused land, vacant land, you  know, and I know it exists in tremendous volume. Further east in the United States you go, it  exists more and more. I mean, just find something that you can add value to with your livestock.  
**[0:16:49-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:16:49):**  And that's where it really starts to work. But in the West, I would say it's more competitive,  because we are valuing land for grazing value. It's something we see. So you've got to more  explore the underused, so the underserved land, the stuff that hasn't had water developed,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:17:07):**  the stuff that, you know, the CRP is a huge thing that I think a person could make a sustainable  grazing business on today, as we speak, because they're encouraging you now, more and more to  use that every third year, they understand like, wow, this sucks if we don't use it every now and  
**[0:17:26-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:17:26):**  then. And they're right, you know, and so that's a huge, somebody should start a grazing business  that puts together thousands of acres of CRP and does that like right away. I think that's a huge,  you know, they can graze it every third year, they could just make arrangements with those landlords  
**[0:17:42-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:17:42):**  and pay a fair market rental rate and things that work. So tying up the land is key. And I think it  doesn't have to be a huge scale. Once you've broken the paradigm of not having to buy the cows,  and you just focus on the land, I think it's pretty easy. I don't think it's that hard to  
**[0:17:58-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:17:58):**  come up with a piece of property. And then the next thing is what do you run on that piece of  property? And that is strictly a margin thing. And I think you can, you know your costs into  the property. And if you don't know those costs, you can ascertain that off of forage production.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:18:15):**  And if the and you can go to the NRCS and come up with a production per acre on that,  that's a reasonable assessment. You can compare and cross reference that with what is the price,  I'm sorry, what has been like past use, historical use or nearby use. I think those are good things  
**[0:18:32-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:18:32):**  to cross reference. Never plan on like a grazing, like year one out of the gate, I'm going to get  double just because I'm going to do management intensive grazing. I think that'd be a poor  practice and nobody would tell you to do that. Don't plan on growing the grass until you've  
**[0:18:46-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:18:46):**  grown the grass. I think that's a fallacy that people like, oh, but those are Jared guys,  they just say if you just move your cows four times a day, you'll have double the grass.  Right? Well, that's a gross oversimplification of a lot of shit that I've said.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:19:02):**  You know, is is there grains of truth in there? 100%? Does it take time? Yes. And that's what  they're not mentioning is it's not an overnight change. And I think similarly, and maybe this is  worth talking about, as a rabbit trailer chase is overgrazing and drought. Like the more pasture  
**[0:19:27-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:19:27):**  gets overgrazed and continuously overgrazed in a dry climate, the farther it's going to degrade,  and the longer it's going to take to to to restore that. Right? Totally, totally.  And, you know, the reason for that is, so you're in the dormant season, I'm not afraid to graze  
**[0:19:50-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:19:50):**  short. Because when you graze it short during the growing season, those plants are going to go,  oh crap, I got to throw up some solar panels. So they're going to sacrifice root mass. Okay,  that root mass is going to die back to give the plant energy to put up solar panel because that's  
**[0:20:08-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:20:08):**  an act of desperation. Like, hey, I got to throw up another solar panel because they're all gone.  I got to catch some energy and store some sugar in my roots. So maybe I can put up a stem and seed  head. And, you know, a set stock pasture that gets, you know, continuously grazed, as soon as  
**[0:20:23-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:20:23):**  that solar panel gets up there, somebody's going to come by and clip it off. And what's the plant  do? The plant does the only thing that it can do according to its programming and its genetic code.  It sacrifices more root mass to put up another solar panel. You sacrifice enough of that root  
**[0:20:40-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:20:40):**  mass long enough, you know, when your roots are dying back, your fungal networks get stressed,  your bacteria get stressed. You know, your soil microbiome isn't doing its job because  it's all stressed. And it's not stressed because of lack of water. It's stressed because it's  
**[0:21:01-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:21:01):**  sacrificing everything it has to try to put biomass back above ground. And then when it does rain,  if you overgrazed it too bad and all your roots have died, then when it does rain, there's no  moisture infiltration. There's no life in the soil to help soak that moisture down.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:21:23):**  And it all runs off and goes down the creek. And it's like, I mean, I can see it in my head how  everything may have happened, you know, in West Texas and New Mexico and Arizona. Well, even here  and, you know, into over in eastern Colorado. Now, we just overgrazed shit out for five or 10 years  
**[0:21:43-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:21:43):**  and a couple bad droughts and it just never had enough management to recover.  Yeah, and I see it all over, you know, you see the preponderance of those more rhizomatous grasses  there or the real salt-bound grasses that are everywhere. That's not what was there. And that's  
**[0:22:00-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:22:00):**  what's there now, you know, and that's because of that. And I think it's been longer than five or 10  years. I think it's been sporadic good management over 150 years. And then most of the time, 90%  has been turn them out, you know, and I think you can get away with it in people's lifespans  
**[0:22:19-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:22:19):**  because some of the changes happen slowly.  And you can graze, you can kick them out all summer at like half of the stocking rate at a very low  stock. I see this a lot on ranch land where we're at. And that's okay under their economic model  
**[0:22:42-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:22:42):**  because it got paid for under the last economic cycle. It's not being paid for now. In fact, it's  being used to subsidize a lifestyle now on so many ranches. And because of that, they can kick  out and do that. And that land continues to go, but it's just a slow gradual degradation that  
**[0:23:00-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:23:00):**  happens over the 30 and 40 year span, where 30 and 40 years go by right now, people, almost  everybody, I would say as a rule, if you talk to them about how many cows to grandpa run, they  might say, double, they might say a third more, they might say, and and but there's a lack of  
**[0:23:17-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:23:17):**  understanding of how they got there, you know, and it isn't all met just by cow socks, if you really  do the math, it had to do with management in some in some of the other markets, you know,  and we're dealing with degraded rangelands, you know, that's exactly right. And so yeah,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:23:33):**  in drought management, back to the original question, I think you have to leave adequate  residual behind. And like you say, I don't mind grazing short in the wintertime either in dormancy.  In fact, I think that that stimulates growth. We have messed up, Brian, there's been times when  
**[0:23:47-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:23:47):**  we've grazed in the in the grazing season. You know, we've done the Ian Mitchell Innis.  We really love that style of top 30, you know, and we've done the top 30, you know,  that style of top third grazing, and I have messed it up where I've went, and I didn't get any precip  
**[0:24:03-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:24:03):**  on it. And it doesn't recover in that growing season. And you just have to lengthen your  recovery season and say, okay, not going back. So we've got some pastures right now, some paddocks,  they're very small paddocks. That's the other benefit. When you do that, you're doing it on a  
**[0:24:15-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:24:15):**  paddock system, you're doing on point 5% of the whole ranch and you're like, Okay, I did mess that  up. That's my bad. But but I'm, I'm dang sure gonna make sure that recovers before I come back,  you know, and the smaller your paddocks are, the less you have to worry about screwing up because  
**[0:24:32-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:24:32):**  it's a lot easier to screw up. That's not a lot easier to screw up. It's, it's less taxing to  screw up one acre out of 500 than it is to screw up 250 out of that 500 with a management practice.  And that's, I really hope that that folks would understand that, you know, you don't have to take  
**[0:24:54-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:24:54):**  your whole ranch, or your whole farm and do regenerative and soil health stuff on it. Right?  Just start somewhere. I mean, start, you know, so you got a 40 that's back there behind the tree row  that nobody from the highway can see, go do something weird back there. You got a back  
**[0:25:10-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:25:10):**  pasture that's a little bit inaccessible that you can't really use any other way. Well, or, you  know, that's this kind of isolated by roads. Well, figure out how to use it, do something, try  something, you know, because if we just, if everybody keeps doing what they've been doing  
**[0:25:26-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:25:26):**  the last 30, 40 years in this business, like train wreck doesn't even describe it.  I think we're headed there. And again, we're not going to touch that till you want to but,  we'll do that in the last half of the podcast. Yeah. But no, I mean, no, that's just it. I think  
**[0:25:48-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:25:48):**  you've got to chase this stuff. It is in the arid west, west of the 100th meridian. It is,  you are going to have to do a leap of faith if you're going to go into grazing management and say  like, because you're not going to get instant gratification. East of the 100th meridian,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:26:01):**  you can get instant gratification in some seasons, you know, you can graze it in May. And by July,  you're like, wow, this is so good, you know, it feels good. And, and, and I don't think you can  get that west of there. But it's hard for me to take somebody seriously that's in a 60 inch  
**[0:26:19-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:26:19):**  rainfall environment that says we haven't had rain in five days, or we haven't had rain in 12 days,  we're in a drought. Like, right. It's really hard for me to take you serious right now.  It is hard, but it's legitimate to you know, those guys when they turn into that it's possibly more  
**[0:26:34-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:26:34):**  devastating. I mean, their plants aren't activated. They're just not used to it. So when it happens,  it really happens, you know. Oh, yeah. And I get that I don't want to take anything away from this  just right. It's hard for me to take you seriously when you get 60 inches of rain, and it hasn't  
**[0:26:49-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:26:49):**  rained in two weeks, you're telling me you're in a drought. And I'm like, looking at 32% of my,  of what would be normal for the last rolling 12 months, like, right. Okay. Yeah, you probably  had more rain last month than I've had in a year. Right, right. No, that's just it. That's just it.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:27:09):**  Yeah. And so a lot of this stuff, what I have noticed, Brian, we're coming in, we're through  the third summer of drought, pretty severe drought that happened after three or four really good  years, you know, to be honest, and we did a lot of soil building in those three or four good years  
**[0:27:23-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:27:23):**  on one ranch specifically, that we we had done some really good practices, we broke it out into  paddocks to about 40 paddocks there. And that ranch in this drought, we are de stocked, maybe  to 55% of what we consider to be our carrying capacity on the other ranch land that we got,  
**[0:27:42-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:27:42):**  like in 2020, as we were entering the drought, the ranch land up there, we only had to de stock 15 to  20%. And we have in every year of this drought actually had additional forage, including this  year where we said, Hey, we can do something else with that, if we want to. And that is the benefits  
**[0:28:02-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:28:02):**  of this regenerative ag, it comes later. And we've built that and it sustained itself through this  drought. And I feel like that particular ranch is going to bounce back extremely quickly when we get  into precip. And so we saw it this year, we manage land two miles away from that. And that though,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:28:17):**  and they suffered the same drought, the same heat index days. And we would it did feel like we got  a little more rain up there. But the numbers don't back it up, we didn't get more rain there.  It just made better use of the water that we did get. And in these drought stress, you get just  
**[0:28:36-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:28:36):**  like we were talking before the show about maybe 1500s, but under good management, that can go a  long ways, you know, it makes use of hopefully 70% of that gets used in some manner or all of it,  if you're doing well.  
**[0:28:49-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:28:49):**  Yeah, so hypothetically, an overgrazed pasture that's, you know, the grass is less than an  inch tall, which is, you know, probably a lot of ground between where I'm sitting and where you're  sitting, I'd say that's probably 95% of land between us right now is less than an inch tall,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:29:06):**  or it's farm ground, but that doesn't really count. And so 1500s of rain is what, let's just  talk that it's 1500s of rain, or real heavy dew. When I've got knee high stockpile, and knee high  grass and forage still into pasture that I move out of, you know, all that moisture gets a chance  
**[0:29:29-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:29:29):**  to get down there to ground level, and it's shaded from the sun. So the sun comes out today, it's 80  degrees, and it's 12% humidity with 20 mile an hour wind. Am I going to lose that moisture at  ground level, at soil level, because of the biomass that I left on top of the soil? Am I  
**[0:29:51-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:29:51):**  going to lose that faster or slower than the neighbor whose grass is an inch tall?  Yeah, much slower. I mean, their whole deal on 1500s is going to be evaporation and gone,  you know, volatilization immediately. They need, that's when you run into country that needs like a  
**[0:30:08-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:30:08):**  two inch precip event to even start to turn around. And it'll come, a lot of this country,  it comes in the wintertime, and you eventually get a big snow on it, and it turns around. But  I agree completely, Brian, this is the future. And I would go so far as to say that economically,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:30:26):**  in 30 years, this will be parity. Everybody will be trying to chase their tail doing some  sort of management intensive grazing. And I think it's caused by land values. I think you  can't afford not to. You've got to do better with what you have. You think it'll be 30 years?  
**[0:30:44-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:30:44):**  It might be shorter. Yeah. But I hope it's shorter.  In Ag, everything happens by generations. And I know that we're exiting a generation right now.  But I still think there's a lot of hangers on. I think it'll be a lot longer timeframe than it  
**[0:31:01-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:31:01):**  should be.  I hope you're wrong. I mean, yeah, you're absolutely right. You know,  we do have an entire generation looking to get out right now. And maybe that's more true in  
**[0:31:16-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:31:16):**  some areas than others. But you know, we've talked about it before on the podcast. I can't remember  if it was you or not. But you know, average age. I've been doing this since 2006. And since then,  average age has done nothing but go up. Like, you know, so 16 years, how far has it gone up?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:31:35):**  I think it's gone up by six or eight years. So it's like half the time that I've been here, we  haven't had the turnover rate that we need. And it's very interesting. You know, we talked about  grazing value versus land price. And you know, west of the hundredth meridian, or you know,  
**[0:31:55-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:31:55):**  I-35 for lack of something better. You know, things are really different. I'm at 98 west.  So I'm not that far from 100. And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  You know, I'd probably rather be on the other side of it, because it's a lot more consistent  
**[0:32:11-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:32:11):**  rainfall, you know, larger, you know, consistently larger population density,  better access to markets. And so I watched a YouTube video about this. And I think I've  said this before, but 80% of the population of America either lives on the Pacific coast,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:32:31):**  or east of the hundredth meridian. 80%. So there's only 20% of us out here that live in the  middle for western half of the country, excluding the Pacific coast. 20% of us. And you take out  like Denver, Phoenix, Vegas, Salt Lake, and Albuquerque. And we're not far away from single  
**[0:32:53-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:32:53):**  digits being in that whole area. And that's pretty wild. So and land price gets really weird  on the east side of that line. You know, because it rains a lot. They grow crops,  especially where they have soil. And you know, you're saying grazing value and land price. And  
**[0:33:20-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:33:20):**  here in my area, land price has been disconnected from grazing value for at least 15 years. Like  I haven't been able to pencil a scenario in 15 years with land prices the way they are,  that it makes sense to go try to buy a ranch with cows. That doesn't pencil here. Does it? But  
**[0:33:42-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:33:42):**  would that still pencil there? Or have you even tried?  No. Oh yeah, I've tried. Of course, I live and breathe that. It feels like, and I try it all  the time. Pretty much everything that's ever come up for sale, I've at least glanced at  
**[0:33:56-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:33:56):**  in 15 years. And none of it. So what would be the old rule of thumb? Or I'm not going to say  I'm not going to say the word. But the rule of thumb that you and I have been taught  was three to four times the value of a cow would be a good little deal per au on a on a on a ranch.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:34:14):**  So if it's a 300 cow ranch, and the cows worth 1500 bucks, it'd be 1.8 million, maybe that you  could pay for that ranch. Well, go and try to find a 300 cow ranch for 1.8 million. They're not out  there. I mean, now, they might be out there, you can make it that like you and I can make it that  
**[0:34:33-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:34:33):**  through management, maybe what was 100 cow ranch, it might become that, but not without significant  capital investment. And it might have been 100 cow ranch when grandpa had it. But now it's a  50 cow ranch because it's full of trees. And it's been overgrazed. And the price tag is $3,500 an  
**[0:34:55-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:34:55):**  acre because it's being marketed as a recreational property for deer hunting versus agricultural  value. So somebody will come in and buy that land that's already degraded production value is is  very low pay way more than production value from the livestock ranch that you or I would be running  
**[0:35:15-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:35:15):**  literally next door. They'll overpay for it. Never take care of their trees. Never take care  of their grass. Never take care of fences. I mean, obviously, this is worst case scenario. They're  not all that bad. I hope not take care of their trees, allow their trees to spread and just  
**[0:35:36-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:35:36):**  generally not be a great neighbor and brag about the, you know, brag about the deer that they're  not shooting, or brag about the deer they're seeing and whatever. To them, it's a game,  it's an investment. It doesn't matter to them that they're paying twice what any of us could  
**[0:35:54-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:35:54):**  afford for the same piece of property. And they're not making money on it. And they just look at it  like, well, that it's 160 acres, why do I care about that $2,500 tax bill? Well, it might not  be a big deal to you, fella. But when you paid that when you overpaid for that parcel of land,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:36:12):**  you drove my taxes up on my big parcel because I'm trying to make a living here.  Sure. Yeah, 100%. And that's just the difference in value. They have a value. And like you were  starting to say, you know, the productive value hasn't been valued on rangeland in the West for  
**[0:36:32-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:36:32):**  15 years or so. And I wonder if some of that might not be about to change, but we can hold that  thought. Yeah. So let's circle back. You talked about, you know, going to NRCS and getting the  USDA production estimates. Yep. And so let's talk about that. Let's, and without throwing around,  
**[0:36:57-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:36:57):**  like specific numbers. So how grounded in reality have you found those USDA production estimates  versus the reality when you take over a property that has been managed not as well as you're  managing it for sure. I've felt them to be the best starting point that I can do, but I always  
**[0:37:19-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:37:19):**  cross reference it with past use, or just a reality check. So I do two parallel scenarios on a  spreadsheet. And I do to come up with a stocking rate. And I actually do, I actually kind of do  three. So I'm going to talk about all three and I'll throw them at you. So the first thing I do  
**[0:37:36-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:37:36):**  is I try to use the NRCS, but all I try to get is based off soil pipes, they have three different  vegetative productivities that will come up on a web soil survey. One is a poor year, basically,  one is a moderate or average that is the average. And that's, that's a good average. And then the  
**[0:37:54-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:37:54):**  other is the high production year, you know, and that's going to be out out leaders on both the  poor and the high. That's what that's picking up as big outliers. And those are that tells you  something that if those are pretty close to the same numbers, then that ranch actually has pretty  
**[0:38:10-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:38:10):**  variable precipitation is what that tells me. And that's actually a pretty good ranch. Like I start  to look at that. And if those numbers aren't very far apart, all I all I'm looking at is not so much  at the number, it's this is a good ranch, this thing doesn't move a lot in forage production,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:38:25):**  it's going to be pretty easy for me to depend on. If those are wildly different, and I see them all  the time, there might be three times the value of the high value to the low value. I think to  myself, I'm going to be challenged to match the stock rate to the available carrying capacity on  
**[0:38:43-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:38:43):**  any given year on this ranch doesn't mean we won't look at it, but it's just something to file away.  So I do one based off pounds of forage produced. And that's it. And I'll run, I'll run all three  of those scenarios on that one just to get the range. And I just leave it as a range.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:38:58):**  The second one I do is what did grandpa do? What does dad do? And what do you do, you know, and  a lot of ranches we look at, they'll say, Oh, yeah, we're running 250 cows. And I try to tease  that information out, what it did do what they and most people have a rule of thumb. Most ranchers  
**[0:39:15-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:39:15):**  have something and they might say, Yeah, it takes 30 acres to run a cow. They might end the same  token, you go to a different part of the world, they might say, four acres to run a cow, two acres  to run a cow. We like that, right? Like we like rules. And so so that's a good number. Like go  
**[0:39:29-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:39:29):**  ahead and run that as a parallel analysis. That doesn't mean it's gospel. But starting point.  Yeah, yeah, as a starting point, both of these are just starting points. And and you'll find  they'll start honing in on stuff. Usually the NRCS data will be more optimistic, that I would argue,  
**[0:39:46-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:39:46):**  Brian, that that doesn't make it bad data. That means that it is working off soil, like the NRCS  hasn't had money for soil samples for 30 years, for new samples, like other than on crop land and  things. And so a lot of that data is good. That is the capacity and the productive capability of that  
**[0:40:06-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:40:06):**  land, then it's been mismanaged for another generation. So so it can do that. It sure isn't  doing that today. And we've found that a lot of that will wake up in two or three years of decent,  you know, average or above average precipitation, it can change there really quick and meet that.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:40:21):**  But but I agree with you that I don't I don't see that. But anyway, to finish the assessment,  I do that. And then I like to do the neighbor assessment a little bit, if you can tease that  out. I don't always say that neighbors is gospel truth. But there's some good things as you and  
**[0:40:37-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:40:37):**  out you and I know about looking at it, it's always easier to look over the fence and see  some things. There's going to be a few things there that are really positive. So if I can  put those things down... It's always easier to tell somebody else what your neighbor's doing wrong,  
**[0:40:51-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:40:51):**  versus what you are doing wrong, because I'm not doing anything wrong. Oh, my my my stuff's great.  Exactly. But that neighbor over there, man, if he if, man, if, oh, those cows are too big,  or you know, if he just put them all in one herd. Yep. Yeah. And in the West, the other metric you  
**[0:41:09-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:41:09):**  have to put against it, if somebody says that they're wintering, or I think this is true all  across the nation, actually, sadly, um, but then you have to pinpoint their stocking rate. They're  like, Oh, yeah, we're running for inner cows, you have to pinpoint the number of cow days,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:41:23):**  they're being fed, you know, full feed. And and most people are grazing for about six to nine  months, and then the rest of the time, they're feeding their cows. That's probably the average,  I would say, and stuff that we look at, um, in the West. That's okay. You just have to make sure  
**[0:41:40-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:41:40):**  that becomes a math problem. We just change it to correlate and then say, Okay, well, really,  if you were grazing out, we would be grazing 200 cows, not 300. And oh, yeah, probably never done  that. So I don't really know, you know, and that that that's the rule, rather than the exception.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:41:54):**  Oh, well, we can't we can't scale back to 200 cows from 300. So we wouldn't have to feed all winter,  because we wouldn't make any money doing that. Like, doesn't seem like you're gonna make a whole  lot of money putting $5 a hay day at a cow right now. Oh, my gosh, no, no, sir. Yeah. So that's  
**[0:42:14-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:42:14):**  that's how we come up with a stocking rate. That's the whole goal. That whole exercise is to come up  with a stocking rate. And that value is something that we found interchanges between ecotypes and  states all across the West. It is only a freight that I would argue that the difference is the cost  
**[0:42:33-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:42:33):**  of freight in what that's worth. So let me use an example. If you were up at Wilbur's place,  Northern Montana, okay. And you're looking at a place where you're at the difference in the  actual intrinsic cost of that pasture. My average, I don't know, a buck 15 per cow per day, or  
**[0:42:53-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:42:53):**  something, I don't know, because it's a lot less where he's at, because it's a freight basis away  from where you're at. So if you're getting a buck 50, he might be getting 90 cents, and I don't  know, that's just a generality. What I'm saying is it should all come out to about freight. And so  
**[0:43:08-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:43:08):**  if you have pounds of production, you know that 1000 pound cows going to eat around 26 pounds of  dry matter per head per day. And you can do that math wherever you are in the world. And and kind  of figure that out, you know, and obviously, there's local things and local niches, and you  
**[0:43:24-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:43:24):**  try to become aware of those. But to get a baseline average and put a value on a piece of land, it's  100 acres, and it produces 30,000 pounds, you can do the math, and you can say this is how many  animal unit months, standard animal unit months I can get off of that. And then you can divide that  
**[0:43:39-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:43:39):**  by 30.16 and get the number of standard animal unit days and boom, you have the you have a value.  That's all it is, you know, so so it's not that hard. I think you've just got to break it into  pieces and segregate it and make it scientific. And then it becomes something and and you can  
**[0:43:55-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:43:55):**  put a value on it. And I think on the value the dollar in roughly $1 per cow day, if you just  think of that, you know, and you're doing the work that would get you a lease and that's fair.  That's market, you know, and then there's all sorts of variables, mark variables being who does  
**[0:44:12-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:44:12):**  the work, right? Who does the work and who makes the decisions? There's the two variables. And so,  and timing of use, I guess that'd be the other one. And so, so does a landowner need to keep it  out of grazing for something like they got a wedding next summer, or they need to hunt in for  
**[0:44:27-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:44:27):**  two months in the fall? Like, okay, well, then take those out, you know, that's okay, take out  that part of the value, then you can figure out what you can do with the rest of the season and  just average it. So I think it's pretty simple math, and we've used that with great effect,  
**[0:44:42-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:44:42):**  you know. And so how we do that often, we figure out who owns it, we map it out on web soil survey  on we do Google Earth, you can change the Google Earth becomes a KML or KMZ file, you use a shape  file converter, convert to shapefile, you plug it into web soil survey, I do that all myself. And  
**[0:45:00-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:45:00):**  that saves me 1000s of dollars per hour of work that I would have to hire somebody ArcGIS to do.  Like, it's all public data, I can do it all for free, you know, or for the use of my time,  you know, and it believe me, it pays us back 1000s of dollars per hour for me doing that. So  
**[0:45:17-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:45:17):**  yeah, I'll, you know, this year, I'd like to say that, you know, I go to the ranch to spend money,  and I come back to the office to make money. Sure. You know, if I don't go out there, I don't spend,  I spend less money. And it seems like I can sit down here and I can make more money than  
**[0:45:34-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:45:34):**  the well, I try to make more money than I can spend out there. But it doesn't seem to be  always turn out that way. I want you to talk about where you're at what you're doing today real quick.  So you're sitting on the side of the road. Yeah. And where yet?  
**[0:45:54-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:45:54):**  I am in East, well, far western Nebraska. And I'm, oh, I've got some pasture cattle  that were steers that didn't make the bus and I'm running them back to the owner. Just kind of a  typical deal in the fall when we run several thousand head of stockers for somebody. So  
**[0:46:09-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:46:09):**  there's always a couple that'll miss round up. I get it. But I just kind of wanted to point out  that, you know, you're so busy. Like you planned to pull over to the side of the interstate,  and get out your hotspot and your laptop and talk to me for two hours in the middle of hauling cows.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:46:25):**  I think that's pretty cool. I just wanted to make sure that that the listeners knew about that.  Well, it is important to mention that my time is really scheduled. I was not willing to agree  with you. And you wouldn't have been either to do this on like a Sunday morning, because  
**[0:46:40-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:46:40):**  because I've learned the value of time. And, and, and that is my family time. So I'm totally  willing to do this and break it out on the schedule during the week. You know, I love to think  we we do a little bit of exaggerated bankers hours. So we work pretty hard when it's nice.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:46:55):**  But half of that is given back to us in lifestyle, because we're out where we want to be. We want to  be outside when it's nice, because we only get that six months out of the year. But believe me,  in the wintertime, I'm in an office and, and not driving the nasty roads. I'm having a great time  
**[0:47:11-0:47:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:47:11):**  in the office doing really productive time. So that's something a lot of people, I've learned  that from the school. And I am sure you have to all of us workaholics have a hard time,  wrapping our heads around that, I think. But when we have families, suddenly the importance of that  
**[0:47:29-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:47:29):**  becomes tenfold. And most of my wealth is in my family. And that's the truth. And so that's really  where I need to be devoting a lot more time.  I think the real wealth, a lot of my wealth is in relationships, relationships, you know,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:47:45):**  with family with, you know, with some of the folks that I've met, they're doing this podcast  that I've interviewed that listen and reach out. I think that's, that's where a lot of value is for  me is, is relationships and be able to make stuff happen.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:47:59):**  100%.  So something else I want you to get into. I've been taking notes. Tell me about this TV show  that that you got conned into doing. Tell me about that.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:48:13):**  Well, about two years ago, Dallas Mount was approached by somebody, and I do not know who,  but I think with NEL, or at least RFP alumni who said, Hey, there's a TV show called Going  From Broke, and it is produced by Ashton Kutcher. And it's kind of a fun thing. And so there was a  
**[0:48:37-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:48:37):**  casting company who was casting for that. So Dallas just thought, well, I'm going to do this.  So Dallas just thought it was funny. And he more or less, I think. And so he passed that on to  Faith and I. So we did a short, I believe it was like a three minute video, like on your phone,  
**[0:48:52-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:48:52):**  Brian. And send it in.  Like an audition type thing.  Yeah. Well, you answer a few questions, mainly just talk about yourselves. And that's it,  
**[0:49:00-0:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:49:00):**  you know, kind of kind of animated.  They see if you're photogenic and interesting and have a story that they're wanting to tell.  Totally, totally. Yeah. And I never would have guessed we were any of those, to be honest,  
**[0:49:12-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:49:12):**  but we sent that in. Didn't hear anything back, except for we did finally kind of get a denial,  like you're not going to fit on the show. Okay, cool. Well, that was season two. That was in 2021.  They called us this spring and they actually said, Hey, we want you to recast. Like,  
**[0:49:30-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:49:30):**  can you audition for this again? And we said, well, sure, I guess. I mean, we didn't,  we just moved on with our lives. And they said, well, Ashton himself really wanted you back on  the show. We didn't have enough slots last year. They said, you really should do this. I think  
**[0:49:45-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:49:45):**  you're going to get on it. And so we're like, okay, well, I guess we'll, we'll apply for this  show. And so, so we did. And the show is about, it started out as a concept about the student  loan crisis. And the first couple of seasons are pretty heavily on that. It's a bad problem  
**[0:50:02-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:50:02):**  in the United States. It with free money. Like when I was in school, I could just sign up for  as much as I wanted on any given weekend to do whatever I wanted with. And, and it took a pretty  astute individual who was not myself to resist that alert. You know what I didn't go. Yeah. And  
**[0:50:21-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:50:21):**  I saw that happening even like, even right after I was getting out of the military after bootcamp  while I was in the military, I was seeing that happen. And then especially after I got out in  mid two thousands, like, you know, in 2006, like, wait a minute, you're making money  
**[0:50:40-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:50:40):**  going to school and not working. Yeah. Yeah. I got, I get these grants and I get these student  loans and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. How much debt are you going to graduate with?  Oh, it shouldn't be bad. It should only be $180,000. But with my degree, they say that,  
**[0:50:58-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:50:58):**  you know, starting positions are 60 to $80,000 in that field. Like, okay.  Math doesn't compute.  I don't know where you took a financial literacy course, but yeah, that doesn't,  
**[0:51:14-0:51:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:51:14):**  that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. Like moral hazard. You know, it's not  not, that's what it is. It's a moral hazard situation. Like the government has allowed  people to put themselves in a position of moral hazard where they have, they don't know what  
**[0:51:35-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:51:35):**  they're signing up for. It's debt you can't get rid of. And they're preying on, you know, 18,  19 year old kids that have not been told in public school that have not been taught about debt  and interest and what a fucking legal binding contract is.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:51:53):**  Yeah. You know, like 100%.  Oh, I get it. That's my,  Well, yeah. And, and, and, and you're, you're totally right. And so, so there's something  
**[0:52:05-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:52:05):**  for you to know that you didn't know that waking up this morning, you and Ashton Kutcher have the  same feelings about that particular thing. So he started this TV or he's executive producer of this  along with another guy named Dan Rosenweig. And Dan is kind of a, a big deal in New York. He's  
**[0:52:23-0:52:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:52:23):**  in the financial circles. He's been, he's currently CEO of a company called Chegg.  And he's just really, really smart. You know, he's bootstrapped built from the ground up.  He was past COO of Yahoo. Big interest in fender guitar right now and several other things. He,  
**[0:52:41-0:52:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:52:41):**  he knows business, right? And it's really cool to meet people like that. And so I guess to finish  the story about the TV show, they asked us to be on it. We were accepted and we did some filming  and I don't know, I don't know. I probably shouldn't release much more other than it was  
**[0:52:58-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:52:58):**  a really strange experience to be filmed. We were, I have Air Buds on today that I didn't  even know what Air Buds were when I started this whole experience, you know, and now,  now I'm comfortable with it. And now they're handing, now that they're, you know, somebody  
**[0:53:13-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:53:13):**  hands you this little brick with a wire coming out and a microphone. You're like, oh yeah,  just throw that back pocket, feed this microphone up through the shirt, clip that sucker right here.  Yeah. A hundred percent. And when they ask you to do your fourth take at something that's pretty  
**[0:53:26-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:53:26):**  inane, you're, you're just good with it. You're just chill. And you just know what's going on now.  It was super strange the first couple of times I, I was, I will say I had to be really need four  takes of me opening a gate. Like really, do we really need four takes of this? Or, oh, can you  
**[0:53:42-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:53:42):**  do that again? That was really cool. I'm like, okay, yeah, let me go get that cow back and let  her stand right here. And I'll tell her to do the exact same thing she just did. Exactly. Exactly.  No, you're dead on. And so, no, the whole experience was like surreal in the end, looking  
**[0:53:59-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:53:59):**  back that we were even picked for this. We have not seen any of the episodes. They must have 30  hours of runtime, maybe more of interviews and stuff. We had to do some on it's totally not  staged. So that, I mean, I just told you about having to do multiple takes. That's a little  
**[0:54:15-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:54:15):**  different. The show is not staged at all. You know, it's basically a documentary style, like  reality show type thing. Oh, we didn't get that. Can you walk back? Can you come back over here  and walk back to the pickup? Yep. Yep. Yep. But you never know what's going to happen. Like  
**[0:54:31-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:54:31):**  they wandered around for like three hours. One day, Faith was trying to go out and do a deal  with the sheep herd and they couldn't find the sheep herd in the end. So she didn't really know  where she was going and they wandered around out there and finally came back. So there's a lot of  
**[0:54:43-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:54:43):**  things that aren't really planned on it, but I don't know what it's going to look like when it's  done. But I will say this, Brian, they helped us and they helped us with financial aspects that I  was not experienced in. I hadn't reached that level of expertise in the business and I've gotten a ton  
**[0:55:03-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:55:03):**  of foundation. They looked at our ranching business, which basically is a bundle of assets  in some land that we've invested in that is coupled with a lot of debt. Then they looked at  our original enterprise, which was custom grazing. And they looked at that and they said, that's  
**[0:55:19-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:55:19):**  beautiful. You don't have to own anything to do that. And you make some money. And then they  looked at the livestock ownership and you know what they said? They said, risk. They said, this  is cool when it works, but when it doesn't work, this seems like it sinks you. And I could believe  
**[0:55:35-0:55:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:55:35):**  the astute non-traditionalist, they know nothing about ag. They very quickly boiled it down into  the truth on ag. Because you through your experience with ranching for profit,  you know how to write, you know how to keep your books and you know how to talk in terms that they  
**[0:55:56-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:55:56):**  understand, that business people understand, which is something that, you know, I hate to say it,  that a lot of cattlemen and ranchers lack because they just don't have any experience with that.  They've been, you know, listening to their bank, the same banker for 30 years that's making 7% off  
**[0:56:14-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:56:14):**  of them right now. Right. But yeah, totally. I totally get that analysis and breakdown. I feel  that in my checkbook. Like custom grazing is great. And I was just sitting here. Well,  not just sitting here. I've kind of been thinking about this for a while. Like,  
**[0:56:35-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:56:35):**  is that I feel like the packers managed to quote, chickenize the beef industry  without anybody knowing about it, without anybody having to build confinement barns.  They got us all to do Angus cows. Like there's, you know, four or five major bloodlines of Angus  
**[0:56:54-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:56:54):**  cows. That's the majority of slaughter beef. Black cows, black cows, certified Angus beef,  you know, and just what you said that, you know, the people from the TV broke it down.  Owning livestock is risk. When it works, it works great. But most of the time,  
**[0:57:10-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:57:10):**  it's risk and it sucks. Custom grazing, great second base hit, great for cash flow,  low risk. Running a business with all your assets, you know, least land, least livestock,  least equipment. Everything goes bad. You can sell everything. You got no debt or get rid of  
**[0:57:27-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:57:27):**  everything. You got no debt. I mean, those are good places to be. It really scares me.  You know, in 2022, with record high inflation, interest rates going through the roof,  you got people that are like, well, it's a good time to start ranch.  
**[0:57:42-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:57:42):**  People are like, well, it's a good time to start ranch. I'm going to go buy 200 acres and I'm going  to put 50 cows on it. And we're just going to build a lot. We're going to feed hay because  there's an ethanol plant down the road. And that's what it's turned into. It's turned into  
**[0:58:02-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:58:02):**  like Angus formula feeding for everybody. Which you know, that's okay. It'd be okay if those  people that you know, were raising state cattle got stake price, but they don't. They get hamburger  price for state cattle that are fed $8 corn. Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't agree more. And it just  
**[0:58:22-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:58:22):**  doesn't the margins in livestock ownership. So here's something that I think you are doing a  good job. I think at developing a genetics program, naturally acclimated to your range.  I see the picture of them behind you. I was there probably really close to that. They look awesome.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:58:42):**  I love seeing your cattle. Yeah. We drove down this road. That's the spec. Yeah. Yeah. We did  drive down that road. Yep. Yep. It looked pretty familiar, but you, you, you would, I just want  to see where you stand on this. I would postulate that we don't get paid most of the time for our  
**[0:58:59-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:58:59):**  genetics on a commercial basis, unless we're doing seed stock, unless we're doing direct sales,  unless we were doing a cushy, why goo cross? So we get an extra, you know, leg up on the calf sales,  commodity, commoditization commodities, because food prices are artificially held so low to the  
**[0:59:17-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:59:17):**  producer. We don't get paid for it. And I would argue that it's flirting with not flirting with,  it is considerably under where it would be if it were not subsidized by mom getting a job in town  by, you know, just hopper lifestyles where, where, where, yeah, you drive a $80,000 pickup,  
**[0:59:38-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:59:38):**  you only get paid for what your grocery bill is each month. You have no savings account,  you know, that that's so common. That's like in agriculture right now. That's what needs to change.  Try it. You try to sell any has holes or quarters lately?  
**[0:59:54-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=0:59:54):**  No. Like, I don't want anybody to think bad any of my friends, but it just seems like there's a  lot of America that's living hand to mouth that doesn't even have $500 to spare. Yeah.  That like doesn't even have a spare 500 bucks in our checking account by, you know, a half or a  
**[1:00:09-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:00:09):**  quarter. I that's, that's a bad situation to be in. I mean, and that's, I've felt that I've been  there multiple times in my life, you know, and I have to, and I try not to be there. I don't want  to live there. No, no, it's very, but that's, that's, you know, that's ag. We are a total  
**[1:00:30-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:00:30):**  bundle of all this wealth wrapped up and it is real well, if you choose to capitalize on it,  if you do not choose to capitalize on it in some manner, you will just sit on it until suddenly you  don't have that wealth anymore. Whether you're forced to sell it or you are, you know, for some  
**[1:00:50-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:00:50):**  reason, right? Like eventually eminent domain for some utility or something will, or you have to  capitalize on it and get it going. Like you can't say, I would argue that you can't sit on a nest  egg and just, just hope to have it a hundred years from now for your family. It just is not going to  
**[1:01:07-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:01:07):**  happen. You have to get it in motion. Things are only going up or going down. There is no such  thing as a plateau. And that's just the fact. And that's, that's where a lot of, I think a lot of  people would think in, in traditional family ranches that they're in a plateau, you know,  
**[1:01:22-1:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:01:22):**  they'd be willing to admit like, Hey, we're plateaued. We're comfortable. And, and I don't  think that's true. I think they're really, they're showing a negative ROI on an economic basis by  benchmark math. And that means intrinsically they're losing value and it's all in it's on  
**[1:01:39-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:01:39):**  to fortunately for right now, that's not into cash value, but I would argue that without CFAP  injections three years ago in 2020, I would argue without, you know, a bit of an uptick in commodity  in gains right now, this year, well, either of those years, 2020 or 2022 would have been disaster.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:01:57):**  And, and, and I would also argue that next year, 2023, I'm excited about the price to beef as well,  or the price of the producer value of beef as much as anybody. Like we saw some $1,200, $1,300  calves sell. We saw some $1,600 yearlings, $1,700 yearlings, even $2,000 yearlings. That's great.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:02:16):**  But the input cost is so high. The margin is much thinner than it was in 2014. And so we're getting  excited about this. It's not something to be excited about. We're barely treading water.  And that's where we're being kept. So, and I think that like, they're telling us that it's  
**[1:02:30-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:02:30):**  a good thing. Like they're telling us that we're doing better, but I don't see anybody doing better.  I don't see anybody doing better either. I don't see one of the big metrics that I use. Now, this  is an old fashioned metric. It's who's buying land. There's very few, it is not ranch money.  
**[1:02:49-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:02:49):**  And there's a very few very astute ranchers. And I worked with a couple of them who are buying land,  but they're doing it very creatively, we'll say. And they're very, very intelligent in what they're  doing. But the deal of like the rancher who looks good, right? Shiny on the outside, green tractors,  
**[1:03:06-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:03:06):**  red tractors, let's not start a war there. Whatever color tractors, they look like they are doing well.  I don't see a lot of those buying, you know, the neighbor's little chunk that comes up for sale  very often. Most of them are still making land payments on the one they picked up in 2009,  
**[1:03:22-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:03:22):**  you know, and they're going to be for their whole life span.  I got to pay a bill, but when we come back, let's talk about some of those creative ways that your friends are using to buy land.  Cool, cool. Introducing C90 Ocean Minerals.

**[1:04:51-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:04:51):**  happy to be working with C90. They're a good outfit. Cows sure like the mineral or like the salt.  And I was sitting here thinking while that ad read was going at some of the beef that I'm  getting back from the locker. I'm going to make some of my own beef jerky. I got to try to make some beef jerky.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:05:08):**  What's the best beef to make beef jerky out of? Stuff that's really, really lean and doesn't have a lot of marbling.  You bet. I think I can cover that.  I think I could find some of that in these old, some of my old cull cows. So we were talking  
**[1:05:26-1:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:05:26):**  before the break about some creative ways to buy land. That's kind of been a reoccurring theme  with this conversation is, you know, how do we, how does somebody starting out acquire land resources,  livestock, and contacts to be able to break into this business? And before I turn you loose again,  
**[1:05:46-1:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:05:46):**  some of the advice that I've been trained to give is multi-species. Sure. So your ball. Sure.  Yeah. So the first thing is, I like to think in terms of paradigm shifts from the norm.  And the first thing is to realize that land is a, an after tax dollars investment. And secondly, it is different.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:06:09):**  You do not have to be an owner operator anymore. That's dead. It's gone probably forever. And so,  so once those things are broken, you have to have money from somewhere to invest in land.  And ideally you need that to be from multiple income streams, right, Ryan, that are all leaving  
**[1:06:28-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:06:28):**  you some money after tax. So these are, these are not, what I'm saying is not heresy. That is a fact.  If you do not have that, the land you try to get into, you will be back out of within three to five  years. I mean, that's just the way it works. You cannot bank on, I would especially argue right now  
**[1:06:47-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:06:47):**  on inflate inflation and appreciation on your land in this, you know, we don't know what that's going  to be. And so it has been a great speculation in the last 30 years. Banking on land appreciation  to cashflow your ranch by like borrowing out that equity as you're going is a recipe to lose.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:07:06):**  It's a recipe to lose because you can't outweigh it. You, yeah, it's going to work in your favor.  Land is everybody you'll talk to, everybody I talked to, they will say every piece of land I've  ever bought was too expensive at the time. It didn't work, but it helped me out in the long run.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:07:23):**  And so I guess I would back up by saying, I think that land is a great investment, but it has to  come second to you producing something first. And so the thing that's broken is you can't go buy the  land of the cows that's broken. I think we all understand that we don't need to talk about it  
**[1:07:38-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:07:38):**  anymore. The people that I know that are buying land are doing it because they have very successful  businesses already going that are able to throw dollars at land investment. And that's what they're  singularly focused on. They're willing to do something around the edges of their land to do  
**[1:07:57-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:07:57):**  something to capture a value from. And I would argue that that becomes a pretty wide range.  So the intrinsic value of land seems to me to always be the productive value. And there is some  land, I would say some dry land, especially I think on dry land crops, that seems to be pretty  
**[1:08:13-1:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:08:13):**  well valued for the productive value. That's kind of the value. And often that's flat boring land.  It doesn't have a lot of other value. Maybe the intrinsic value on it is probably the productive  value plus the program coverage, to be honest, of insurance and things like that. That makes the  
**[1:08:34-1:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:08:34):**  value on that land. This is just my take on it. And I could be proved wrong on any of this.  On rangeland that we look at a lot, the value is in other stuff and it's inflated to,  I don't know, double if not three times the value of the productive value. So for example,  
**[1:08:52-1:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:08:52):**  we have some rangeland that produces 200 pounds per acre of forage harvestable. That's really low.  But that exists. That's country where it takes 50, 60, 70 acres to graze a cow for the year.  There's some ground not too far away that probably doesn't have that much grass on it.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:09:11):**  Yeah. Well, that's too bad because I know you have a much better land resource. But long story short,  that land is valued today probably at say $800 an acre. Okay, cool. So we own some of that land. We  bought some invested in some of that land. And I want that to be on my balance sheet as high as I  
**[1:09:36-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:09:36):**  can get it. Right. So that's great. So let's say it's worth $800 an acre. I can't pay for that land  for more than about, if we use the same metric somewhere around $200 an acre is roughly what the  productive value of that land is. Okay. All the numbers we're using here are going to be wrong.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:09:53):**  But the point is valid. Okay. So that's the formula still works. The formula still works.  So there's no way I so the question is, A, should we invest in that land at $800 an acre?  And B, if so, why? Well, we're going to have to develop something else. So when you get into that  
**[1:10:15-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:10:15):**  land, there are different values. The first value I would argue is probably the tourism.  Type value and that encompasses hunting, it encompasses recreation, it encompasses  like scenic. So think rocks, trees and water, you know, that seems to be the core of it.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:10:34):**  If you've got those, you've got like some topography that you're like game on, like that's  pretty investable from a land investment. And ironically, in some respects, some of the most  aesthetically pleasing land is actually some of the poorest pasture like you've already brought  
**[1:10:50-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:10:50):**  up like it's, it's, it's hard to get around in with your whole, you know, you have to have a  horse, you can't get around with a with a buggy or a four wheeler or a motorbike, you know, and,  and so, so those are counters sometimes and sometimes not. But a lot of your more boring  
**[1:11:07-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:11:07):**  type land, it's valued closer to productive value. A lot of your really pretty lands closer  to Yellowstone National Park, it's valued for all these other values. And then there are other  values that are so those things can be captured on, conceptualized and cash flow for recreation  
**[1:11:24-1:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:11:24):**  purposes. And if you invest in land like that, you have to conceptualize quickly, I would argue,  you can't, you can't wait five years to get in a hunting lease, you if you're going to do it,  you have to do it right away. Or the cash flow will drive you out of business like we just talked.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:11:41):**  The other values are these development type things. And that's how I break things in my mind  is into this really simple forms, development, meaning surface access, like maybe they need to  cross with a pipeline, they need to cross with a transmission corridor, that I think these are  
**[1:11:58-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:11:58):**  things that I see people looking at when they're investing in land, and they say, there's already a  pipeline corridor in the area, they're probably going to go through here again with another  pipeline in the next 10 years, it's a pretty good bet. In those corridors, they don't get access to  
**[1:12:12-1:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:12:12):**  new corridors very often, they love to parallel the old corridors, like and a pipeline access,  a lot of people spend a lot of time fighting them, I have no problem with personal fighting  anything and getting it to go around your ranch for certain reasons. What I will say is, you're  
**[1:12:28-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:12:28):**  leaving money on the table, if you don't at least consider it these other forms of income. And I've  seen those things pay for the ranch, it feels like in the first couple years for a pipeline going  across or pay for a good chunk of it enough that it made it worthwhile. So the in that example I  
**[1:12:43-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:12:43):**  gave, it's worth 200 an acre intrinsically, there's an extra $600 an acre and other stuff, I think  it's not unreasonable to pick up $100 an acre value amortized over time in your hunting rights,  your recreational rights. I think if you pick up another $300 in value in development rights,  
**[1:13:02-1:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:13:02):**  and that gets you in the ballpark of paying for that land, and that gets you to a negotiation  table. And that's how land values exist. The people that I see investing in more land are  willing to try for that extra thing. And I think that it depends on their level of financial  
**[1:13:18-1:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:13:18):**  maturity, the most successful ones usually are willing to speculate just a bit that they might  not know what that thing is, but they know there's going to be a thing. And they usually find that  out during their due diligence and their price discovery period. And but I would argue that they  
**[1:13:33-1:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:13:33):**  try to buy it closer to productive value, and throw that in on top, you know, so, and those  guys are successful, those guys and gals, and, and the people that are doing that sort of, but if you  go in the mindset of being a rancher, and you're going to mortgage your ranch, you're running cow  
**[1:13:51-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:13:51):**  calf, and you're going to buy the neighbor's ranch, you won't even get to talk to the bank.  I mean, unfortunately, because the last thing they want is five years from now they know they're just  going to be trying to resell your ranch. And they don't want to do that either. And I think that's  
**[1:14:07-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:14:07):**  going to be a real difficult thing right now. I look at this year, Brian, I started this year with  a 5% interest rate on my line of credit. I am going to end this year, I might be double that.  I don't know where it's headed. But I know that I'm over seven right now. And when that last  
**[1:14:23-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:14:23):**  three quarter hike comes when I haven't got the letter about it yet, but it might be in the mailbox  and that's going to be nine. They haven't been regularly coming every 28 days. You haven't been  getting those rate increase notices regularly? No, we're working with an awesome bank. But  
**[1:14:40-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:14:40):**  coming quarterly is bad enough because it jumps up by higher than you keep track of.  I don't think, maybe they have missed a couple opportunities in the last two months. But there  for a while, I think I got six or seven in a row. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Well, so you want to, you know,  
**[1:14:57-1:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:14:57):**  credit double? Yeah, it doubled. And I think that's what we're planning on ours. We're planning  on on paper, ours being at 9.5 or 10% at the end of this year. And that's what we have to make money  on next year. And if it's not making money, we're not using that credit. Like we have to make 15,  
**[1:15:13-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:15:13):**  20% next year at a bare minimum, to even be worth using that line of credit, or we're going to figure  out how to operate without that line of credit. So that's what we're going to do. So the other thing  that I really saw that inflation is in vehicle, not so much in the vehicle prices, everybody's  
**[1:15:29-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:15:29):**  aware of that. I had got an auto loan at a couple years, I went and looked at auto loans. To get a  new auto loan today, like I would have thought like six and a half, seven percent was like,  that's too much risk. I'm not sure I like that in the past five, six years. And I've done a couple  
**[1:15:46-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:15:46):**  when I needed to. And then we've quickly restructured them and got them down to five  percent or four percent. Well, I went and looked the other day and and freecreditreport.com for  what it's worth. It said that it was offering automobile rates at 11 to 16%. I don't know what  
**[1:16:03-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:16:03):**  dealer rates are right now, but I'm just telling you, if that's jumped up, I guarantee that you go  to it, you know, try to finance a car 100% like you could for the last 15 years. I don't think  it's going to happen. I think you're going to have to pay 12% for that money. And that is a terrible  
**[1:16:21-1:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:16:21):**  investment. Where are you finding new vehicles on the lot for sale? Yeah, I don't know. It's all  related, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I haven't seen a 20, I don't think I've seen a 2022 model anything  yet, much less than a dealer lot that somebody could go up and purchase. But yeah, you'll purchase  
**[1:16:41-1:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:16:41):**  price of vehicles. There's a graphic that I did, I'll probably back in the spring and it was it was  really old. It was kind of comparing prices of a pickup in I think like 1972 or 1982 to 2012.  In terms of how many cows or calves steer calves, right? No, it was called cows. It was it was it  
**[1:17:04-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:17:04):**  was cold cow math. And it was like, you know, back in the 80s, you could take three $800 cows to town  and come home with a new pickup for 2500 bucks. And now you need to take about, you know, damn  near 100 $600 cows to town to buy a new feed pickup. That's it. Well, I don't even know if  
**[1:17:27-1:17:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:17:27):**  a guy could get a $60,000 feed pickup brand new right now, like even even the cheapest gas,  one ton short bed tradesman option is probably still 60 or $70,000. Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Well, yeah, and used stuff isn't isn't any better. You know, so there's there's that kind of  
**[1:17:48-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:17:48):**  inflation, there's inflation at the pump, there's the inflation that we're all seeing at the grocery  store. Well, that a lot of folks are seeing at the grocery store that aren't growing their own food.  And money, money's getting expensive. You know, it's, it's bad. And before we segue into something  
**[1:18:08-1:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:18:08):**  we talked about earlier, you know, we've been talking about the productive intrinsic value  of land and buying land and how to do that. And I appreciate your comments on monetizing other  things in the ranch past livestock. And that's something a lot of people don't think about is,  
**[1:18:25-1:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:18:25):**  you know, okay, I want to buy ranch and have cows. Well, a lot of us want to do that. So,  we don't have to deal with people. But at the end of the day, it's the connections, it's the people  that really make the world go round. And it's the connections that make us whole and keep us grounded  
**[1:18:40-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:18:40):**  to the universe. And who are we to hoard this land and not allow others to enjoy it? Yeah.  Now, there's the other part of that is, you don't just want to open up the ranch to the general  public because, you know, we see what national parks look like. Right. You know, and they have  
**[1:19:04-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:19:04):**  a budget for road maintenance. They have a budget for trash cleanup. They have, you know, they have  restrooms. Like, if there was maybe a way to allow people to enjoy the land and they wouldn't disturb  it, that would be one thing. But, you know, the way society is like opening up my place to the  
**[1:19:22-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:19:22):**  general public, that's the last thing I want to do. But, you know, being able to sell some day  fishing. Yeah. You know, that's a thing. Sell bird watching. You know, even if you don't,  yeah, if you don't have a livestock resource, do you have electricity? Do you have water? Do you,  
**[1:19:43-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:19:43):**  you know, putting RV hookups in is cheap. It's a relatively cheap thing. And those can turn for  50 or $80 a night or even more depending on location. You know, it doesn't take long to pay  off a $400 install for, you know, a water hydrant and a power plug when you're paying that off at  
**[1:20:00-1:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:20:00):**  50 or $100 a night. Well, I think if you go to other countries, which I'm not claiming to be a  world traveler, but I've read about a lot of this. We're spoiled to death here in America with vacant  land that we don't use for anything. And we are spoiled with like all this stuff that we think we  
**[1:20:21-1:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:20:21):**  need. Yeah. And we're just not doing a good job of capturing all of it. You know, if we were,  the just federal land, for example, that wouldn't exist other places. We have a luxury here in the  United States to have that like kind of a deal or, or if it was existing in other places, it'd be  
**[1:20:41-1:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:20:41):**  federally owned lands that is then collectively farmed in some sort of manner, wonder somewhat  negative. I think you might almost have it backwards. That in a lot of European countries,  yep, that there's not really private land ownership. There might be like a writ of  
**[1:20:59-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:20:59):**  occupation or, you know, but you don't, you lease it from the federal government. Yeah. Like,  England is, England is, England is probably different, you know, because there are people  that actually own land there. Then there are people that, you know, that live on crown land,  
**[1:21:14-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:21:14):**  that work crown land. And then there's people that, you know, there's trust, there's public  trust land that, that, you know, way more complicated. I don't live there. I don't care.  I don't care. Like three people listen to this podcast live there. If you want to know more  
**[1:21:26-1:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:21:26):**  about it, we'll do another show. But anyway, intrinsic value of land. Yeah. Getting, getting  more people out there and getting them back in touch, not just with the land, but with livestock.  And I guess the comment I really want to make is how far distorted are the, in how,  
**[1:21:48-1:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:21:48):**  I get my words together one of these days,  how distorted is the intrinsic production value of the land? How much is that being  distorted by things like crop insurance, sun disease, or even pasture insurance like a PRF?  
**[1:22:07-1:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:22:07):**  Right. It has to be significant. I don't know if it's 50% or, you know, 10%, Brian,  probably somewhere in that range. Wouldn't you guess? Yeah. But you know, all, all of those things,  crop insurance, the subsidies, the LRF, you know, the CFAP that you've talked about,  
**[1:22:26-1:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:22:26):**  all these are tools that, that the government is giving us to quote, mitigate risk. And a lot of  it I don't see is necessarily mitigating risk. You know, it's, it's moral hazard of not being  accountable, not being responsible for the financial implications of your choices. That's  
**[1:22:48-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:22:48):**  what moral hazard is. And right now there's a lot of people in the livestock industry that own cows  that have put a lot that have exposed themselves to a lot of moral hazard.  Yep. In the worst way, you know, whether it's with their money and a living animal that they  
**[1:23:06-1:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:23:06):**  don't have a plan to feed. Yeah. Or it's, or it's somebody that has, has risked more than they have,  because they're held up by that, by that safety net of crop insurance and subsidy and PRF.  And the thought that's on my mind right now, like, I learned how to manage without PRF.  
**[1:23:30-1:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:23:30):**  Okay. PRF is not a tool in my toolbox. Anybody that's listened to me for more than probably  three episodes know that I love to yell taxation is theft, subsidies are socialism. And that's what  I see PRF as. It's just, it's, it's, it's a social, it's a subsidy. It's a subsidy. It's  
**[1:23:47-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:23:47):**  socialism. Like you can't tell me that, Oh yeah, it returns back over the long term, 110% of your  premiums back to you in your pocket over a long term, 10 year period. That's how the program's  designed. That's obviously a subsidy. Like that's, that's taking money from somebody else. Okay.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:24:04):**  And the way I look at a PRF, okay. In a good year, I can owe them like 30, $40,000.  I can't afford that in a good year. Like the payments in a bad year would be nice. Like right  now, it'd be great to have that PRF money, but I couldn't afford it if it rained next year.  
**[1:24:25-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:24:25):**  And that's the, that's the thing that bugs me is like guys will see this PRF and they'll say,  okay, well my grass is insured. And if it doesn't rain, I'll just get all this PRF money. I'll go  buy hay. And that model works up to a point that model works up until the drought gets big enough  
**[1:24:49-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:24:49):**  and long enough that we're in a situation like rent. You know, you're in third year.  I still say I'm in second year looking at third. And I, you know, I totally get that,  that, you know, that first year that you're talking about three years ago, that was relatively  
**[1:25:04-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:25:04):**  weak. And for me down here in Southern into Kansas, it's really dependent on how that jet stream  makes it Southern swing in La Nina and El Nino years on which side of it I am. Because I can,  it's, it can almost be a crapshoot for me right here in the middle of the country.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:25:22):**  Like on a La Nina, I can get hot dry. Then you get cold dry. I can also get the cool wet  of a linear. I'm not getting that. I'm not getting the cool wet and I have not gotten the cool wet.  Let me tell you, it's all in the dry side and it's been that way for three years.  
**[1:25:39-1:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:25:39):**  And you know, looking at another year of it, you know, it, all the PRF payments in the world and  the CFAP payments in the world aren't going to buy hay that doesn't exist. That's my point.  And, and they don't, there's two ways to structure PRF. So, and in full disclosure,  
**[1:26:02-1:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:26:02):**  we use PRF shirts and there are two ways to do it. One is you do it off the math and off the  analogs. And the other is you just hedge your drought risk. You know, what you think is your  months that you're like, I think you know, May and June, if we don't get, so I should just put  
**[1:26:20-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:26:20):**  it all there. We don't get that. We're going to get all the payment, you know, or a big chunk,  and that's hopefully going to make it better. And my only comment is PRF insurance helps you cash  flow and equalize the situation and prevents you from, you know, volatilization. The biggest reason  
**[1:26:39-1:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:26:39):**  we play it though, isn't that Brian. So, so I guess what I was going to say was it does not  ever, we have not had a year, even when we've received significant income from PRF insurance,  rain, pasture rainfall and forage insurance, we have not had that make up for the loss in forage,  
**[1:26:57-1:27:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:26:57):**  although it's helped. It isn't a one for one and, and it's just enough to where you're like,  hell that took the sting out of it. But I will, what I will say is we are only doing programs  because it feels like the current ag system is built on a pay to play. You have to do it system.  
**[1:27:18-1:27:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:27:18):**  And we use FSA financing. And once you're in the system a little bit, then you're in it all the  way. I think a person could run a perfectly viable operation without any of that. But I would say  that our competitors, that is the most alluring part of that to us is that we're in competition  
**[1:27:37-1:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:27:37):**  with lots of people who have, you know, it's easy for them on multiple entities to each one max out  $250,000 of net income due to program payments. And they might do that on six different entities.  And it's hard for us to compete with people who are able to do that if we're just going to take  
**[1:27:52-1:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:27:52):**  the moral stance that we're not. So we do the programs, because we're not in a position to not  be able to, if that makes sense. But I try to do it ethically. We really think about like the CFAP  deal, we took what we thought was maybe helped take the sting out of that market wreck that we  
**[1:28:09-1:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:28:09):**  actually suffered. And we didn't file for stuff over and above that, you know, I would take like  a disaster payment. But only I have not found them to, I've only taken one. And it was nothing  close to the amount of livestock that we lost in a winter blizzard. It was not even close, you know,  
**[1:28:27-1:28:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:28:27):**  it wasn't even a dent. It was just a little bit where it was like, I don't know, I still don't  even know if I'd take that one again, you know, but honestly, I know this, since federal policy  and tax policy is trying to keep food dollars low in the United States of America, under my  
**[1:28:51-1:29:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:28:51):**  understanding of economics, that we are in a system a bit there, where if like my grandpa has  no debt or anything, so he doesn't play any of these systems. I have to make a living. I think  PRF has been a good tool for me and my family. But I know you're not trying to debate PRF. I'm just  
**[1:29:11-1:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:29:11):**  saying that I totally agree with you. But I'm seeing from the other side of the coin of like,  gah, I feel like I've almost had to do some of this stuff. And that's a problem.  Oh, I 100% get that it makes complete business sense for you and for a lot of other folks in  
**[1:29:28-1:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:29:28):**  other situations. It just doesn't work for me. It just doesn't work for me.  I'm with you, man. I'm with you. I love and so I was listening to a great economist that I want to  really throw out there, Peter Zion, or Zian, I don't know how to pronounce his last name.  
**[1:29:51-1:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:29:51):**  Peter Zion. Yeah, he's a geopolitical analyst. We've talked about him on the show a couple times.  Oh, I love what he's I not just because I like parts of what he's saying for American ag. But I  think that what he's saying makes a ton of sense. And he's a macro economist. And that seems to be  
**[1:30:09-1:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:30:09):**  the only part of economics that makes any sense to me is the macro, you know, to be honest, that's  the real long term, like how do we build something that's sustainable for the future of our family.  So a few little nutshells of that, that makes sense. And I know we'll be right up your alley.  
**[1:30:24-1:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:30:24):**  Localized ag, we're not going to be shipping these commodities. For goodness sakes, in 2022,  30% of our beef exports have went to China, that market did not exist two years ago. Can you imagine  what a black swan that would be labeled if China just cuts off tomorrow? You know, I think, and  
**[1:30:42-1:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:30:42):**  the strong dollar that we're faced with right now, he would say that more localized is the only way  things are going to survive. We're not going to be frating. I'm not going to be frating alfalfa  hay to you in Kansas, and you're not going to be frating calves to me to summer, you know, and this  
**[1:30:59-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:30:59):**  mismatches stuff all around the world, we need to figure out how we're going to do it within our  little box. And that's going to be the future. And I don't think that we're going to be sending  unit trains of corn over the Rocky Mountains to California. I don't think we're going to be I  
**[1:31:14-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:31:14):**  don't think we should be pumping water over two mountain ranges to irrigate agriculture in a  to irrigate agriculture in a desert. So you know, we're talking about Peter's eye on it. He has a  his latest book out, I think it's called The End of the World is Just Beginning. It came out  
**[1:31:32-1:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:31:32):**  came out in June or July. It's on audiobook. I mean, it's great. And it was finished in February  just before the Ukraine war. Yep. And since the Ukraine war has been going on, I've been I've been  really trying to keep up on what Peter says on his YouTube channels. And you know, some of the  
**[1:31:48-1:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:31:48):**  couple of podcasts that he's done since then, and update his predictions. I respect what you're  saying. But I think his outlook for US agriculture is far too rosy. Sure, sure. And, you know,  that's probably a good segue, you know, to talk about a new model of ranching. Yeah,  
**[1:32:08-1:32:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:32:08):**  a new breed of cattle coming to dominance and the market implications of high feed prices and what  that's going to do to food price down the line. Sounds like a ton of fun. So it was your term,  you said new model of ranching. So let's start there and take that one apart. Perfect. So  
**[1:32:28-1:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:32:28):**  because it's a land based thing, ranching, livestock, and such, we have to have the land  to do it on. And because the land paradigm has shifted from an owner operator to a land investor  and an operator, two totally different things. That is the new model of ranching has to be built  
**[1:32:48-1:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:32:48):**  around that. So in my mind, for somebody starting out, finding land that they are not even thinking  about owning land is the most healthy model that they need to be into. That doesn't mean that they  won't own land someday. What it means is, they need to be doing that when they have the means  
**[1:33:08-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:33:08):**  of cash flow, and then they can become a land investor. And then they need to be thinking in  a different hat, putting on a land investor hat when they're dealing with their land investor.  And then you take that hat off when they're operating on that land. They're related at  
**[1:33:20-1:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:33:20):**  the biological level and the ecological level, but they are not related on a business level anymore.  It just doesn't work. And that may change, that could change. A depression could change that and  make it all right back to the intrinsic value. And a person doesn't want to rule that out,  
**[1:33:35-1:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:33:35):**  I don't think, according to Peter Zihon or anybody else. So the model of being an operator requires  you to have soft skills, people skills. That's exactly where you're headed. And that is so  important. Here we are, and I've said it before, but a bunch of people who don't really like people  
**[1:33:56-1:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:33:56):**  and we're wanting to just get away from everybody and be all by ourselves in the middle of nowhere.  And that's really cool. That is American exceptionalism at its core at some level,  but the other half of that is toil and work. And unfortunately, energy units don't compute right  
**[1:34:16-1:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:34:16):**  now. You can't work enough. There isn't enough daylight hours. It worked before the invention  of the tractor. You know what I mean, Brian? And after that, so it still works in third world  countries all over the world. But right now- Where fuel is expensive.  
**[1:34:34-1:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:34:34):**  Exactly. But the economics have changed here because of convenience, because of all this stuff  where we can work so hard, but I can't make enough money for my family without doing outside things,  you know, or going, and own the land and so on and so forth. So with that new thing in mind,  
**[1:34:55-1:35:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:34:55):**  I think the other important thing is that you don't have to own all the livestock and that's  part of the new model. I do believe in the economies of scale, because that does exist  out of the current commodity system. For example, while it still exists, because some of the stuff  
**[1:35:10-1:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:35:10):**  that Peter Zion talked about was a long ways down the road. Not a long ways, but not long enough to  be comfortable with, but 20 years down the road, 10 years down the road. While it still exists,  where we're freighting livestock around, I do think it behooves you to think in terms of labor  
**[1:35:25-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:35:25):**  units and in terms of freight loads of livestock, if you're going to be moving said livestock very  far or marketing said livestock. Okay. What do you mean by labor loads and freight loads?  Labor units. So labor units are totally different than freight units, but they're both basically,  
**[1:35:41-1:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:35:41):**  you know, let's just call them expenses. Freight units are expenses per animal,  so they're direct costs. Labor units are an overhead cost for most of us. So two things-  But I get that. I'm just, I'm wondering how they're related in that statement.  
**[1:35:56-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:35:56):**  Totally. Totally. So with sale of livestock in marketing, freight units becomes important.  You need to have a load lot of calves to command that last little bit of value on that. If you're  going to be in the commodity cycle, and that exists for grain commodities, exists in oil,  
**[1:36:13-1:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:36:13):**  all the commodities, you have to be thinking about freight right now under the current system.  And I think I would argue, you need to think about it more right now by double than you did a year  ago because freight has doubled. And I think that a lot of the inputs into ag is going to be in  
**[1:36:27-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:36:27):**  freight and a lot of that has a lag time that's like a year or two years. And I don't think we're  paying for that right now yet. I think we're going to be paying in another year, there's going to be  a lot of people that need a bigger operating line of credit because what they were just doing at  
**[1:36:41-1:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:36:41):**  $3 a mile does not work at $7 a mile, you know, moving cattle around, moving freight. Okay. So  so what I mean by a lay, I think you do have to, there's two ways to go about it.  Unless you're going to direct market all of your animals on your place, which which can work,  
**[1:36:59-1:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:36:59):**  but it's a ton of work, as you know, Brian, the other way, if you're going to enter the commodity  cycle and sell calves or steers, or bred heifers, anything, you have to sell a load of them or be  ready to sell load. Now I'm not saying you have to ultimately do that. But I would argue that it  
**[1:37:16-1:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:37:16):**  pays you to reach an economy of scale there at a certain level. And one truckload is a nice  economy of scale that will enable you to do it cheaper than taking that same truckload in horse  trailer loads with your time to the same mark. Okay. Doesn't matter the distance of the market,  
**[1:37:32-1:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:37:32):**  the same thing. It's just math. So we tend to think in terms of labor units for a minimum  a viable operation. So, for example, if you're going to sell commodity calves, you better have  100 steer calves to sell, or as close to 48,000 to 52,000 pounds as you can. So that might be 110,  
**[1:37:54-1:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:37:54):**  might be 115. To produce 115 steer calves, you've got to have at least double that right in cows,  but you're not gonna have a perfect... You probably need about 250 cows.  Yeah, 250 to 300 is really the number because you're only gonna have, you know, 85% of animals  
**[1:38:10-1:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:38:10):**  exposed that actually produce a calf or wean a calf the following year, you know, so you've got  to be greater in number. So that gets you a minimum economy of scale if you're going to chase  a commodity yield. The only reason I say all that is because you better not think about selling into  
**[1:38:24-1:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:38:24):**  the commodities without doing some extra stuff, unless you're going to reach that minimum economy  of scale. And that is a fact. Now you can reach that scale on little small holdings in an urban  environment, I would argue, you know, moving your cows around a lot. I've seen people be successful  
**[1:38:39-1:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:38:39):**  with that. You can reach it in the large West when you're willing to work at a big BLM a lot,  it doesn't matter either. So, um, but then the other part of it, and I'll tie it in with labor,  is you have to be able to fundamentally take care of those animals at a high degree, you know,  
**[1:38:55-1:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:38:55):**  where animal stewardship is being done and animal husbandry is being taken care of. And animal  welfare is not going away. We have to be very diligent in taking care of our animals. And so  we tend to think, you know, I think that the Burke-Tikert idea of one cow per thousand,  
**[1:39:13-1:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:39:13):**  or on sorry, one man per thousand cows is great from a financial perspective,  but it's pretty unhealthy. I think, you know, for the people involved in working on that environment.  But economically, you can't hardly go under one man per 400 cows, it just the math doesn't work.  
**[1:39:30-1:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:39:30):**  We don't have that much margin to pay for that guy. And so somewhere in there is probably the  number. And we tend to think of that when we're picking up a new lease at this point in time.  So the first step to that, though, is what can you do, you know, and a person reaches a point  
**[1:39:46-1:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:39:46):**  of saturation after you've been three years working every day, and you have never had a day  off, and you're in suddenly, you're trying to get married or something, it works great as a single  person, you can go do a lot of stuff, when you try to get married, and then suddenly you have another  
**[1:40:02-1:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:40:02):**  person there, who's probably not willing to go work with you the same hours and go do the same  stuff that you're perfectly content to do. I mean, this is nice.  And that kind of wants you home every once in a while.  
**[1:40:12-1:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:40:12):**  They want to see you like that's why they married you. And it has nothing to do with the finances,  it has nothing to do with anything else. They just want to see you. And it's it, it, it won't  exist very long, where you're all in the field, like doing these pasture walks, barefoot, moving  
**[1:40:26-1:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:40:26):**  stuff that won't exist very long is my promise, you know, that's a glorified thing. It can exist  after a period of time, when you try to step back in. But to get full circle to there.  So the first labor unit you pick up beyond is yourself. The second one, it's pretty easy to do  
**[1:40:44-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:40:44):**  that make a good living. But then after you went three years, you've never had a vacation, you've  never had a vacation, you've never gotten away for a weekend, you're going to look at hiring  somebody else just to take the load off. And that's going to start as like contract labor.  
**[1:40:55-1:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:40:55):**  Contract labor can be a great thing. And a lot of people would stop there at scale. Like,  I'm claiming in all this, a big hypothesis is labor units define your scale and should define  your scale. And, and contract labor is a great fit for many people. And a lot of people with  
**[1:41:14-1:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:41:14):**  personalities, I think you're probably one of those, Brian, we talked about that, you know,  you don't like having a full time hired man, if I remember right, so on and so forth. That's okay.  Like my grandpa's in that boat, too. But if you want to achieve the next level, then you've got  
**[1:41:28-1:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:41:28):**  to figure out how to, you know, deal with a hired man. And that's, I think it's each, each of us  ourselves has to figure out where we're at on that spectrum. For us, a hired man was like a  breakthrough, like a big breakthrough. Suddenly, we could bounce off each other, we both had like  
**[1:41:45-1:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:41:45):**  time off once in a while, we both got to do cool things, you know, we can split it. And then that  has led into where I went more into management and putting deals together and stuff to where I needed  another hired man. Well, suddenly, I wasn't on site. So the physical labor, the rules that  
**[1:42:04-1:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:42:04):**  applied when I was involved in physical labor didn't apply anymore, because I needed two people  out there, because I built a business that required two people to be out there. So then you  have two people. And that is actually our minimum scale at this point. Now, that is not everybody's  
**[1:42:18-1:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:42:18):**  nor should it be economy of scale. But when we look at a unit, we look at the labor use efficiency  and the freight side, like I just mentioned. So you can say 600 cows, two guys, minimum,  bare bones, and that has to be something that we think we could increase to, you know, 1000 cows  
**[1:42:35-1:42:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:42:35):**  within just a couple years. And that is I think, the model. And a bud William said, that not less  people should be on the land, he thought more people should be on the land. And I have thought  a lot about that statement is because it didn't make sense. Because the same time I was hearing  
**[1:42:51-1:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:42:51):**  that statement, I was getting educated by Burke, who's also a genius in his own veritable, right.  And he's saying, No, we need 1000 cows per man hour. They're saying the same thing. They're just  saying it from different ends of the economic spectrum. But they were thinking the same thing.  
**[1:43:06-1:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:43:06):**  I think that the next value on the land is more people on the land. And you can create redundancy  and systems by having more people not less any business would tell you that that has to exist.  Technology is the thing that bridges that gap. But technology can't get you a fix on the water tank,  
**[1:43:23-1:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:43:23):**  you might get a picture of the water tank that's out of water out there, you still have to go fix  it. And you have to respond within minutes of when you have that information. I would argue that  technology cannot completely replace. And surely you would agree with the ecology part of it,  
**[1:43:38-1:43:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:43:38):**  we have to go out there and feel it, smell it and see it to really get interlaced into the system,  you know, and I have a lot of respect for people who are small horticulturalists or pastoralists,  and are running 20 cows and six sheep. I think it's amazing what they're doing sometimes at a  
**[1:43:54-1:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:43:54):**  really small micro scale. So the scale for me is not the scale for everybody, the labor units for  me is not the same for everybody. But there are some things that happen as you ratchet up in  economies of scale, I get some opportunities. Here's a really simple one. I get because we  
**[1:44:11-1:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:44:11):**  operated at an economy of scale, I might get a free pair of gloves for my trucker, who I paid  $15,000 this year. That's minor. But guess what else I get from my trucker? I get first response.  If he doesn't, he doesn't, he picks up the phone every time he's excited to come to work for us,  
**[1:44:28-1:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:44:28):**  and come and help us. And he can do it Johnny on the spot if I'm in a bind. You don't get that at a  lesser economy of scale, you just can't, they can't afford to come there, and so on and so forth.  So there are things in American capitalism that lead you to have a certain economy of scale.  
**[1:44:43-1:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:44:43):**  And I think that underserving ourselves and our families on our ranches with the labor is really  is really worth focusing on. And so a big chunk of the labor can come. I really like the,  I really like the intent of the Joel Salatin enterprise stacking model. I don't think that  
**[1:45:00-1:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:45:00):**  some of the applications fit everywhere. But I will say that I like the intent of it in that if  you're going to come to work here, create your own position. Create something that adds value  in a complete new economic thing. And I like that model. And I think that we would like to do more  
**[1:45:17-1:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:45:17):**  of that model where somebody comes on and they are creating more value than was there before.  And you're achieving, let's say a bare basic metric of dollars per acre or something has  been increased by their presence on the ranch. And that's a great deal. I think I would go so far as  
**[1:45:34-1:45:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:45:34):**  to say quite heredically that, like we started out this conversation in 20 or 30 years, there will be  more people on the land. I don't think that's even something to argue about. That's a fact.  There's going to be more people on the land because there's going to be, you know, at some level,  
**[1:45:49-1:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:45:49):**  more people. But there will be more dispersion and less conglomeration. And I know that we've  headed there the last few years. A lot of people can only see that far. They're saying, hey,  grand ranches are consolidated. I think that we're going to see consolidation. Why do we see  
**[1:46:07-1:46:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:46:07):**  consolidation, Brian? It's because they have an economic model that pushes for consolidation.  Once that economic model fails or changes, we will see deconsolidation and these things starting to  change. So I think the future for people starting right now is to push your way to scale and it's  
**[1:46:22-1:46:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:46:22):**  going to feel that way. And then you're going to be in a position to maybe you can go operate in  50 years, you know, into something. I mean, that's how it works. Yeah. You're not, I don't think  you're wrong. I think that though, you know, with the current financial economic system,  
**[1:46:45-1:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:46:45):**  unless something changes dramatically with subsidies, because I think, you know,  we hit on it earlier that a lot of, you know, quote, federal food subsidies or federal food,  federal programs are designed to keep food cheap. And I get that. And, you know, I totally  
**[1:47:05-1:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:47:05):**  understand that, you know, good nutrient dense food should be plentiful for all people.  And, you know, there's that asterisk there. But, you know, if you want to eat good nutrient dense  food, you probably shouldn't be shopping a whole lot at Walmart, you definitely need to stay at  
**[1:47:19-1:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:47:19):**  a Dollar General, you know, go to the farmers markets, that's where you're going to find that.  But if that's really the government's goal is to feed everybody nutrient dense food,  farmers markets would be subsidized. Right. But that doesn't, that's not what the system  
**[1:47:36-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:47:36):**  encourages. That's not where the subsidies flow. And, you know, what I'm getting at,  you know, we talked a little bit about the, you know, intrinsic production value of land,  whether we're talking about irrigated cropland or dry land or pasture land,  
**[1:47:51-1:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:47:51):**  or pasture land, that's all being distorted by crop subsidies, you know, and to some extent,  land price in a lot of places is influenced by what a CRP payment would be on a piece of land.  That's why people buy CRP land. That's what it's traded for, for the past 20 years  
**[1:48:10-1:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:48:10):**  is the value. They don't ever do anything with it.  Yeah, it blows my mind that you can buy a piece of ground that's in CRP as long as you keep putting  that contract on it and then pay the land purchase price, like pay your mortgage with a CRP payment  
**[1:48:27-1:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:48:27):**  and still have money left over. While guys like you and I are struggling to pay our damn taxes,  you know, working all day in the hot sun with cows. It doesn't make sense. But so what I'm  saying is, you know, we've got land prices, land values that are distorted by crop insurance by CRP  
**[1:48:47-1:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:48:47):**  by PRF. We've got livestock prices at the barn, you know, the commodity price that's being distorted  by subsidized grain, subsidized feed. At some point, the music has to stop. At some point,  we reach a tipping point where a lot of things become uneconomical. And then,  
**[1:49:14-1:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:49:14):**  I don't know what I'm trying to say, but it's kind of like, it's a house of cards that's on  shaky footing. You know, we built this up and yeah, there's people that make a lot of money  investing in real estate. You know, real estate has always been a successful bedrock of the  
**[1:49:30-1:49:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:49:30):**  American economy. I was alive during 2008. Okay, I remember that real estate meltdown.  And I saw it coming in 2004. Like, I saw a flashing neon sign in red that says,  this shit is bad, and it's going to blow up. It just took a lot longer than I thought it would.  
**[1:49:52-1:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:49:52):**  Sure. And you know, a lot of that money that you know, was that was going to build up  houses that nobody needed, that nobody needed to live in, right? A lot of that money went there.  And you know, with the reforms of the post 2008 reforms, you know, Dodd Frank and a couple of the  
**[1:50:10-1:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:50:10):**  other ones that got through. A lot of that money, I think went to hunting property or ranch property  or to farmland. And it's been underreported. So, there's, I don't know how to say this,  but there's a reckoning coming with the intrinsic production value of land,  
**[1:50:33-1:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:50:33):**  versus food price, versus the labor it takes to make that food. Like, it, we're not, we're not  anywhere close to any point that's sustainable by any measure of imagination, that this current  system can go on at the current prices and the current input prices. Right. And it's worse right  
**[1:50:54-1:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:50:54):**  now that it's been, you're dead on there. And I don't see any relief. Like, I don't, I don't plan  on seeing gasoline back to a dollar 65, probably ever. And that's, and, but there's a lot of people,  I think, that are probably guilty of saying, well, it'll cycle down, this will happen.  
**[1:51:20-1:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:51:20):**  If we saw that, it would be relative value wouldn't be the same. You know, there's just been  another big bite taken out of this whole industry, is all it is. And there's a lot of people that  cleaned up last fall on the farming segment, because they came into the year with expectations  
**[1:51:37-1:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:51:37):**  quite a bit lower. And then suddenly they got this bumper crop year. That's gonna happen in beef.  You're, we're gonna see that. We're gonna want to take advantage of that. Maybe the key in all  of it, Brian, all this forecasting we made, about 50% of that is gonna be right and 50% is gonna be  
**[1:51:53-1:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:51:53):**  totally wrong. I mean, that's, that's as good odds we have to hope for. We don't know which 50%,  but we do have to keep our businesses fluid. And I think that's so important. We have to be ready  to change with the times. You know what, if the market asked me to produce 600 pound calves,  
**[1:52:11-1:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:52:11):**  and, and, and, and it honestly is telling me that I need to be able to react as much as my cringe  to do that. And I hope it doesn't happen. I have to get out the calving barn and get the cattle  out the barn and clean her out and get to calving. If it's telling me to do that, I have to be able  
**[1:52:27-1:52:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:52:27):**  to react. I use that as a really extreme example to say, we can't be so married to these principles,  these things that we've learned as ideas and RFP is that's one big thing that needs cleaned up  about it. It teaches you to think that's all it teaches you to do. It does not teach you to calve  
**[1:52:45-1:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:52:45):**  and make it does not teach you to do any of this. And that's, that's my biggest argument to naysayers  is you really, the number one thing you can do is just to stay educated and, and up to date with  right now. Just have to deal with that, you know, so. What did you learn at Ranching for Profit?  
**[1:53:03-1:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:53:03):**  I learned that I'm an idiot. I learned that the answer is in the group. And I learned that I don't  know how to run a business. That's what I learned at Ranching for Profit. Oh, I heard they just tell  you to calve in the summer. No, they, you get asked a lot of questions that might lead a lot of people  
**[1:53:20-1:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:53:20):**  to the understanding that they should calve in the summer and sell their hay equipment and  quit feeding hay and go into the custom grazing business. It also leads people down completely  different other paths. It leads people to buy a seed stock herd. It leads people to buy  
**[1:53:36-1:53:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:53:36):**  damn apple orchards and get into doing bees. I mean, it's exactly, it's all kinds of stuff.  And I wish people would just say, well, all they teach at Ranching for Profit is you need to  quit making hay, quit feeding hay and calving June and, you know, whatever. Like, okay,  
**[1:53:53-1:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:53:53):**  that's not even intellectually honest assessment of the course. And that's not at all.  Yeah. Yeah. And so without going too far down that tangent, but that's the number one thing I think  we can do, you know, to finish the model, to finish the model that we started discussing,  
**[1:54:10-1:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:54:10):**  the new era of ranching is not going to be steep in tradition. The new tradition has to be that you  will continue to involve your model and that's it. So the model I just talked about, I think  is very pertinent to today's economics. I think we have to be willing to change that. I don't  
**[1:54:30-1:54:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:54:30):**  know as if a person should be, I've been that person who's been flighty and back and forth  between different things and enterprises. That's bad too. But I think like three years,  dig in, try an enterprise. If it's not working, we have certain parameters that it has to meet,  
**[1:54:46-1:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:54:46):**  usually financial metrics and economic metrics. If it doesn't meet those,  realize that economics are changing. And I think that the next 30 years, there's one thing we can  all agree on is going to be more volatile. You know, we're going to get more economic things  
**[1:55:01-1:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:55:01):**  that are telling us to do stuff. So be more willing to change. Maybe the timeframe you  stick with an enterprise shortens a little bit because it has to. And the fact is for a young  person entering bootstrap like we were, we did not have the ability to get into something that  
**[1:55:17-1:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:55:17):**  wasn't going to work because otherwise we were just out of business and we're back to looking  for a job, you know? And that isn't in my wheelhouse. I don't want that. I want to build  a business that can invest in land as an investment because I find value in that. But in doing it,  
**[1:55:32-1:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:55:32):**  I just can't see Sage asking going to work every day in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase.  Like that image just doesn't compute in my brain. No, no. And, but, but, but more and more  frequently I've resonated with people that do. I think I really enjoyed the guy from New York being  
**[1:55:50-1:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:55:50):**  out because we could talk the same language and I've been taught that through RFP. And, and, and  that I think you have to be as, I don't want to say boring terms like sustainable systems thinker  and stuff like that. What I do want to say is you have to realize it starts in the soil and it works  
**[1:56:06-1:56:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:56:06):**  its way up. I think you have to be very focused on that. I think with the animals, you have to be  very focused on husbandry. That's something that's lost. We haven't focused on that since the 50s in  the United States. We need to be thinking about husbandry and caring for those animals to help  
**[1:56:20-1:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:56:20):**  animals are handled on a lot of ranches is horrible. It's horrible. And, and grandpa told me  one time that there's a lot of people in the ag business who are ranchers, second,  third generation who shouldn't even be near a cow. And that was a really good way of saying it.  
**[1:56:36-1:56:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:56:36):**  How did we ever get cows loaded on anything without a hot shot?  Yeah. Yeah. Because they knew what they were doing, you know, and, and that's it. And so,  and then at the upper level where we really lose sight, we can, we, a lot of people can figure out  
**[1:56:50-1:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:56:50):**  those lower level things. And by lower, I mean, ground up people, we got to figure out the people  skills and the networking, and that's going to be the people that are successful in the next 30  years are going to be good at internet, inner working at relationships. The look, there used  
**[1:57:06-1:57:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:57:06):**  to be a localized thing where you could run rough shot over people in a local thing. I think that's  gone away in large part due to the expansionist, you know, globalism where, okay, cool. I can just  do business over there. But I think that maybe some of that, you know, we've got to get along.  
**[1:57:23-1:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:57:23):**  I think it's changing now where you've got to interlace and work together. I, I don't like  infighting within the industry. You and I know that we've talked about that. I don't like,  I really rebel against that. I don't, I frankly don't have time for posturing on that. I take one  
**[1:57:39-1:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:57:39):**  issue at a time. I decide how I feel about that issue. And that's how I feel about that issue.  I don't have time for changing depending on who, how I'm told, you know, and I feel like  that's going to be a general sentiment. Your generation and mine and in the future doesn't  
**[1:57:55-1:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:57:55):**  have time for messing around on that stuff. Yeah. If you want to argue with me, I'm probably not  going to expend the mental energy to try to change your mind because I already know you're wrong.  And you're already close-minded. I mean, a genuine intellectual open-minded conversation with  
**[1:58:12-1:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:58:12):**  anybody. I'll have that. You want to have an argument with me about something you think I've  said? I'm probably going to come down on your pre-hard. You know, you want to misquote me?  Stand by. You know, you want to argue with me about stuff and not respect my viewpoint? Yeah,  
**[1:58:31-1:58:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:58:31):**  we're probably not going to have too long of a conversation. I don't have time for that anymore.  I don't want to spend my mental energy. And it's going to kind of sound shitty. But you know,  usually we're about 40% of people already left by this point. I don't want to talk to sheep anymore.  
**[1:58:48-1:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:58:48):**  Yeah. Like, I'm not going to waste time trying to change the mind of sheep anymore. Like,  I want to talk to I want to talk to other lions. And like, it's now is not the time to try to wake  up more sheep. Like, it's too late for a lot of them. Like, gather your lions and talk to your  
**[1:59:05-1:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:59:05):**  tribe and build your community. That's my mindset moving forward. A hundred percent. And it is all  about community. It's all about family. It's all about people. And, you know, I'm kind of tired of  and I don't know, you're technically an older millennial or young generation next?  
**[1:59:23-1:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:59:23):**  I would say that I'm in that in between half generation in between, what is it? Z and  millennial. So, I grew up with the Apple II. I grew up with the internet. Like, I had an  analog childhood. And I grew up with computers in the digital age. Like, you know, I grew up  
**[1:59:49-2:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=1:59:49):**  having to learn MS-DOS and programming in basic on an Apple II or an Apple IIGS, you know, playing  Oregon Trail. I remember, you know, I remember Windows 3.11 before World Wide Web was out there.  I remember having to call into AOL. And, you know, we're so spoiled now with Google at our  
**[2:00:10-2:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:00:10):**  fingertips and a supercomputer with, you know, 4k screens that will fit in your pocket. Like,  20 years ago, that would just absolutely have blown my mind. I mean, the first I was thinking  back to my first quote smartphone. It was like a 2.1 megapixel camera on it. And I can send emails  
**[2:00:31-2:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:00:31):**  from it, you know, but T9 word. And I remember that was such a cool thing because I could  go to a boat. I could, you know, I could, this is when I was in the Navy on short duty. So,  I could go to the boat that I was supposed to be working on. Like, okay, I'm reading the work  
**[2:00:47-2:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:00:47):**  package. Well, conditions on site aren't what work package says they're supposed to be.  Right. Well, I could either take some pictures and send them to the boss over email and get an  answer on what to do in five or 10 minutes. Or I could just sit there and look at this,  
**[2:01:05-2:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:01:05):**  look at the job package, drive all the way back to shop. I have to talk to them, drag them all  the way back out to the boat. They look at it, then we go back to shop, we talk about what to do,  then I go back to the boat working on it. It started to save so much time. So, like,  
**[2:01:18-2:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:01:18):**  leveraging early technologies like that was a lot of fun, was profitable or productive. And I  have no idea where I was going with that story. Well, no, we were just talking about where you  grew up in technology. And I was trying to think about where you were in a generation. I feel like  
**[2:01:34-2:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:01:34):**  a bit lost generationally. But I feel like I've got a foot in both worlds still. Like,  that's what I feel like. Like, I'm definitely not a boomer. But I still have, I'm still kind  of in touch with, you know, the folks that are right now going to be in their late 40s.  
**[2:01:53-2:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:01:53):**  That, you know, that are on social media that are really resistant that, you know, that didn't rack  up a bunch of debt by going to college. And then on the other hand, you've got guys that are, you  know, in their late 30s. Yep. Yep. That have always had computers. And that have always,  
**[2:02:08-2:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:02:08):**  that have almost always had, you know, at least World Wide Web, if not smartphones. And  it's just, it's two different generations. That's kind of, it's kind of wild being in  the middle of it. Yeah. Yeah. No, I just think it's, I think it's,  
**[2:02:27-2:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:02:27):**  I am an optimist. And I'm going to continue that mindset, Brian. And I, I, a couple of the things  I dislike about the current cattle industry is, is it's very close minded. It's very traditional.  It's very, this is how we do it. And, and very close to new things, new ideas. I mean,  
**[2:02:49-2:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:02:49):**  for goodness sakes, they ran Alan Savory out of the country on a rope, you know, and, and,  and, and, and he was only wrong on one thing. And to be fair, that was almost 40 years ago.  It was 40 years ago. But if you still mention his name to people who've never heard of anything  
**[2:03:06-2:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:03:06):**  else, they've probably heard of that and they, they will resonate anti, and that's bad. Like  that's, that's, that's terrible. And so what I'm saying is, I don't think the generations that are  coming into the work that are in the workforce now and are, are starting to get the wealth.  
**[2:03:22-2:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:03:22):**  That's the millennials that's generation X and, and, or Y or whatever they call it.  The one after the boomers that I just am saying the blanket statement, I know how I feel. I know,  I think I know how you feel. We don't have time to mess with all the things that are on this  
**[2:03:41-2:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:03:41):**  created cycle now. So I'm excited for where it's headed. That's, that's all that say that I am an  optimist. I'm excited for where it's headed. I think we're going to have good times in the next  30 years. I think there's going to be a huge changing in the guards and changing of the hands.  
**[2:03:54-2:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:03:54):**  And I would say that the people that are pretty stuck in their old ways are going to be in trouble.  Those who are willing to adapt and learn there's different levels of that. If, if, you know,  Warren buffet doesn't move his ship very quick. And, and, and so that's okay. And so for people  
**[2:04:12-2:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:04:12):**  that are pretty financially invested in land that, that maybe, maybe they are running under  different economics than I'm running under. I respect that. And they're late, you know,  they're phase three businesses. That's okay. That ship could be righted, but they do have to be  
**[2:04:27-2:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:04:27):**  willing to change. If an enterprise hasn't worked for three years straight and, and down to the  bootstrap person, we don't have time for having one year that's unprofitable. So our operation  is going to look wildly different from, from somebody else's operation. Who's in it. There's  
**[2:04:42-2:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:04:42):**  a whole range there of people that can be successful. What is not successful is digging in  your heels and saying, I'm going to do this the same way. It just, it just, it hasn't worked for  20 years. It's going to work way worse the next 20 years. In fact, you'll be out of business.  
**[2:04:56-2:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:04:56):**  So, yeah. And the guys that don't cheat, the guys that are even now still saying, well,  this is how we've always done it. You know, and they're being defensive when you start asking  them probing questions about, you know, well, why do you feed hay for 270 days a year in Southwest  
**[2:05:13-2:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:05:13):**  Nebraska? You know, why does that make sense for you? I think we're right on the edge  of fundamental change in all aspects of agriculture and food production. Like,  we're right there. And I think when the change happens, I think it's going to happen fast. And  
**[2:05:37-2:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:05:37):**  it's an excellent point you just made about keeping your business flexible and able to respond and  able to change. And that's what's going to set the operators apart that are ranching  in 2032 from the ranchers that are ranching in 2022. Absolutely. Yeah. Buddy, this has been an  
**[2:05:59-2:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:05:59):**  absolute blast. Well, thank you. It's been fun. Yeah. Yeah. We've busted the two hour mark. Not  that that really means a damn thing in the world. But I know you got to get back on the road. And  I don't want to detain you on the side of the highway in Southwest Nebraska any longer than I  
**[2:06:14-2:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:06:14):**  have to. I've actually... Well, it's not a detainment. It's the speed of my day. I've been  watching the windows behind you, just waiting for a county sheriff or a highway patrol to roll up on  you just to check and see if you're okay. Or even somebody else, you know, with a cake feeder or a  
**[2:06:32-2:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:06:32):**  bail bed on the back just to roll up and be like, hey, man, you good? Because if I saw somebody was  out parked along the highway on my ranch with a stock trailer with cattle in it for two hours,  you bet your ass I would have driven by and made sure they were okay. Yeah. Yeah. I would. That's  
**[2:06:51-2:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:06:51):**  the era we live in where most people come by and they, oh, he's just on the phone.  I do that. I mean, drive up, slow roll up. If I see they got a Bluetooth on, they're holding their  phone, I'll just kind of come up next to the window and wave and cruise right on by. And that's  
**[2:07:07-2:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:07:07):**  usually what it is lately. So. Yup. Yup. Oh, it's been fun, Brian. Well, I always get a lot out of  it hearing you talk and it's really healthy conversation. I'd talk to you anytime. I hope we  could help some listener out there. Just want to encourage everybody to give her a good shot.  
**[2:07:24-2:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/88-Sage-Askin-e1ptmd9#t=2:07:24):**  You'll make her. So. Good stuff. Well, thanks, Sage. Thank you. I'll let you get back to the  road. All right. Take care. Yep. You too. And everybody have a great week. Take care.  This episode has been sponsored by C90 Ocean Minerals. Visit C90.com to find a distributor

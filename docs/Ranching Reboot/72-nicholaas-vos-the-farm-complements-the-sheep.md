Maybe a little bit of a lightning rod, maybe a little bit of a firebrand, maybe a little  bit outspoken.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:01:20):**  But he's somebody that wasn't born on this continent.  So all the way from South Africa, joining me today in the studio in Pratt, Kansas with  my better half Tanya is Nicholas Voss.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome Nicholas.  Thank you.  So you're obviously not in South Africa.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:01:38):**  Where are you at these days?  We're in Stevens County, Kansas.  We landed there, well first time 2001 and then 2006 we kind of moved there second time.  
**[0:01:51-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:01:51):**  We farmed there, kids go to school there and I guess that's where we call home.  Okay.  Now I am only about 95% familiar with Kansas geography.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:02):**  Stevens County, that's like your Southwest corner, right?  It's the second most Southwest County.  Okay.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:09):**  I think Morton County is two hour west and that would be the Elkhart County.  So we're the second one.  Okay.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:15):**  Good stuff.  What's the county seat in your county?  Like the main city?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:20):**  You get in.  Okay.  That's helpful.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:23):**  That's where the kids go to school.  Cool.  Okay.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:26):**  So you've only been here 16 years?  Yes.  I think this would be 16 years this year.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:35):**  First time we came here was 2001.  They didn't quite turn out, well several hiccups and then 2006 our green cards came, got approved  in April and we moved here in June.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:47):**  Well since I already gave it away, you are a South African native?  Yes.  Born and bred there.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:02:53):**  Moved here like I said 2006, became citizen 2011.  Okay.  So tell me about South Africa.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:02):**  Boy.  Okay.  Tell me about your life in South Africa.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:07):**  Were you like farmer rancher in South Africa?  Yes.  I grew up on a farm.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:11):**  Actually grew up on a ranch, mostly cattle farm.  Turned a little bit to a vegetable farm half and half.  A bit halfway through my elementary school.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:22):**  And then we moved to another place right on the border with Zimbabwe on the Nipopa River  in 2000 and what's it 1984?  I'm in the 2000s.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:32):**  And that would be northwest?  That's the northern part of South Africa which is the border to Zimbabwe.  And we were east of a town called Messina where I got raised pretty much after this  
**[0:03:46-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:03:46):**  was when I was 12.  Then raised vegetables there.  It was the time also where South Africa pulled out from Angola, the Anglo war what they called  
**[0:04:00-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:00):**  it or the Angola border war.  And so we had I don't know if you can call it insurgents but we had terrorist attacks  on the farmhouses and farms at the time.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:11):**  There was times where we woke up and there was land mines on the road so we can pick  us up with helicopters.  That's intense.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:18):**  Yes that's kind of how we grew up.  And so you know I still paranoid at some times when loud banks lands off you know hit the  deck kind of something like that.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:26):**  It's just you know it's hard to get that out.  You mentioned military area earlier.  It's tough to get those habits out.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:32):**  I still have more than one that I wish I didn't.  You know situational awareness.  I'm still you know I walk in the mall and I look at suspects as far as I walk and it's  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:40):**  just like something that you're not going to get out of here.  Exits and yes.  Where do you go?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:46):**  What happens?  Anyway but yeah that's that's how I grew up and graduated from school.  Went to a VOTAC and did my apprenticeship through the Air Force and aircraft mechanic  
**[0:04:58-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:04:58):**  and worked on the radar group.  South African Air Force.  And then joined what they call their the commandos which is like the National Guard here.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:07):**  And I was part of that since 2004 when they disbanded it.  When you say commandos people think like Army Rangers, Delta Force, and Navy Seals.  This is more like National Guard.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:16):**  We did like 30 to 90 days a year.  You can sign up for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.  It's all voluntary.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:23):**  But that's what was more of community policing is you know keeping the community safe.  Do patrols and stuff like that on the border weekends.  We do helicopter trips and control the border and stuff like that.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:35):**  Go rescue farmers that were trapped in their house because of land mines on the road.  We did that and you know we had some floods and we'd occasionally take the boat out and  go rescue people stuff like that.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:45):**  But yeah it's I mean it's it's farming.  I mean that's just pretty much farming in South Africa.  It's probably one of the most endangered or one of the most dangerous jobs in the world  
**[0:05:54-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:05:54):**  right now is being a farmer in South Africa.  I think being a farmer in general is always on the top 10 list of most dangerous occupations  anywhere.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:06:03):**  I would agree with that.  I think it's like farmer, rancher, logger, fisherman, construction worker are kind of  like the top five.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:06:12):**  I had a friend always told me there was only three original jobs ever since the Bible time  and those were farmers, soldiers, and prostitutes.  Everything else came came along but those were the original three jobs.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:06:25):**  Yeah yeah I mean they do say the prostitution is the world's oldest profession.  Maybe it's farming.  Maybe they have a point.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:06:34):**  We should probably not continue on this subject.  So how did you get from that to coming here in 2001 and then coming back here in 2006?  So we had floods in 2000 that was my third year farming as a beginner farmer there and  
**[0:06:52-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:06:52):**  we had floods that they called the centennial floods.  I mean it's like every hundred year you have floods and we I mean we got our butts kicked  and so we were looking for I mean the farm was in trouble financially.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:07:04):**  We were looking for another option and at the time farmland industries advertised in  the what they call the farmers journal there or farmers weekly and they were looking for  South African help and so we applied and got the interview and actually flew here to Kansas  
**[0:07:20-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:07:20):**  City and got the interview and got the job at their fancy new headquarters in Kansas  City and farmland industries I mean they were all the co-ops were part of them and so we  got hired by them and that's how we ended up where we ended up because we got a choice  
**[0:07:37-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:07:37):**  between I think North Dakota, Burlington, Colorado and Perryton, Texas and my wife's  like a lizard she likes the heat and so we picked Perryton, Texas and that was the most  southern most heat we could find and that's the elevator where we ended up is called Prairie  
**[0:07:54-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:07:54):**  Ola and that's just a half mile from where we live now that's where we ended up.  I was customs prayer and she was the scale lady at the elevator and that's how we started  here in 2001 in April.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:08:05):**  Okay as a custom sprayer.  Yep and then that was April July farmland industries followed chapter 11 and so we were  without employer that we just I mean literally just got hired and then they decided they  
**[0:08:20-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:08:20):**  no longer needed us so long story short.  What did that do to your visa status?  Well that the visa status just pretty much went into this first part of the visa status  
**[0:08:31-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:08:31):**  is like the lawyers didn't want to carry on with converting the visa to a work visa.  The second part of it is 9-11 happened and they shut down the visa system same year.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:08:42):**  So we got a double whammy that year and we did happen that year and so we decided we  were I mean literally watching and listening to that on the radio that morning and so anyway  we came back to South Africa we didn't want to stay illegally and we decided to go back  
**[0:08:58-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:08:58):**  so that end of that year we actually went back to South Africa and the gentleman that  I had hired rented a house from at the time I would help him after hours you know get  done from the co-op we'd become friends and he offered to sponsor us through employment  
**[0:09:15-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:09:15):**  to come back and that took about five years and in June of 2006 we got our green cards  approved and came back.  Awesome and he sponsored you guys through that that's really cool.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:09:27):**  You want to like give him a shout out or anything over here?  Yes we actually worked there from 2006 till 2007 and he offered us a partnership and we  were partners there till 2014 and we just decided to go our own way for several reasons  
**[0:09:45-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:09:45):**  and in 2014 is when we pretty much became first generation farmers.  That's cool I mean you don't hear very many people like immigrating to this country and  being a first generation farmer anymore I guess it's starting to be more common people  
**[0:10:00-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:10:00):**  are trying to you know not just immigrate but you know trying to leave cities and you  don't do what you've done.  So I guess what is it that you have done in the last 16 years in Stevens County Kansas?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:10:13):**  Well after we quit in 1415 we took on some rental ground and we owned one actually two  quarters at the time and we had been given more rental ground and kind of you know started  out the path that I told you is like you know try and get some scale try and get some numbers  
**[0:10:35-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:10:35):**  and in the first three years we never got a rain down where we where we got the the  land in the panhandle and you know lost quite a bit of money in first three years and we  decided you know that it's kind of a different deal and so we gave some back and kind of  
**[0:10:51-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:10:51):**  halfened our acres to try and concentrate better on what we had and actually had an  opportunity to buy one of those quarters and that's how we kind of you know started working  or started establishing ourselves in the panhandle with the sheep herd too.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:11:06):**  And that was say around 2014-2015?  2016 is when she bought the sheep.  Okay so what did the operation look like before she bought the sheep?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:11:16):**  We were a typical do it all the K-State way of doing fallow, doing the chemical, doing  the fertilizer, strip tilling everything.  I mean we're trying to do everything like everyone else is doing it pretty much.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:11:32):**  You were a farmer.  We were a farmer like everyone else.  The only difference is we were the smallest one around and so you know the economies of  
**[0:11:42-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:11:42):**  scale really hurt us at that time because one if you if you know there's so many things  I mean when you start as a beginner farmer I mean USDA can come with all their bullshit  from start to finish about how they help young farmers and beginner farmers and really there's  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:11:59):**  nothing.  Well first they tell you they give you a T yield which is two-thirds of the county yield  and then and then you get insurance which is 75% of that.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:12:08):**  You do the math so you know you start off with it like a 50% guarantee of all the neighbors.  So you're trying to do a crop and raise a crop well you can only spend 50% if you want  to do risk management you can only spend half what your neighbors spend and still try and  
**[0:12:24-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:12:24):**  raise the same crop.  Well if you get held out which we got held out the first year you got twice in that field  of what you can return on it and you get your ass whipped.

We've started down this cover crop path probably six years ago.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:12:44):**  We already down in this regenerative direction of trying to you know get less inputs be more  of a price maker.  I mean trying to find some niches that can set a smaller guy apart because obviously  
**[0:12:58-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:12:58):**  the status quo as a smaller farmer which was a huge trying to think learning curve for  me going from a 16,000 acre farmer to a 1,000 acre farmer.  Talk about having your head examined.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:13:12):**  It was one I knew I never wanted to farm that many acres again but two trying to make the  the math and the financials work on that smaller scale was really tough especially without  an you know off-farm job.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:13:25):**  And so in 14 when we started or in 15 we did have a cover crop dealership that we started  and we also did have a cash crop dealership with AgVenture that we started.  And those two fortunately took off for us and we made those work where it really helped  
**[0:13:41-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:13:41):**  the farm develop over the next over the last six years really.  And so you know now we've to the point where the farm is both equity and balance and income  everything matches the other two income streams where the other two income streams can really  
**[0:13:56-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:13:56):**  start and look after themselves instead of carrying the farm.  So it's to a point now where we the last two years really is where the farming side has  been enjoyable actually because we don't just you know drain everyone else to keep it afloat  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:10):**  that it's actually carrying itself.  You leaned on your other two businesses for the first several years to kind of support  the changes you were making on your land.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:19):**  Absolutely.  And any beginner farmer young farmer making it any other way because the support from  any farming institutions just not there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:28):**  I mean like they can blow steam all they want to but it's just not there.  It's an interesting perspective to take from a lot of people going like you said to having  an off-farm job looking at that as the way to support.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:39):**  And it seems like you guys looked at the resource the resources you had on farm already and  figured out how to turn that into or the needs you had on farm already and to turn that into  part of your income stream instead.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:50):**  Yes.  And in 2016 I've mentioned we went you know to more sheep and kind of the trigger that  started that is.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:14:56):**  Hold on.  Go ahead.  You got to tell us the story about you and your wife and the sheep.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:02):**  Okay she's going to be mad at me but that's all right.  So sometime in 2016 she had a savings account with some money in it and she got home and  she was all excited and the interest was like a hundred bucks.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:16):**  And it was one of those perfect Southwest Kansas days where it's 100 degrees and 40  mile winds and just damn miserable outside.  Lovely weather.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:25):**  Yes lovely weather.  So I come in and I'm an asshole you know just by nature coming out of the wind and just  miserable and she was still working in town at the time.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:36):**  And so she comes out of her cushy AC office and I've been outside the whole day and I  just want to be inside.  I just want to be left alone throw myself a brandy go in the basement and just not listen  
**[0:15:47-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:47):**  to the wind anymore.  And she comes all excited telling me about her savings account with this money in it  and I just happened to be a red pen just scratch all over her little sheet about you know she's  
**[0:15:58-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:15:58):**  wasting her time and it's a waste of money and just you know she can buy this many ewes  and we had sheep for the last 10 years then you know we consume them on our own property  pretty well and we love sheep and we love lamb chops and ribs and we cook them a lot.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:16:12):**  But anyway so I explained to her that there's a lot better return on income if she does  she well the next day she came back and she had clean plant closed account brought all  the money home and she's like where are we buying sheep and I'm like I'm so screwed.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:16:29):**  That's kind of how that journey started.  I love the story so much because I can see it happening.  You know that's that's so that's when the commercial side of the sheep started up until  
**[0:16:37-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:16:37):**  then we have had 2030 ahead but nothing commercial.  And so in 2016 we started with the sheep and she's I mean she takes care of them and everything  but I met in the same year I met a guy who owned a packer in Goldthwaite, Texas and his  
**[0:16:58-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:16:58):**  name was Craig Jones and we met up at a field day or a seminar up in Salina, Kansas where  I presented on soil health and cover crops and the owner of Craig Jones was there and  after the deal he came to me and he's like man it's like we got a visit we got to connect  
**[0:17:15-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:17:15):**  and I was like what he's like well he's like we pack we pack lamb chops for whole foods  he's like man this story would be so good he said everything we do is already you know  this way it's like imagine if we can just combine the two and combine regenerative ag  
**[0:17:30-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:17:30):**  with the whole sheep ranching side.  Well that was a journey we started in 2016 with Craig and you know three years later  he passed away.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:17:43):**  I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you need a minute?  That's okay.  
**[0:17:48-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:17:48):**  That's if you need a minute take a minute.  It's a sad deal because he passed away in 2019.  A week before he passed we had won the regenerative producer for the year at Whole Foods.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:18:12):**  I like to tell the story because Craig's one of those guys that saw the vision long before  anyone else and he was a great friend but he was never there to receive the award so  anyway that's how we got into the production side of sheep because we had connected with  
**[0:18:31-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:18:31):**  him and we started raising sheep for him so that's how we got into the gap certification  that I told you about and that's what led us down the path of raising sheep in a regenerative  way.  
**[0:18:45-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:18:45):**  We had always had the sheep and we had always done the grazing and stuff but we'd never  thought about combining the actual farming side of it with the sheep side of it.  So from that time in 2018 the two quarters or the three quarters that I told you that  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:05):**  we had the chance to farm one of the landlords offered to sell it to us so we bought the  one quarter.  She actually bought it.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:11):**  It was another FSA screw up totally from the start.  They wanted her to apply because she was previously disadvantaged or whatever the political bullshit  is that they used for guys that...  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:27):**  Some protected minority class.  Yeah.  Anyway so she applied for that.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:31):**  Well they wanted her to have an LLC in her own name and everything to do this project  because she could get special rates and special terms.  Well she did all that.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:40):**  She went through all the bullshit to do her own LLC and everything, do it separate.  She applied and they rejected her because she doesn't have the experience.  And I'm like she's married to someone that has had 20 years of irrigation experience.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:19:56):**  Well now that doesn't count because she's on her own on this new LLC.  And I'm like you've got to be kidding me.  You make her do that just to reject her on the premise that she can't use me because  
**[0:20:07-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:07):**  we're not together.  And so that was the last I used my local FSA office to be exact.  And anyway so the sheep deal then started.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:17):**  She bought that quarter in 2018 in Texas County, Oklahoma.  And we started off by fencing 40 acres.  We took the quarter with the 40 with the most pine weed and that's where we started.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:29):**  And then we fenced 40 every year from there on.  And last year we actually added fence.  We actually did it four 40s in three years because it's just me and her.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:38):**  And fencing I don't care who tells you it's freaking hard work.  Oh yeah.  Especially building net fence.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:43):**  I mean it is a pain in the ass.  But anyway we got it built.  We got shelters in the middle.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:49):**  And this is permanent net fence.  This is permanent net fence.  At the time about $14,000 for a mile.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:20:56):**  So about $30,000 for the quarter.  Which you know that's an investment.  Again you know we're shooting you're in several different directions.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:05):**  But we talked about financing earlier.  You know.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:09):**  No big lending corporation USDA, FSA, farm credit.  None of them want to look at that because it's not in their little guidelines at seven  pages long or seven lines long that tells you you got to be you know have a corn yield.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:22):**  You have that basis and that basis.  They don't want to lend you money for sheep because they have no idea what it's about.  They don't want to lend money for water improvements either.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:29):**  If it wasn't for our small local bank I mean we would still be where we were five, six,  seven years ago.  They have been awesome to work with.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:38):**  And you know shout out to Shannon at First National.  I mean they've been you know great to work with us.  But anyway so we started working down this path and then you know we got the drought  
**[0:21:50-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:21:50):**  I mean which is every freaking year in southeast Kansas seems like it's a drought here.  And so we got through this drought and you know me and my wife's like we got to do better  than that.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:00):**  And so we went and borrowed money, drilled a well and put up a pivot and started dividing  this pivot into the well the full 40s was already there so we put the pivot in the middle  which we had really designed to do that.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:13):**  I mean we built the pins even so that they wouldn't touch the first tower.  You know everything was measured.  Well my irrigation guy and I came up and we got a bed and after we got the well done we  
**[0:22:26-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:26):**  put the pivot up and it was conservation pivot you know.  We were trying to do the right thing here, go with conservation and the drops are like  a foot from the ground and we're like neat this is going to be so cool.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:38):**  So we started the thing and the whole freaking drops of every tower hooked onto the four  foot fence because no dumb ass realized that you can't have foots you know drops a foot  off the ground if the fence is four foot tall.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:50):**  So you know that's like something I'd do.  Oh my gosh.  Every little detail I know it's like it's like it's like you know you do this whole  
**[0:22:59-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:22:59):**  project and everything is planned for and then you're like how the hell are you going  to do this.  And I was like dude this ain't going to work.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:23:08):**  He's like what?  And he just like and I'm like yeah.  It's like it's like OK I'm going to change it but you better be fucking sure because  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:23:17):**  it's once.  I'm going to change it once.  I said OK.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:23:22):**  So he came back no cost no charge and he changed it for me and cut it all straight off.  Well we started to pivot and realized that with water in it the straight cut ones are  suddenly dragging in the middle.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:23:37):**  So we had about 30 or 40 drops in the middle of every tower still hooking on.  So we're like shit we ain't going to call Jonathan because he told me he's doing this  once.  
**[0:23:47-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:23:47):**  So my brother had a brainwave.  He's like well if we can't do that we'll just cut the fence.  So pretty much was it a half mile a mile of fence in four different directions we cut  
**[0:24:00-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:24:00):**  from a four foot to a three foot to make this pivot across the stupid fence.  Well long story short now it runs across and you know we cut holes in with the towers came  through and we got all kinds of gadgets where it goes through to try and figure out how  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:24:16):**  we can keep the sheep in.  But they figured out a way to get out no matter what.  At least the pivot can water every 30 now as it goes around.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:24:24):**  I'm going to have to you've just hooked me into a tour now like 100 percent you've hooked  me into a tour to come out and see how you have a pivot fenced into quarters and the  pivot can go around and the sheep don't get through.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:24:38):**  I've been on there I've been on that all day.  It's a pain in the butt but it's really cool.  And once we figure it out like you know we keep doing different things to figure out  
**[0:24:48-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:24:48):**  what they've done.  So my fence supplier is a place called S&S in Goldthwaite, Texas.  They have by far the best and the cheapest and the most range of fencing material that  
**[0:25:02-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:02):**  I have seen and they're in sheep country so you know they know what they're doing.  And so I'm down there delivering seed.  I go stop by and talk to Ed.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:11):**  I'm like he's got like a RTV or ATV ramp up front that's it's called a cattle guard like  you would use but it's like an uphill deal.  And so you put it in your and they drive over the electric fence.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:22):**  And I'm like so I'm like man this should work to get the pivot across because I sold this  down at a farm and a farmer and I'm like but he built it out of pipe and I'm like he's  weighs probably three tons and you know I don't have the money to buy that much pipe  
**[0:25:35-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:35):**  and I'm asking how much does he and he's like well it's about a thousand bucks.  I'm like that's twenty eight thousand dollars for four corners for four seven towers.  So he's like okay I said what if we make it smaller take half the material out do this  
**[0:25:49-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:49):**  and this and this and he's like it's like 460.  I'm like make me one.  So he takes the measurements makes me one we tried to make man this is going to work.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:25:58):**  So we order like at the time 14 of it 13 more.  So we come and we put it on put it on and I mean everything slick as hell.  It worked really good till the sheep ran out of food and they just walked through it like  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:13):**  if you've seen ever seen a basketball kid doing a ladder on the ground with a you know  tippy toe tippy toe tippy toe.  That's what the sheep looked like running through this thing.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:21):**  I mean it's like I mean five seconds they're all through and when one goes through it's  like man and like 20 follows.  So we're like okay shit that's not going to work.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:31):**  So then we put a like a panel on top.  Well that works but now you've got to undo the thing every time the pivot comes around.  Well then I'm at a rancher down in Texas and he's like what have you take conveyor and  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:43):**  put conveyor on on top of that.  And I'm like you know what.  So that's our next challenge is trying to find some conveyor and put some conveyor on  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:50):**  top of that thing and see because you can't just put a like a gate.  A lot of guys use a swing gate.  That will work.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:26:58):**  No sheep are up.  They're up against every freaking thing they can find.  So they go down the fence they're up.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:03):**  Well here's the gate.  Oh it opens.  Oh I've opened the gate.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:07):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  And they have a memory like an elephant.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:10):**  I mean they can remember exactly what they did.  They are pretty smart when it comes to getting what they want.  They're smart but boy they're we won't get into politics but they're very once you get  
**[0:27:23-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:23):**  them once you get them used to something they're pretty like demanding like they want it again.  So it's like this you know the whole thing don't feed the animals blah blah blah.  Right.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:36):**  It's like the same thing.  Once sheep gets used to something they really expect it.  Yeah when I walk out the door if you my chickens at night I can't open the door unless I have  
**[0:27:43-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:43):**  the food in my hand or else they come inside because they know where the food is.  I can't even walk around our yard in the evenings without the chickens following me around before  you feed them.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:53):**  That's Mariah's fault.  Thanks Mariah.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:56):**  She's the one who trained them.  My chickens didn't do that.  Yeah well that's a good point.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:27:59):**  Anyway we lost sidetrack but.  While I'm thinking about it I might be able to hook you up with some used conveyor.  Yes that'd be awesome.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:06):**  Find me when we're on our way out of here because you know you know where the place  is right.  OK.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:11):**  Yeah.  I kind of forgot where we were.  So sheep 2019 pre-Covid.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:18):**  That's where we were.  It was pre-Covid.  Yeah we were we were essential group.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:21):**  You remember those fancy words you know we were essential.  You were essential.  So we were we were special.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:27):**  We were essential and we just kept working.  You got to leave home.  Pretty much everyone in southwest Kansas were essential and special for the because we never  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:35):**  realized anything happened till we went to town and you know looked like a whole bunch  of ninjas walking around.  What are you people doing wearing masks over there.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:43):**  I know it's like you know people in there by themselves in their own car wearing a mask  and I'm like you just can't fix you but you know you can try with a break or at least  two by two.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:28:54):**  Town full and in does.  But it just you know you can make this stuff up.  But anyway so we never really I mean we went to basketball games and you know did the whole  
**[0:29:03-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:03):**  mass thing to try and you know see the kids playing stuff but didn't even require masks  on their kids.  Did they know most of the time they did and we were you know most of the small communities  
**[0:29:13-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:13):**  were pretty pretty good buy in some of them you know got carried away a little bit.  But you know we went through the whole COVID deal pretty much.  And I don't know.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:23):**  You don't feel like it affected you.  No I don't think it really did marketing.  I know it did your marketing.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:29):**  Marketing you know I think lamp sales went up big time we talked about it.  I think millennials finally found out that you know hair sheep or lamb or meat sheep  is really good and tasty and nutritious and you know they were the only generation that  
**[0:29:43-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:43):**  actually really reached the label on the back of a packet of food and stuff.  And so they're pretty picky about what they buy.  And that's been our biggest market in growth in the lamb industry.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:29:54):**  Not the whole aisle not the kosher not the Hispanics.  Oh I would say you know the ethnic market the Muslim and specifically market is being  strong and growing.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:09):**  That's been constant.  I don't think that's a sudden spike.  I think that's been a very strong growth in the market.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:14):**  Yes but but I don't think that's the the spike.  I think the spike came from the millennials and you know their demand and they like to  have homegrown USA grown stuff and that's the market we're in and that's a market our  
**[0:30:30-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:30):**  packer is in.  So do you think that's a short term thing or do you think that that trend is going to  continue and an increase or even spread to other meat sectors?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:41):**  I think it's on the increase.  I don't think that demand is a short term.  I don't know if the beef guys are going to pull it off.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:49):**  You're a beef guy.  I don't know if you have the numbers on the balls to pull it off against the packers but  I see lawsuits and stuff happening every time but I don't truly see a paradigm shift in  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:30:59):**  the beef industry.  I mean do you?  It's going to be tough.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:31:04):**  I mean we're at the point with the beef industry and the packing industry that it's one of  those too big to fail.  That's where I'm getting at.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:31:12):**  I mean we can sit here and some of us may come out and yell over the next little bit  about energy use to raise protein and how sustainable that is.  At the end of the day, we're looking down the barrel of $5 farm fuel, increasing fertilizer  
**[0:31:30-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:31:30):**  prices.  Our cattle prices, they're not where they should be for the input costs.  Absolutely they're not there.  
**[0:31:40-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:31:40):**  And I guess what I'm getting at is the fundamental flaw in our economic system is the energy  conversion ratio between forms of energy and food.  Takes too much energy to produce food.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:00):**  And the books won't balance and they can't balance.  A system like what you're running where you're running cover crops and sheep and marketing  those sheep to people that want to know where they come from, that's a lower energy budget  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:17):**  than the typical commodity feedlot cow.  Absolutely.  And I don't know where I'm at on that energy budget scale.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:24):**  I'd like to think I'm pretty close to the low end because of how I run my cows and my  winter feeding program and how they graze all year.  Things just aren't going to be, things are going to have to change.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:40):**  Is the whole paradigm going to change?  Is the whole industry going to change overnight?  No.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:44):**  Feedlots are not going away overnight.  No matter how gross they are and how much some people hate them and don't like them,  they're not going to go away overnight.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:52):**  They're not going to stop buying corn.  They're not going to stop feeding the DDG.  They're just not going to go away.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:32:57):**  Maybe eventually they will go away over time.  They're not building very many new ones.  They're not building extra new feedlots to add more feeding capacity into the system.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:33:09):**  Just like they haven't built a new meat plant in over 20 years.  Why did the big four not build any new meat plants?  They don't have to because they can wait for an event like this to depress cattle prices,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:33:22):**  raise box beef prices, and get a group of guys up in South Dakota to raise over a billion  dollars to build a 3,000 head of day plant that one of them is going to buy at 10 cents  on the dollar within the next 10 years.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:33:34):**  Tell me you don't see that.  Well, that's why I'm kind of throwing the question back at you.  We're pretty fortunate in the sheep industry that the packers really don't have the whole  
**[0:33:43-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:33:43):**  on our pricing that they have on the cow guys.  How?  Because I think, okay, so if you look at historically, and I don't know the history of the US lamb  
**[0:33:55-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:33:55):**  industry that well, but I do know a few things.  One, I think if you look at the white elephant in the room, it's the wool sheep.  No one wants to talk about it.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:34:05):**  A lot of guys that's in the ASI and they're probably not going to like me for this and  they probably don't like me for this already and I don't really care, but there are a lot  of guys are into those instances and they're backing the wool sheep industry because that's  
**[0:34:22-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:34:22):**  what they grew up with.  Well, there's a reason why the lamb industry is so under consumed.  It's because, I mean, wool sheep meat sucks.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:34:33):**  And it doesn't smell that good.  It's a market that is made and bred for the feedlot produced animal.  And it's not what we cater for.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:34:43):**  We cater for a ranch, race, like yourself type animal.  And it's a different market.  It's a different market size animal.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:34:52):**  If you take the ethnic market, it's a smaller carcass.  It's about half the size of what they like.  They can't profitability kill these animals because, you know, we talked about it is the  
**[0:35:02-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:02):**  kill rate is the same, whether it's a 75 pound animal or 140 pound animal.  Just like with cattle, big carcasses make the packer money and smaller carcasses make  the producer money.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:15):**  So what's the pressure in the sheep market holding carcass size down?  The demand.  Because the ethnic, which is the, like I said, it's not the biggest spike in demand right  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:27):**  now, but it's a very steady growth in demand.  But why do they want a smaller sheep?  I guess is what I'm really asking.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:32):**  Because they don't eat the cuts.  They want to cook the whole animal, right?  They want to throw it in the grinder.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:36):**  They take the animal, they chop it up in cubes, and that's what they use.  The whole animal.  And the smaller animal are a more tender, more flavorful animal.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:45):**  And that's what they want.  They want a 25 to 40 pound carcass.  They want the whole animal.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:35:51):**  They chop it up.  If you look at their demand, the things that is usually last on the shelf to sell in an  ethnic shop is the ribs and the lamb chops and stuff like that.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:03):**  Which would be the higher cost.  Exactly.  Which is too expensive.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:07):**  And they don't want it.  They don't have a way to cook it.  And they don't eat grind typically either, right?  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:10):**  No.  It's more like roast.  Yes.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:13):**  Where you look at the millennial and the ground lamb and the lamb chops and the lamb ribs  are the three prime demand things on the millennials.  Which gets rid of the rest of your carcass.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:21):**  Because it's a small portion.  They can go five o'clock and they can go by the grocery store, buy two lamb chops, you  know, cook them, have no waste and be done.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:31):**  They don't keep any, I mean, the millennials don't keep anything in the fridge.  They don't even own a freezer.  So they literally buy what they want to use every day and they don't want to waste.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:40):**  And so that's what's driving this market.  And they want to know where the food comes from.  They have no interest in buying the typical Sam's imported Australian, you know, stuff  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:52):**  that's been on the ship for seven months.  And I don't know.  I'm not going to criticize what I don't know.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:36:57):**  But my point is that's not the market that they support.  They support the local market and the packers have no control over the ethnic market.  They can't afford to get into it because they can't process those small animals at a profit.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:37:10):**  Like you said, the bigger the animal, you know, that's where the margins is.  And so, go ahead.  Do you have any concerns because of the way things are going right now that in our region  
**[0:37:22-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:37:22):**  specifically that there's going to be too many people that decide and realize that raising  sheep is valuable and it's almost in this part of the country more cost effective than  cows?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:37:35):**  Yes and no.  Everyone wants to raise sheep until they have sheep.  And probably everybody wants to raise sheep until they try to get rid of them.  
**[0:37:44-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:37:44):**  There's a huge challenge in raising sheep on a scale way, not in a feedlot.  When you have sheep year-round on any system, I don't care if it's ranch or on, you know,  converted farmland like we do, but you don't realize how much they eat until you got to  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:05):**  feed them.  And they will die.  And you know.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:11):**  I heard they try to die.  Oh, they, you know, they constantly look for them.  They look for an excuse or a place to die.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:17):**  But seriously, I know several people that have gone that believe in the economies of  scale that are big farmers that have taken two, three, four sections and then buy a thousand  head of sheep and suddenly they're going to be sheep farmers.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:30):**  And then three years later, they sell about 300 head, they lost 700, and they're in the  red for that three-year period.  And they don't ever want to do sheep again.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:39):**  So yes, a lot of smaller people are going to get into sheep and a lot of smaller people  are going to find some really good niche markets.  I mean, I'll take an example.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:49):**  There's how many restaurants in Pratt?  I bet you there's not a single one of them that have a single sheep producer contracting.  No, there's no guarantee.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:38:57):**  There's not one in town that sells a sheep product.  Same for Kingman.  See, we go west.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:02):**  There's not even anybody in this town that will sell you a burger that can tell you what  ranch it came off of or what even.  So that's my point is there's a ton of opportunity.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:12):**  I mean, take Wichita, we're an hour and a half from Wichita.  I bet you can have 10 or 15, 500 head size farms just for Wichita to service that town  and not keep up.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:28):**  And the big packers would never notice you were there.  The challenge is creating the market or opening people's eyes to the fact that they want the  product.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:35):**  Yes.  And I think that's where restaurants are.  I think that's that sleeping dog that if when they finally figure out that they can have,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:43):**  I mean, I'll throw out a name.  I mean, AJ up in Burlington, Colorado.  I know who you're talking about.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:47):**  And you know, he produces for the local place there.  I bet he doesn't supply enough for them, but they take everything he has.  And so.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:39:57):**  And if he wants to grow something weird before he plants it, they've already said that they're  going to buy it.  Yes.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:03):**  So I think we need to see more of that in every small town.  Absolutely.  And farmers.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:09):**  So that's a really great point.  There's a there's a restaurant down.  I'm just going to generalize down by Ponca City, Oklahoma, that does this really cool  
**[0:40:17-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:17):**  thing on the weekends where they provide a locally grown meal and you basically buy a  ticket and you come in for the evening and they tell you about where the food came from  and how they cook it and everything.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:29):**  And so we went down last summer and had this meal.  It was a great meal.  But when I finished, I realized that the meal came that the meat from the meal, all the  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:37):**  produce was actually really locally grown.  The eggs were from this really small town.  But the meat was from.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:45):**  Tell me where we talked about this when it happened.  Remember?  No, I really don't.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:49):**  The big farm over by Arc City.  Gosh, Creekstone Creekstone.  Yeah, Creekstone.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:40:56):**  So Walmart, the Walmart farm.  Right.  And so now it was Creekstone.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:00):**  It was something like that.  It was a big.  They got their meat from a big, giant packing plant that was local to them.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:06):**  However, the meat wasn't raised with any sort of consideration compared to anything else.  And this this restaurant was really wanting to provide this experience.  And I think if they had somebody to partner with to sell the experience along with the  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:22):**  animal, along with the rest of the food, that would have been extremely valuable to them.  And I guarantee you the reason that they didn't wasn't because they didn't want to.  They hadn't been approached by anyone.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:30):**  A lot of people think, you know, oh, you know, that's that's a small scale.  We can't do that.  You would be surprised how much produce goes through a restaurant in a month, even a small  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:40):**  town restaurant.  My dad has owned a restaurant for my whole life.  You take a lot of beef.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:45):**  I mean, fries, chickens, anything you can think of, lamb.  You'd be surprised.  And I'm I'm surprised we haven't seen more of these little partnerships.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:41:55):**  And, you know, I had a deal with with a question last week with someone.  And it's like, you know, small beginner farmers.  And I see millennials moving out of the city, starting these things more and more and more.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:10):**  They move out of the city.  They find two, three acres up on the side.  And they absolutely raise animals and vegetables and everything for a single restaurant in  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:18):**  town.  And they make a living.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:21):**  And so possible.  And we've convinced ourselves and we've convinced our kids that it's not a possibility that  you can't make a living, that it's less than if you decide you want to live in a small  
**[0:42:30-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:30):**  community and provide a restaurant with food for your living, like that that's less.  If you go to an upscale restaurant and you know you're going to spend 80, 90, 100 dollars  a plate, that guy can afford to pay that kind of price to the producer that's producing  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:46):**  him that.  It's a win win.  It's a lot like what we were talking about earlier.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:51):**  You're not talking McDonald's.  I mean, you're not going to see a McDonald's lamb burger soon because they can't buy the  junk.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:42:57):**  I mean, unless they import it from Australia and New Zealand.  No, but like a situation like I was talking about earlier where this place sells you a  ticket and you know, maybe you don't even know what you're going to eat, but they provide  
**[0:43:06-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:06):**  you a lamb burger or lamb chop that you've never had before.  You've never tasted it.  Now the first time you taste lamb, it's cooked by someone who knows how to prepare it instead  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:16):**  of your own self at home.  That's lamb.  That's what's lamb.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:19):**  You know, I've cooked lamb to several people and everyone's like, man.  That was good.  We've never had lamb that good.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:23):**  And I'm like, yeah, because people, you know, that cook lamb here, we don't know how to  cook it here because it's not in our culture.  You know, dumb ass 101 trying to cook lamb like you do chicken and stuff.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:32):**  And it's like, it doesn't work like that.  You got to know how to cook it.  I mean, and once you figure out several ways to cook it, it should be part of the weekly  
**[0:43:41-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:41):**  meal deal, you know, with your hamburger, with your beef, it's much more affordable  resource for us to have in this part of the world than beef.  So grass fed lamb is only second to salmon in omega three to six ratios.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:43:56):**  Okay.  That's awesome.  It is the healthiest grass fed rate meat there is.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:02):**  Didn't know that.  And it's probably also the most efficient to grow in the center of the country, right?  I don't know if it's most efficient.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:10):**  Like I said, it's very efficient.  It's way more efficient than beef or chicken.  Profitability, yes.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:15):**  I mean, we're not we're not talking about, you know, how to raise them because they're  tough to raise.  I mean, it's, you know, a lot of people say easy cure this and that.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:23):**  And for the most part, they are.  And we're pretty tough.  We call really hard on our heart too.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:28):**  But you know, they're still tough to raise in the numbers we do to raise 20 sheep is  easy.  Everyone can do it.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:34):**  200 is tough.  2000 is near impossible.  You got to know you got to know what you're doing, or you're gonna have some pretty good  
**[0:44:41-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:41):**  losses.  And that's the reason I think the growth is there, but it's going to be more.  I think we're going to see more 20 people raising, you know, 50 sheep then we're going  
**[0:44:50-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:50):**  to see guys doing which makes the whole system less fragile, right?  How do we how do we repopulate the country?  This is how?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:44:59):**  Yeah, I mean, what what other better way you know, if you get hungry, you find a place  to grow food and you grow it exactly.  You look at waste in Kansas, you know, and and and it's the only people that are really  
**[0:45:12-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:45:12):**  repopulating the country's the Spanish people.  They come in, they buy a quarter, they've divided in full, there's four houses on it.  Every one of those 40s has got the horse, four cows, six goats, chickens, sheep.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:45:26):**  And I mean, tell me how that is not good for waste in Kansas.  It absolutely is good.  Because they're I mean, who else is going to especially if they're learning and I mean,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:45:34):**  they have to take care of their soil when they have a day job.  All of them have a private productive day job.  They come home and they take a quarter that's a low low income quarter.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:45:44):**  They develop it into a you know, multi house, pretty much working little permaculture environment.  I mean, it's I like it.  I mean, it's you look at all the small towns and little houses pop up around, you know,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:45:58):**  you get in hooker, Optima, Guymon, all those areas has got these quarters developing around  town and that's what it is.  And my biggest customer base on the sheep are the Mexican guys.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:46:09):**  Are those guys developing those quarters?  Absolutely.  I mean, I if I've got several guys that buy sheep from me, and word of mouth, you know,  
**[0:46:17-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:46:17):**  we raise tough sheep.  We don't raise show sheep, we don't raise fancy sheep, we raise tough sheep.  And so our customers, you know, when they come back, they're like, man, those are the  
**[0:46:27-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:46:27):**  toughest use we've got all the RAM, you know, toughest RAM.  You know, when we sell stuff, it's it's known for more of a harder environment characteristics.  So you're selling for breeding and genetics as well as for food, you know, growth, growth  
**[0:46:41-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:46:41):**  and toughness.  Because, again, you know, like we, you know, talked on the ranch, if I got a dose one for  four parasites, we're selling him or her.  
**[0:46:50-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:46:50):**  I mean, he's got to be freakin handsome, or she's got to be a breeding factory if we don't  sell otherwise, we fix them up, we get a medicine, we put them in the little corn pen and off  they go.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:02):**  But we got the enough customer base that wants a grain fed animal, even though we're grass  fed operation that we have constantly have three to 10 animals in a corn pen, which we've  grain fed and sell in that environment.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:16):**  So that's what you guys have found for your coals essentially, as you grain finish your  coals instead of babying them and selling them at a feed lot like you would with cows.  If we take them to a feed lot, we're going to get anywhere from 130 to $180 an animal  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:30):**  for a cull ewe.  If we put a cull ewe in the corn pen, she's probably going to dress out 80 pounds at $4  a pound.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:37):**  So double your money.  So we get pretty much double of what a cull animal would bring.  And everyone loves what they're getting.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:45):**  How long does it take to like if you're going to do that, you're going to throw a sheep  in the corn finish, and how long does it stay?  I would say six to eight weeks.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:51):**  Okay.  It's a lot faster than a cow.  Well wait, yeah, I mean, that's why sheep.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:47:55):**  Yeah, usually by eight weeks, they've got a good half inch of fat on them.  So a sheep is going to, what am I trying to say?  So a cow, a bovine converts at about seven to one, like seven pounds to one pound.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:48:10):**  Does a sheep convert around three to one?  I have absolutely no idea what you're referring to.  So you're going to help me.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:48:18):**  It takes seven pounds of corn or seven pounds of forage to put a pound on a cow?  Oh, I got you.  I have absolutely no idea.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:48:26):**  If I was a feedlot guy, I would tell you, but I have no idea.  I have no idea how many pounds of grass it takes on a cow.  We feed them oats and corn, and they got access to water and hay, but we feed them corn and  
**[0:48:38-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:48:38):**  oats for about eight weeks.  And we usually don't do it for the gain because they're already a full grown animal.  So I would have no idea how to put that into gain terms because we don't ever do this with  
**[0:48:50-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:48:50):**  a young animal because our young animals are all raised on non-grains.  And so this would be a mature animal that we're just trying to condition and get some  fat on.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:00):**  Do you do anything different before you send your finished animals off to packing?  Or do they just go straight?  Do they go at a certain time of year?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:09):**  How does that work?  Usually they want them around 100 to 120 pounds.  And so that's anywhere from six to nine months.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:17):**  And so we'll wean them.  If we have forage, we'll put them back on forage.  If we don't have forage, we'll dry lot them, and they'll get a mixture of probably alfalfa  
**[0:49:27-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:27):**  and peas and sunflower and cotton, everything that's considered non-grains and non-cereals.  And we'll finish them on that with hay, obviously.  If we have pasture, they'll be on pasture, obviously, because it's a lot cheaper.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:42):**  Which in southeast Kansas, pasture is like chicken teeth.  I mean, it's like this time of the year, especially.  I mean, we've been bone dry.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:49):**  I mean, you guys have not been much better than we are, but looking at the grasses, you're  a lot greener than we are.  It's so much worse where you guys are.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:49:56):**  It's so much worse.  It's like, Monday, we were, what, 100 and 405, 42 mile winds.  I mean, it takes the two inches of rainfall we had last week.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:05):**  I mean, it's just gone.  And with that being said, it's horrible.  But consider being your neighbors and having the land that they've had that's been treated  
**[0:50:14-0:50:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:14):**  that way for all these years.  Like what you guys are doing makes a huge difference in how tolerant you can be of the  horrible temperatures and weathers out there.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:22):**  I don't know about tolerant.  It's more like, you know, the liquor stores make good money.  That's about it.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:29):**  It just depends if it's, you know, whiskey or vodka or brandy in my instance.  But you know, I think you grow tolerance.  I don't think you have it.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:36):**  And insanity.  I mean, it's like, I don't know how people keep saying out there.  It's like, you know, our plan is to probably, you know, move out south somewhere, Oklahoma  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:45):**  or Texas when the youngest one, which is now seventh grader.  South or east?  South east.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:51):**  East?  It's always east.  I would definitely go east.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:50:54):**  I am so tired of droughts.  You know, where I grew up in South Africa, we were about 12 to 18 inches a year.  But we did not have the wind.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:03):**  We had mountains, we had trees, we had rivers.  We had humidity too, right?  Not much more.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:08):**  I mean, it's more like an Arizona heat and a Florida winter.  Like we were 40 degrees in the winter and about 120 in the summer.  And so it would get really hot but a dry heat, but in the winter it would be 40 degrees.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:21):**  And so we're not, my wife hates snow.  Like I said, she's a lizard, you know.  I don't know if you've seen those desert lizards that stand on two feet and then they swap  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:29):**  the two feet.  That's her half the time.  She loves 100 degree weather.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:32):**  She'd be out in it all the time.  If you go out in the morning, at noon it doesn't feel hot as long as you go out early.  Even in the middle of the day she'll be out.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:39):**  I mean, she looks dark, dark, dark when you see her this time of the year.  And that's just, she's outside all the time, but she can't stand the snow.  I mean, there's a cold front on the TV.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:50):**  She gets goosebumps.  I mean, it's like, I mean, she can't handle the cold.  And so we'd probably go somewhere east and somewhere south where we can bear the humidity  
**[0:51:58-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:51:58):**  and not get as much snow and get 50 inches of rain.  I can't wait for that.  You guys probably are in a really great place to raise your kids.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:06):**  It is a really, really, really good community for raising kids.  I mean, it's been really good for us.  It's been good for the kids.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:14):**  I mean, the kids have done so well.  So I mean, it's been a blessing to be there.  And like I said, if it wasn't for the weather, we'd probably retire there.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:24):**  But the weather is just stupid.  I mean, it's just...  Yeah, I mean, unless you love a desert, you can't wake up and expect the weather every  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:29):**  day to be great because it's a desert.  Even the desert's fine.  But the freaking wind that blows every day.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:34):**  That's a windy desert.  That's the wind for me.  It's just...  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:37):**  It drives me insane.  The sound of it.  Both Brian and I will like halfway through the day when it's windy, we're both just like,  
**[0:52:43-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:43):**  okay, I'm done.  It'll usually blow me right back into the house at about 25 miles an hour.  My office is in my basement.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:49):**  So is his.  Yes.  And I will go straight into my basement and I'll pour myself a brandy and I'm like, fuck  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:56):**  it.  That's it for the day.  I mean, I'm done.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:52:59):**  It just...  You just get to a point where it's like detrimental to your mental health to be outside.  It just, you have to take a break.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:06):**  That's probably why the people that settled this part of the world built houses, like  dug holes in the ground.  I don't blame them.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:12):**  Just as they get out of the wind.  Build your house into a north side of a hill.  We've actually seen dugouts before and I'm like, man, why would you build a dugout into  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:19):**  the north side of the hill?  The wind would blow in there.  Well, gee, many Pete's in the summer, you know why.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:23):**  It's exactly where you'd want to build it with a hole on the south end.  And on the sheep, you know.  We lost, oh, February, March.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:32):**  We probably lost.  Well, I'll tell you this part.  We had about 50 or 60 orphan babies in a month span.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:41):**  This year or last year?  This year.  Okay.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:44):**  When the wind blows, she'll have twins.  She'll get the first one cleaned up.  She'll have the second one.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:51):**  By the time she has the second one, the first one wandered off.  She can't hear him.  He can't hear her.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:53:58):**  And so my wife goes down once a day and she goes down twice a day.  And so she'll get there.  There will be a baby in the corner of the pens or in the corner of the pasture just  
**[0:54:07-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:07):**  laying there half dead because his mom had him and she can't find him because they're  90% sound.  If they can't hear each other, they're screwed.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:15):**  And when the wind's blowing 50 miles an hour, they just can't hear each other.  So every day she'd pick up three or four.  If the wind blows one day a week, she'll have no babies for six days.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:25):**  The day the wind blows, she'll have seven, eight babies.  And so, I mean, she was stressor.  She was, she was, I mean, I met the wind is really bad on her for about, you know, five,  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:35):**  six weeks and then they come up and they're so, you know, they never got the colostrum  they needed.  I mean, and then they're just weak babies.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:42):**  So let me ask the stupid question.  Why are we lambing when it's so cold?  The same question we have with cows.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:48):**  I mean, I'm sure there's a reason.  When do you lamb that the wind don't blow?  There isn't a time that the wind doesn't blow.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:54:56):**  I mean, when the wind's blowing in May.  This was not cold.  I mean, well, honestly, she lambs after spring break.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:04):**  Like she doesn't lamb in the winter at all anymore.  She quits in November and she starts after spring break.  This is after spring break we're talking about.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:13):**  So what's killing them?  The wind.  They just get separated because of wind.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:17):**  It's not separated.  Then they die of hunger.  Then she just can't find them.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:20):**  Okay.  I understand.  It's not a temperature thing.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:23):**  It's a wind thing.  They're starving because they're alone.  Yeah.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:27):**  They can't find their mom.  They're just without food.  And if we want to, the period of time in this area without much wind, like with the least  
**[0:55:37-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:37):**  amount of wind is summer.  So for pretty much now, middle of June as we record this, like might get released in  July or whatever, but middle of June till about September, October even.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:51):**  I don't know.  I would even say.  I've seen the data from the wind farms.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:55:58):**  There's less wind in the summer than any other time of year.  There's more days of less than 10 miles an hour wind in the summer than any other time  of the year.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:08):**  The problem with the lambs is what they call trash lambs.  Anytime you lamb in the summer, the heat just kills them.  They don't grow.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:15):**  That's what I said.  I know there has to be a reason because like with cattle, I know there's a reason.  Normally people used to calve early and now that doesn't necessarily make sense.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:23):**  But I also know that to do with markets has reasons and that there's all kinds of reasons.  So too much heat can clearly be a problem for them as well as too much cold or too much  wind.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:33):**  I know as you go north south on the lambish tree, they change months to fit the market.  We don't have that problem because our market's constant 12 months a year.  So we don't change for that.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:43):**  But we try and do the optimum lambing time and snow and stuff like that is always, you  know, blizzards always keep the lambing in the winter.  And so that's why we go after spring break.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:56:53):**  But you know, when you have the wind like this year, I mean, it's just been terrible.  Yeah, that's an interesting problem that people probably wouldn't think about.  This year has been, I think it has, there's been record windy days, a lot of them out  
**[0:57:06-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:06):**  in Dodge City, like a lot.  Yep.  I was talking to Michael Thompson the other day and he told me that it's like twice as  
**[0:57:15-0:57:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:15):**  much windy days as any year before back to when they started recording over like 30 mile  an hour or something.  I have absolutely no trouble believing that.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:25):**  I think I've also seen where this is like some of the driest period that we've ever  had in this part of the world since we've been starting to keep records.  Yep.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:35):**  Yeah, if it wasn't for, I mean, the last month we've had some moisture, but up until that  time, it's been brutal.  It's been, I mean, I feel that pain.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:46):**  Yeah, it's been brutal.  Yeah, there's a lot of times we got rain that it was like, right, started right past them  too.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:57:53):**  I mean, you could see it out in western Kansas and it was probably building up right over  you guys and not raining.  Yep.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:00):**  And we've had several that, I mean, just 20 miles east of us at Medicine Lodge, I think  they have over three, if not four more inches of rain than we have.  Yep.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:09):**  20 miles away.  Yeah.  It's wild.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:12):**  It's pretty spotty.  It's like big storms in the last month like pop up between us and town.  It is what it is, you know?  
**[0:58:20-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:20):**  It rains on the just and the unjust alike.  Yeah, I got a guy in Texas that I work with that I've been giving him our times.  Like, you know, he's got a fire, his preacher is obviously not working and working for him,  
**[0:58:31-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:31):**  going to the wrong church and just giving him hell.  But he's been one of those that has had less than three inches up in hill country and everyone  around him has had nine, 10 inches.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:40):**  And he's, you know, he's been selling sheep and selling cows and it's like, what else  can you do?  That's about all you can do.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:46):**  So much more.  Okay.  So what kind of sheep do you have?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:50):**  I don't know if you think you've said what breed you have.  So Dorper.  They're, you get the Dorper and White Dorper.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:58:56):**  So Dorper is blackhead, white body, White Dorper is just white sheep.  Okay.  We have the Dorper, which is the blackhead one.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:03):**  And they're the fastest growing breed in the US.  They are a hare sheep.  They are a meat sheep.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:09):**  They are in the top 10.  They pretty much dominate the carcass competitions every year.  Their meat to bone ratio is superior to almost everything else.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:19):**  They're a lot of meat versus the bone.  If you got a 100 pound Dorper is going to have as much meat, give or take as 140 pound  a wool sheep.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:30):**  Really?  Can you explain what hare sheep means?  I know what hare sheep means, but maybe some people don't.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:36):**  They grow hare like wool and they have a thick coat in the winter, but they shed it in the  spring.  In the summer they're bare.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:44):**  They have like a skin like a goat, but they have like a reach back on the top of their  backs that keeps the flies out.  And that's what we call a perfect Dorper because they're, they're all the shed, all the wool  
**[0:59:55-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=0:59:55):**  is shed besides for a little reach on the back and they don't have fly strike when that  happens.  If you got one that's got too much will to overheat, they won't be as fertile.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:00:04):**  They won't take, they won't breed as bad back as good.  And so that's another thing we call for is, is we have some wooly ewes that I call their  hare sheep, but they're a lot more cover.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:00:16):**  And so a Dorper is a mixture between a hare and a wool sheep, but they're, but they're  so they got a wool cover with hare on them, but they'll shed.  And so when they, when they got more of the one trait in them, they'll have more wool  
**[1:00:29-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:00:29):**  and they tend to be, you know, negative, not as fertile.  If they have more hare, they'll get more fly strike, more fly issues, and they'll overheat  too because of that.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:00:40):**  And so you got to have a balance between the two.  And but yeah, they're, they're, they're a sweet, very tender meat, really good tasting,  a very good docile animals.  
**[1:00:52-1:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:00:52):**  They are, they're bred in South Africa, developed in South Africa.  They can withstand.  And I mean, they, they raised a lot of them in the Karoo, which is like New Mexico, pretty  
**[1:01:05-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:05):**  much.  It is just dry.  They're, they're bred for a dry, dry area.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:09):**  They're probably some of the best converters there is, which is another reason they are  very hard to duplicate in a feedlot environment.  Because the moment you put a Dorper in a feedlot environment, they gain kidney fat, internal  
**[1:01:22-1:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:22):**  fats so fast, and then they're not marketable.  Get sick.  Not just, not just sick, but the customer don't want to pay for a 50 pound carcass that  
**[1:01:32-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:32):**  they got to trim 10 pound of fat off.  And so that's what makes them so good on a ranch, on a ranch environment, because you  can literally, you know, have them on hay and they'll be fat.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:45):**  And so that's, that's what makes the Dorpers so unique for our area.  I mean, there's Dorpers in Florida, there's Dorpers in Minnesota, Oregon, California.  I mean, they're in almost all the states here because they're so adaptable.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:01:57):**  Cold, heat, I mean, they just adapt to their environment so well.  And they're, like I said, there's a reason they're the fastest growing breed.  If you look at the markets, curiosity, just interesting.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:02:09):**  You look at San Angelo, you look at Hamilton, you look at Goldthwaite, all the big sale  barns, there will be wool lambs and there'll be Dorper, Dorper cross lambs.  It's the only breed that gets mentioned on any sale barn ticket.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:02:21):**  And so there's a reason for that.  I mean, they are very sought, very sought after, very fast growing breed.  What's the downfall of the breed?  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:02:30):**  What's the...  There's not a lot.  They're expensive.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:02:35):**  They're expensive to get into.  And genetically, the rams is hard to produce a good quality ram.  The ewe and the ewe frame in the US is very much up to date.  
**[1:02:50-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:02:50):**  I think there's some really good productive ewes.  The rams are leap years behind South Africa when it comes to genetic development.  Since you can't bring in anything from South Africa, you can only bring in pretty much  
**[1:03:04-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:04):**  third party embryos and stuff from New Zealand and Australia.  And so, foot and mouth is...  I'm going to have to ask why we can't bring in animals from South Africa.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:18):**  You can bring in animals, but the quarantine, I think, is so tough that you can't do it  profitably.  And I know that the embryo exports is shut down because of foot and mouth and all kind  
**[1:03:30-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:30):**  of regulations.  But the moment we do, there's some breeders like Mickey Phillips, Dorpers, Ash Phillips  is the son.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:38):**  You look at their Dorpers and it's like world class.  I mean, they're the best breeders in the world.  And I would love to get my hands on some of those genetics.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:47):**  And they're South African.  Oh, absolutely.  He's actually going to be here in a month or two judging in Fredericksburg at the Texas  
**[1:03:54-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:03:54):**  Yule Country.  And we bring in South African judges to come and judge some of the local deals.  And it's really good to enforce the standards that way.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:02):**  Have him go collect a couple of straws and just slip them in his wallet.  I've followed him, you know, and I'm trying to go there and bring a ram lamb back as a  support animal and, you know, get him on a plane.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:13):**  They do dogs and cats and stuff, you know, as a support animal.  So I don't see why I can't bring a little sheep over an airplane as a support animal.  Emotional support.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:22):**  Absolutely.  I like where your head's at.  Everything you want to do is illegal?  
**[1:04:25-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:25):**  Screw it.  You can figure out a way.  I mean, you identify as a shepherd.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:32):**  You should be able to have a sheep.  I don't see why he can't identify as a human for the flight.  This is a great point.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:37):**  It is a great point.  I mean, you just get the right flight attendant, right gate agent.  You'd be like, no, he really identifies as a human and really identifies as a non-human.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:47):**  You really offend him if you don't let him on the plane.  Yep.  Boy, we've gone way too far off the deep end with that crap.  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:04:56):**  Yes, we have.  Yeah, we haven't really talked about anything yet.  On your list?  
**[1:05:02-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:02):**  No.  Well, I don't have it.  It's not really much of a list.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:05):**  It's just a couple of notes.  So I know you're itching to talk about it.  Tell me how you feel about ethanol.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:13):**  Oh, you're throwing me in the deep end here.  Yeah, let's just piss everybody off.  Switch gears real quick.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:19):**  We're going to talk about corn and ethanol now.  So if you're easily offended, turn it off.  So I have absolutely nothing against ethanol.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:29):**  We talked about it on the ranch.  Ethanol and the ethanol industry is great.  Just like any other industry, I don't think our tax dollars should pay to make someone  
**[1:05:39-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:39):**  bigger and better, but to everyone on their own.  The biggest thing I have with ethanol is the renewable part.  Up in Iowa, you can call it renewable.  
**[1:05:49-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:05:49):**  In Southwest Kansas, I don't see how you can call it renewable because anytime – and  don't want to sound like a hypocrite because I'm growing corn and it goes to the feedlot.  But I don't call it renewable corn.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:06:02):**  I don't call it renewable feedlots either.  There's nothing wrong with participating in the current system as it exists that we  can acknowledge is screwed up or could be better.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:06:13):**  There's nothing wrong with participating in that system as long as we acknowledge our  part in it and that we're trying to build something better.  We're trying to get out of the cash crop industry.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:06:24):**  I've told you this.  We're trying to get into mostly grazing, perennial grazing forages for the sheep.  Our whole farming system is headed that way and we're using cash crops to support our  
**[1:06:37-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:06:37):**  sheep development and forage-based system development into the point where we can make  it profitable and make the switch.  But until then, we're screwed and we have to do cash crops like sorghums, like corn,  
**[1:06:49-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:06:49):**  like soybeans.  But my point is you cannot call ethanol raised in Southwest Kansas renewable with a clear  conscience knowing that we're pumping water out of the ugala, which is non-renewable.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:04):**  To me, that just sits wrong with me.  And I would have this debate with anyone.  It's a lie.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:09):**  It's just plain and simply a lie.  Because it's like, again, I have nothing against the guys involved in it.  I have nothing growing it.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:15):**  Just don't call it renewable because it's not.  It comes down to a question of emissions and how they categorize emissions.  Just bear with me.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:26):**  So there's L throw a car analogy out.  So there's three kinds of emissions that they're starting to categorize for a business.  And this goes into ESG scores, environmental, social governance scores that they're starting  
**[1:07:42-1:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:42):**  to talk about now.  So you have your scope one emissions, scope two and scope three.  And the car analogy is the scope one emissions are what happens when you turn the key.  
**[1:07:53-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:07:53):**  That's your scope one emissions, what comes out of your tailpipe, the waste oil you used,  the waste tires, the waste brake pads.  Those are like direct effects, scope one.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:08:03):**  So scope two is going to be the energy and emissions of taking those assemblies and putting  them together.  And scope three is going to be all the emissions that are emitted making those assemblies,  
**[1:08:19-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:08:19):**  processing that material and mining it out of the ground.  So a company can look at their scope one emissions and say, oh, we're not that bad because we  don't emit much out of our tailpipe.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:08:32):**  But if you're making iPhones that are full of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lithium,  and all this other crap, those are not clean mining processes.  They're not clean refining processes.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:08:45):**  Yeah, when you're in that room assembling the phone, you're in a completely German dust  free environment.  But all that stuff comes ripped right out of the ground at very low purity and has to  
**[1:08:55-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:08:55):**  be refined and processed and refined and processed before it eventually ends up in the phone.  So what I'm getting is very few people have looked past their scope one emissions.  And now we're getting companies starting to look at their scope two and scope three emissions.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:09:10):**  And I don't think very many companies are going to survive a scope three emissions analysis,  especially the ethanol industry.  Because okay, so they can claim that there's like maybe some positive environmental benefit,  
**[1:09:24-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:09:24):**  like there's a positive carbon balance to burning ethanol in cars.  I don't buy it.  Like I have a really hard time seeing how burning ethanol is actually saving any fossil  
**[1:09:36-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:09:36):**  fuel from being burned.  In order to grow that ethanol and grow the corn for the ethanol, like you said, we got  to pump a lot of water out of the Ogallala aquifer that's really deep.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:09:45):**  Which costs fuel to pump alone.  Which costs fuel to pump.  Oh, well, my irrigation pivots on electric.  
**[1:09:49-1:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:09:49):**  Yeah, well, that still costs fuel.  I mean, even if it comes out of a coal fired power plant, it's still a fossil fuel.  I mean, if you're going to pump all your irrigation water with your own private wind farm, fine,  
**[1:10:03-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:03):**  great, do that.  I don't care.  So we've got to pump a lot of water on it.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:08):**  Well, we've got to build that irrigation system that requires a lot of metal, a lot of pipe,  a lot of plastic, a lot of fittings, and some controls.  You can't just hammer that with one rock on another rock.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:21):**  And then there's also the inputs.  Not to mention the big green tractors.  Not to mention the big implements.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:28):**  Not to mention the combines.  Not to mention the trucks to haul that crop to field.  So we have all of these things that nobody's looked at the Scope 3 emissions on, and we're  
**[1:10:37-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:37):**  just saying, we're just going to dump all this energy in, ignore everything below the  line, and just look at what we're taking off the field and what we're putting in here and  saying, yes, this is green.  
**[1:10:47-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:10:47):**  It's absolute and utter madness to be taking fossil fuel that is millions of years old  to be pumping water that's not much younger than it to put on a crop that we're going  to put on even more synthetics that are derived from fossil fuels, spend more fossil fuels  
**[1:11:04-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:04):**  to harvest it, to transport it to a processing facility, to put more fossil fuels into it.  And then we're going to take that product and blend it with our fossil fuels and say  we're doing something?  
**[1:11:17-1:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:17):**  I don't get it.  I just, I can't get it.  Are there actually, are there actually educated, I'm using quotes, nobody can see this, educated  
**[1:11:28-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:28):**  folks that are genuinely trying to convince people that ethanol is like net positive for  the ecosystem?  Like surely nobody's actually saying this at that point.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:42):**  Absolutely.  There are people still saying that.  Absolutely.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:46):**  Even here where we are.  I'm sure there's university professors that have built a career on telling people how  good ethanol is and they're never backed down from that.  
**[1:11:53-1:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:11:53):**  Okay.  I can buy that people are telling people that, but do you guys think that those professors  that are saying these things actually have the ability to turn the blinders on to realize  
**[1:12:04-1:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:04):**  that all of this is not.  There's a lot of data out there that supports them.  How that data is accumulated and how true it is and how unbiased it is, I have no idea.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:14):**  But there's a lot of data that they use and support.  I mean, so I don't know.  So it depends on where you buy your science from.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:21):**  Exactly.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:24):**  I guess it depends on the scientist you buy.  You bought too.  Exactly.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:27):**  A lot of it, yeah.  Ethanol is just, you know, 10 years ago, even five, six years ago, you probably could have  convinced me that ethanol was okay because I didn't really think about it.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:38):**  Well, it's like, I mean, tell me how it's different from the solar industry.  Tell me how it's different from the wind energy.  I mean, if you really think about all the processes you mentioned, you manufacture something,  
**[1:12:52-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:12:52):**  you can almost throw both those industries in the same deal because it takes a massive  amount of energy to produce a solar panel.  It takes a massive amount of fossil fuels to get a wind farm up and running.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:02):**  Yep.  Well, it takes a massive amount of fossil fuel to keep the wind farm up and running.  All of those are, you know, probably in the same category.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:12):**  So I mean, there's a reason, I don't know who bullshits the science and who don't.  I mean, all I'm saying is you got to ask why.  And the moment you start asking why, there's a whole lot more questions that pop up about  
**[1:13:24-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:24):**  every one of these.  You know, natural gas, a lot of people are flaming it.  But is there really anything more sustainable at this point than utilizing natural gas?  
**[1:13:36-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:36):**  I don't know.  That's a question I've asked a lot of times.  Like when we talk about fossil fuel, and Brian and I have talked several times about like  
**[1:13:44-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:44):**  energy and I just told him the other day I was having a hard time with even like eating  food now because I feel like everything, every single bit of food that we eat that comes  from more than 100 miles away, I'm able to afford because somebody else is being exploited.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:13:59):**  Somebody down the road is being exploited.  And if you're not using a fossil fuel to produce it, somebody's being exploited.  I don't know if you've read all of Joe Sullivan's books, but you know, in one of them, he talks  
**[1:14:11-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:14:11):**  about the, you know, everything that gets transported literally 1800 miles so you can  have a fresh strawberry on your plate in the middle of the winter.  You should not have avocado toast in February in Vancouver, Canada.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:14:24):**  Exactly.  I get that.  But it's realistic.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:14:28):**  And you know, so are we going to go back 50 years in technology just because we have a  sudden moral compass when we don't, I'm not going to have no, but we might have to go  50 years back in history because we don't have a choice because the truckers can't get  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:14:43):**  the damn avocado.  I mean, that's, that's, that's what I'm seeing.  That's a point.  
**[1:14:49-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:14:49):**  You know, the don't get me started on the trucking industry.  But you know, back to the strawberries and avocados, like, I think we got to draw a line  somewhere about, you know, I, I'm not willing to give up avocado just yet for seven months  
**[1:15:02-1:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:02):**  of the year.  It's like, you know, you got to, there's export, there's a lot more to it.  I mean, you know, Mexico's got, got time where they export a crap load.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:11):**  We're on the same continent.  In the summer, you might have it Florida.  You might have it, you know, I think it's a, I think global trade, I mean, you're a  
**[1:15:18-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:18):**  big global trade guy and, and I, and I think global trade has a way and I think some of  what Joel's trying to say makes sense if you want to go back to the roots and, you know,  be low energy producing food.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:30):**  But at the same time, I think we got to be realistic about, you know, if you can export,  if you can sell beef off the ranch to New York, why wouldn't you do it?  Brian might be the wrong guy to ask that question to you on it.  
**[1:15:49-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:49):**  Okay.  So you threw kind of a moral question at me right there.  Like if you could sell beef in New York City, would you having a ranch in the red Hills  
**[1:15:58-1:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:15:58):**  of Kansas?  And no, I would, I would much rather sell all of my product right out the ranch gate  to my neighbors.  
**[1:16:09-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:16:09):**  100% I would much rather take care of my neighbors and my community first.  But if my community, my neighbors were taken care of and somebody in New York wanted to  give me a 50% premium over what I was selling here for, you bet your ass I would put it  
**[1:16:24-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:16:24):**  on a truck and send it to New York City.  That's the part of that.  I disagree with the Joel Salatin deal is like we're all looking at opportunities and getting  
**[1:16:31-1:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:16:31):**  the best return on investment.  And if, you know, Pratt don't buy every beef that comes off your ranch, but you can sell,  you know, at a 20% premium in Kansas City or at a 50% premium in New York City, why  
**[1:16:44-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:16:44):**  would you not do that?  You wouldn't do it if it wasn't reasonable.  And I think it has more to do with instead of like everything that Joel's saying is right  
**[1:16:51-1:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:16:51):**  or wrong, has more to do with being intentional about not only what you're buying, but what  you're selling and why.  And if Brian wants to sell beef in New York City, why wouldn't he?  
**[1:17:01-1:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:01):**  Well, he wouldn't do it if it wasn't reasonable cost wise.  And if the shipping expenses offset the profit, then it, then he wouldn't probably want to  do that.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:11):**  Yeah.  Regardless of who pays the shipping and in the long run, if it's not profitable, you  don't do it.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:16):**  But the only way it becomes profitable typically is because somewhere down the line, someone  has been exploited, right?  Like your first point, you know, our food is very energy inefficient.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:30):**  I don't see that changing.  I just don't see, we almost got to have a total disaster to go back to local.  Like $6 diesel?  
**[1:17:40-1:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:40):**  Even $6 diesel.  I mean, really.  If you go to any town, I mean, I'll start Wichita, you go to Wichita, you go down to  
**[1:17:49-1:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:17:49):**  Oklahoma City, you go Dallas, you go Abilene, and not so much Abilene, Texas, but you go  Lubbock, Texas, Amarillo, Texas, you go up Kearney, Nebraska, any one of these towns that  are growing, there's just freaking hundreds and hundreds of houses popping up around these  
**[1:18:07-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:18:07):**  cities.  And it's like, I don't know where they work, if they're all lawyers or all doctors, but  someone making money somewhere.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:18:16):**  And these people are going to the Whole Foods, these people are going to the Hy-Vees, and  they're buying $17 a pound lamb chops.  And they're buying the $12 T-bone.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:18:28):**  It's people fleeing the coasts and the two built up areas on the East Coast and West  Coast that are...  I don't know if they're coming from the moon, but they're spending money.

They are spending money, but most people that live those lifestyles, not as a whole generalization,  but most people that are living those suburban lifestyles with those houses that they're  
**[1:18:50-1:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:18:50):**  building that are $300 Tiki Taki houses are living on credit.  I don't give a shit what they live on.  If they pay me a premium for my lamb chops, I don't care.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:00):**  If they're paying $17 a pound for lamb chops.  In the short term, yes.  But when you add...  
**[1:19:04-1:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:04):**  I don't think short term.  Those growths not going to stop.  It's going to take a 2008 plus times two event to stop that.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:12):**  And I don't even think this coming recession, if it's ever going to happen, is going to  be that big.  Not for lamb chops.  
**[1:19:19-1:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:19):**  I don't think it's going to affect lamb chops like it's going to affect other things.  I don't think it's going to affect a whole lot of food at all besides the bottom end  food.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:27):**  You were saying the packers.  The packers, the lamb packers, the people that are running on really high volume, really  low margins, I see that's the people that's going to hurt.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:37):**  Yeah.  Eventually it's all going to happen at once is what I see.  Because if you take those margins that are already tight and you throw in 100% increase  
**[1:19:45-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:45):**  in tariffs and transport.  Houston, we have a problem.  They're going to be probably by the time this episode comes out, they'll be feeling a lot  
**[1:19:55-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:19:55):**  of that pain.  I don't disagree.  And I don't see how those low margins can be sustainable long term with the current  
**[1:20:07-1:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:07):**  economic outlook.  I just don't see it.  There's going to be a lot of hurt coming in.  
**[1:20:13-1:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:13):**  I'm not sure.  Some of us are going to make it.  Some of us might not make it, but all I'm saying is it's a very good place to be to  
**[1:20:20-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:20):**  be a price maker in this point in the game instead of a price taker.  It is.  And it's also, I think right now people are really having to come to terms with how much  
**[1:20:29-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:29):**  food costs to raise versus how much they've been paying for it.  And a lot of people in our small communities are seeing this because we're connected to  our farmers.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:38):**  So I have people telling me, I understand why you're charging this much for your eggs  now.  And people in the city that are buying eggs at the grocery store are really confused why  
**[1:20:45-1:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:45):**  eggs are $6 now.  You go to the little grocery store in Greensburg or you go to the Walmart here in town and  really everything sells.  
**[1:20:54-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:20:54):**  I mean the low budget stuff, the high budget stuff, everything really sells.  You go to the Whole Foods in Wichita and you go look in depth, 90% of the shelves that  are the most expensive item is the one that sell out first.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:09):**  People that spend their money intentionally shop more intentionally.  They don't go to the store to get a bargain.  They go to the store to get good food.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:15):**  Exactly.  The people that walk into that Whole Foods, they know what they want.  They're going to go look for it.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:21):**  They're going to find the best version of that and they don't care what they pay for  it.  And that's why Farm to Market is working better for people right now because people are coming  
**[1:21:29-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:29):**  to you looking for the product you're creating and how you created it.  And really they need to feed their family.  And if they can do all of that with the money they have, they're happy.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:39):**  Plus, those people have figured out that a single beef or a single ribeye from Brian's  Ranch is worth in nutrients five times what the one from Walmart is.  I think COVID has done a huge service in connecting people to their food and really waking people  
**[1:21:59-1:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:21:59):**  up to what the value is of food and local food and the difference between Smithfield  bacon compared to my delicious bacon that I get from Curt and Andy or whoever I get  it from.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:12):**  We've actually done some cool measurements and how much food you have left after you  cook and it's insane.  And the amount of food it takes to fill you up.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:19):**  That's the big key right there.  I can drink a cup of milk from the dairy.  Nutrient density is key.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:24):**  And I don't think people are realizing that.  How full you feel.  Not just how full you are and how much you need, but how full you actually feel after  
**[1:22:32-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:32):**  a meal and how satisfied you feel after a meal.  The nutrients of real nutrient dense food.  And that came with a story that doesn't just fill your belly, it fills your heart too,  
**[1:22:43-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:43):**  really.  Some of the best bread I've ever had was a whole gale spread.  Gale spread.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:50):**  Yeah.  Was Turkey Red that he grew and sourdough.  He made I don't know if he grew the wheat or not, but it was it was local wheat that  
**[1:22:58-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:22:58):**  he'd grown and he made homemade bread.  I think the wheat was his and the corn came from McCauley Kincaid.  They make cornbread.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:05):**  Yeah.  With made cornbread with with bloody butcher corn.  We had a really cool meal with some people up in Wichita a few months ago.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:11):**  He makes good whiskey too.  Yes, that's Russell said that.  Russell Hedrick said that.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:16):**  I've exchanged a bottle of brandy for a bottle of his whiskey almost every time we meet.  Is brandy your thing?  Oh, absolutely.  
**[1:23:23-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:23):**  Is that a South African thing?  Yep.  How do you make brandy?  
**[1:23:28-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:28):**  From grapes.  Grapes?  Yep.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:31):**  I didn't know that.  I think if you have a few ochos, it's get made from another alcohol because, you know,  grapes, wine, brandy.  
**[1:23:37-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:37):**  So you make brandy with wine?  It's the next step.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:41):**  I think that you'd like take wine and pull some of the water out to make brandy.  I honestly don't know how they make it.  As long as they keep on making it, I'm good with it.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:50):**  It is delicious.  It's just delicious.  It doesn't care.  
**[1:23:53-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:53):**  You know, as long it can get expensive.  Just as long as it doesn't get scarce.  Well, I'm good with it.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:23:59):**  As long as the lights stay on, the brandy flows.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:24:03):**  So let's talk a little bit about farming for grazing.  While we were touring around the ranch this morning, you talked about some of the history  of some of your fields that they've been continuously cropped wheat for probably 100 years since  
**[1:24:19-1:24:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:24:19):**  it was prairie grass and broke out originally.  So walk me through the last seven or eight years on the farm since you guys really started  getting into sheep and how you're transitioning your farmland and what you're going towards.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:24:37):**  So we're trying to get into a grazing system.  When we started, literally we wanted sheep to take care of the bindweed.  One of the quarters we rented and then owned or bought had a huge bindweed problem.  
**[1:24:55-1:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:24:55):**  That was the main goal.  That was 2016's goal.  In 2018, when we bought that quarter, I was looking at her balance sheet over two years  
**[1:25:10-1:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:10):**  on the 50,000 or 60,000 initial vestment that she did.  And I'm looking at her side of the balance sheet and I'm like, shit, she's making a lot  of money.  
**[1:25:19-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:19):**  I mean, she's like tripled her balance sheet.  And I'm looking at my side and it's like red, black, red, black, red, red, black.  You know, it's like, okay.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:27):**  Everything's not, you know.  Maybe we should look at this another way.  Maybe we shouldn't have the sheep compliment the farm.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:33):**  Maybe we should have the farm compliment the sheep.  Because obviously, you know, the sheep is making way more money and building more equity  than what the farm is.  
**[1:25:41-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:41):**  And so 2018 is when our vision really changed and we tried to find a way to make the farm  be more supportive to the sheep.  And that's when our mindset change came on the cash crops.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:25:56):**  We were a big, we were, first we were trying to see how the sheep could help the cash crops.  And in 2018, we're like screw the cash crops.  We're going to find a way where the cash crops and which cash crops we can grow that is beneficial  
**[1:26:09-1:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:09):**  for the sheep, which is why we stopped growing more corn and stopped growing more milo.  Because you know, milo stalks are really good in the winter for the, I mean, even cows.  Well sheep, if I got, like last year, we had a windstorm come in and I lost some ears.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:24):**  I lost about 30 bushel of ears on the ground.  Okay.  Well that corn circle is useless to me for the sheep.  
**[1:26:30-1:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:30):**  I can't use it.  Too much corn?  Absolutely.  
**[1:26:34-1:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:34):**  If I put the sheep in there, they'll be dead in 24 hours.  And so we just wasted a 60 acre opportunity that I walked out to walk away from, which  is still bugging me today.  
**[1:26:45-1:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:45):**  And so we decided that milo is the best way to go because if the milo goes down, they  can eat it.  And milo, they don't, they don't get, I mean, it's not as bad as corn in excess.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:26:59):**  And the forages are there with it.  We're really like, you know, in a corn field, they just pick up the corn.  They don't eat the corn leaves.  
**[1:27:04-1:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:04):**  They don't eat the corn stalks.  But in a milo field, they'll eat the, they'll chew that whole freaking thing like a sugar  cane and try and get every bit of sugar out of it.  
**[1:27:12-1:27:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:12):**  Right.  So they're getting more fiber, not just sugar.  If you look at a milo stalk that the sheep has been through, it looks like it got ran  
**[1:27:18-1:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:18):**  through a swather.  I mean, it's flat, it's all chewed up.  And so now we're trying to grow milo.  
**[1:27:25-1:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:25):**  Well, this year, last year, we noticed that in between the milo rows, really there's a  waste.  And so we're looking at intercropping, you know, to try and, what can we do with the  
**[1:27:39-1:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:39):**  milo so we have better food after we harvest?  And so this year we're going to do some cowpeas.  So we're going to, we're going to drill the cowpeas with milo and then still harvest the  
**[1:27:51-1:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:27:51):**  milo and then hopefully have more residue and more biomass and a different plan to increase  palatability and digestibility of the milo stalks.  So that's, that's what are we going to try and do this year?  
**[1:28:04-1:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:04):**  Now it might be a total disaster.  I don't know.  I'll tell you, you know, this fall, but we'll find out.  
**[1:28:09-1:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:09):**  That's what we're going to try and do 30 acres of that.  I got 20 acres of dry land and 30 acres of irrigator we can do that with.  And, and time will tell, we'll, we'll have some cowpeas when we'll put it in.  
**[1:28:19-1:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:19):**  I'll probably put a pound of radish or a pound of ripe with it, you know, just for a brassica.  Pound an acre?  A pound an acre.  
**[1:28:26-1:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:26):**  Okay.  And, uh, we'll probably go like five pounds of milo, 10 pounds of cowpeas and a pound  of radish.  
**[1:28:32-1:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:32):**  Okay.  And we're going to put that mix out and we're going to irrigate it just like we would normal  irrigated crop, but we're not going to spray pre-emerge.  
**[1:28:39-1:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:39):**  We're not going to put any fertilizer.  We're going to see what that does.  How does sheep eat the brassicas?  
**[1:28:44-1:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:44):**  Oh, they love it.  Do they pull them out or do they just eat the tops?  No, no, they just eat the tops and it's very high protein.  
**[1:28:50-1:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:28:50):**  Uh, it's like sugar.  I mean they, they love for it.  So, so anyway, so that's been the challenge for the last four years is how to change our

Well, we get to the numbers that we do.  
**[1:29:11-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:29:11):**  So we know we plan Milo, we can, we can still harvest the Milo and raise the Milo.  So we've been trying to, that's been a challenge for us to try and find crops we can harvest,  but still have good residue, soybeans, Sanogo.  
**[1:29:24-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:29:24):**  And so that's been a challenge is trying to find stuff where we can, we can really benefit  and maximize both production and biomass and nutrition for the sheep for the winter because  winter stockpiling has been a huge problem for us.  
**[1:29:41-1:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:29:41):**  That's, that's my number one grazing problem is figuring out is, is cause I had to start  planning my winter grazing three months ago for this, for the coming winter, right?  As soon as winter's over, you got to start planning your next winter's grazing.  
**[1:30:00-1:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:30:00):**  You know, I'm going to need to find some protein.  Not sure where I, where I'm going to get that, but I've got a few ideas.  Um, so the question I would have right now is how much you're, you're talking about that  
**[1:30:14-1:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:30:14):**  field that you're irrigating, how much water can you pump on that a year?  Like in terms of, of inches of moisture or acre feet.  So I have a two gallon per acre and I have pretty much 24 acre feet.  
**[1:30:29-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:30:29):**  So if you'll do the math, you really can't pump that much.  So I, I usually end up anywhere between 11 and 16 acre feet.  Uh, I say that 11 to 16 inches.  
**[1:30:44-1:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:30:44):**  So my, so two acre feet is about 24 inches that you can put out.  Yeah.  So I don't think I've done more than 17 and seven years.  
**[1:30:52-1:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:30:52):**  So even though we pump, seems like all the time, it's only, you know, 200, 250 gallon  a minute.  But it's eight and it would be 18 inches of rain on that field.  
**[1:31:04-1:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:04):**  equivalent of 18 inches of rain.  Okay.  Which, which for the listeners is actually probably about what you'd get, maybe a little  
**[1:31:11-1:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:11):**  more than you should get according to the national weather service.  We're about 16 inches average actually.  And so it would be, you know, a couple inches more than what we would get in rainfall if  
**[1:31:22-1:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:22):**  we get the rainfall.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:31:25-1:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:25):**  At the right time.  Right.  And so, you know, we cannot, uh, I would say we can, we can probably stock about 10 head  
**[1:31:33-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:33):**  per acre under 200, 200 gallon a minute.  And, and, and if you're getting 10 inches from the sky and another 15 from your pivot,  that's 25 inches of rain.  
**[1:31:44-1:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:44):**  Yes.  10 acres a cow.  That's pretty strong stocking.  
**[1:31:47-1:31:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:47):**  I mean, that's a good stocking.  Yeah.  10 sheep per acre.  
**[1:31:50-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:50):**  Oh, 10 sheep an acre.  Yes.  So that's, so we can, we can stock, we got 125 acres and we grace 30 at a time.  
**[1:31:58-1:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:31:58):**  And so we'll run anywhere for 300 to 500 head per 30 acres.  And so we rotate that.  We usually have two thirties in production all the time.  
**[1:32:08-1:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:08):**  That's the goal.  So we'll grace two weeks, anywhere from a week to three weeks, and then we'll change  to the other side.  
**[1:32:15-1:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:15):**  Week to three weeks, change to the other side.  So we rotate anything between a week and three weeks, depending on weather, depending on  heat, depending on rainfall, and we'll back and swath.  
**[1:32:24-1:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:24):**  And we'll rotate around the circle as winter and summer goes wrong, because when we used  to our planet, we got the next one in production.  And as soon as we pull off one, we got that one planted back and we'll next two is in  
**[1:32:35-1:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:35):**  production.  So always try and have two thirties in production that we can rotate between.  You asked earlier about, about strip grazing essentially, and asked Brian whether he thought  
**[1:32:46-1:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:46):**  it was worth it and the difference between that with cows and sheep.  And you mentioned how your sheep seem to kind of essentially mob graze is kind of what it  sounded like to me that you were saying, and that you can leave them there for a couple  
**[1:32:57-1:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:32:57):**  of weeks and they really won't go back to where they were.  They they usually by the time they go back, if you're any doing a half-assed job in management  is when you remove them.  
**[1:33:08-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:08):**  And so we'll we'll we'll pay attention to that and they'll go into a field and they'll  take everything from a foot to about four inches.  And that's the whole deal of grazing 50 percent.  
**[1:33:21-1:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:21):**  Good luck with sheep.  I mean, I'm just telling you straight up.  They're either zero or 80.  
**[1:33:26-1:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:26):**  It's all or nothing.  And so they don't know what it is to just have more about rest.  I imagine with them.  
**[1:33:32-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:32):**  Yes.  A cow doesn't know where to stop at half that leaf either.  The problem with sheep is if you got a mob graze them, you're going to leave half the  
**[1:33:43-1:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:43):**  acres with 100 percent and half the acres with nothing.  So you've got to make a decision about what you want to do and how much you want to do.  And I'm looking at how scarce food forages is.  
**[1:33:57-1:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:33:57):**  We've made the decision to graze it down, give it enough rest to come back.  And so and so we when we utilize it, we utilize it like if we if there's a foot of forage,  we take a foot of forage, then we move on.  
**[1:34:09-1:34:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:09):**  It makes sense that your sheep wouldn't be as tolerant of the pushing that we can do  with the Korean A's as far as like them knowing selection and knowing what to eat out of a  pasture because it's a smaller bodied animal.  
**[1:34:20-1:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:20):**  So less choice for less amount of time would affect them a lot more severely.  So I could see why you would need to give them a bigger space and not push them so hard.  It's funny when you change pasture.  
**[1:34:30-1:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:30):**  So about a month ago, we changed from our grass pasture to the oats and the grass pasture  is mostly.  So if you've talked to a wheat farmer, there's a grass that can't kill in the wheat fallow  
**[1:34:44-1:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:44):**  and it's like a showy chloris.  It's called a feather top rose grass.  And everyone's got it.  
**[1:34:50-1:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:50):**  It's a leg don't kill it, round up don't kill it.  Paraquat just pisses it off.  It just doesn't die.  
**[1:34:55-1:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:34:55):**  So a lot of guys went back to a sweet plow to try and kill the grass.  Well that's what we have majority of that started off in this grass quarter that we  have.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:05):**  We now have like four different perennials that came back, but that was the original  that came in.  And mother nature gave it and we're like, screw it, we'll just graze it.  
**[1:35:13-1:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:13):**  And it's really nutritious.  They love it.  So we went from that grass quarter to the oats.  
**[1:35:18-1:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:18):**  When we moved them over for the first two days, they didn't touch the oats.  They grazed the four foot edge around the oats field that was the same grass as they  had where they were.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:28):**  They knew what they needed.  They knew they couldn't change over to the oats because they were going to have the shittings.  And so they would eat some oats, but for fiber they would come back to the grass and they  
**[1:35:41-1:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:41):**  cleaned up that two acre or that two four foot strip around the field before they started  going into the oats.  So it's really funny how the sheep will manage what they eat and how they pick.  
**[1:35:52-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:35:52):**  It's like when there's pigweeds and kochia and tall stuff, when it's hot, they'll go  out in the morning and they'll eat the kochia, they'll eat the pigweeds.  As soon as it gets hot and stuff starts wilting up, they'll come back.  
**[1:36:03-1:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:03):**  They'll go back and they eat the short grass in the middle of the day when it's hot.  When it's not so hot.  Yep.  
**[1:36:08-1:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:08):**  And then come back tonight, they'll go eat the kochia and the pigweeds again.  So they know what they can and cannot eat during the day if they have a choice.  Do you feel like the pigweeds have something they shouldn't have when it's hot?  
**[1:36:19-1:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:19):**  When it's wilted, this high protein is it out, it'll kill them.  Or what they eat in the middle of the day is reacting to the photoperiod, the sunlight,  and producing more sugars during the middle of the day when the plants they're eating  
**[1:36:36-1:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:36):**  in the morning and the evening are producing sugars in morning and evening or they're  not producing a toxin that they are producing in the middle of the day close to peak photosynthesis.  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.  
**[1:36:47-1:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:47):**  It makes a whole lot of sense to look at that.  They are really good selective grazers when it comes to what they can and cannot eat.  They have a lot less goofing with them than cows.  
**[1:36:56-1:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:36:56):**  Just like you said with the koreanis, they probably have a lot more condition to understand  what they need to eat rather than being force fed corn all day every day.  Like you were talking about with the dorpers, they do great on grass.  
**[1:37:09-1:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:09):**  They finish on grass.  That's where we need to be with our cattle.  We need to be where they're going to go ahead and put on that itch of back fat on grass.  
**[1:37:17-1:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:17):**  And it's genetics.  And then we can go take them and feed them a little bit of corn to blow them up to get  that marbling in the ribeye that everybody wants.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:25):**  It's genetics, it's not moron.  Yes.  That was my favorite thing you said all day.  
**[1:37:31-1:37:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:31):**  But moron.  What did you call it?  The moron approach?  
**[1:37:34-1:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:34):**  The moron approach.  Yeah.  And sometimes that's probably written without an E in it.  
**[1:37:41-1:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:41):**  Yes.  We started joking with it.  Michael and Bryce and I, we deal...  
**[1:37:47-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:47):**  Bryce is in Hayes and Michael's up in Norton.  That's Bryce Custer we're talking about, right?  And so the two of them and I have always joked about things.  
**[1:37:55-1:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:37:55):**  We text each other with goofy shit all the time.  Because if I ask a neighbor what some of the things we think of doing, they're like, I'm  batshit crazy.  
**[1:38:03-1:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:03):**  But between Michael and Bryce, it's like, I'd ask a stupid, crazy question.  And one of them's like, oh, I've done that.  We share a lot of mutual things.  
**[1:38:13-1:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:13):**  I've done that.  Let me tell you how I screwed it up.  We've come up with this whole deal about, they always tell you to put moron, this, this,  
**[1:38:21-1:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:21):**  or that.  And you know, more anon or more pion or more kaon or whatever.  And so, you know, we've made up the whole deal about the moron approach because, you  
**[1:38:30-1:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:30):**  know, everything asked you, you know, they just want you to put moron.  And it kind of became a joke after that.  But it's true.  
**[1:38:37-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:37):**  You've started a hashtag right now.  Yes.  It's really...  
**[1:38:41-1:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:41):**  Ranching reboot hashtag moron.  How are we going to spell that?  M-O-R-E-O-N?  
**[1:38:45-1:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:45):**  Dash.  M-O-R-E.  Yeah.  
**[1:38:48-1:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:48):**  M-O-R-E dash O-N.  Or M-O-R dash O-N.  M-O-R dash O-N.  
**[1:38:51-1:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:51):**  Yes.  Something like that.  But yeah, it's really, I joke about all the time, but it's the answer to everything.  
**[1:38:59-1:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:38:59):**  Just put moron.  Well, it's just, everything is like that.  Medicine...  
**[1:39:03-1:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:03):**  And that's, you know, we get a lot of, we sell a lot of inputs that is there to reduce  inputs and a lot of guys don't get it.  And I'm like, you know, if you're going to spend this much money, go ahead.  
**[1:39:14-1:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:14):**  But you know, if you want to try and spend less money, you know, try some of this, try  some of this, whether it's biological or, you know.  You can spend the same money this year with the chance of spending less next year.  
**[1:39:25-1:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:25):**  Exactly.  And it's about reducing inputs.  I mean, like right now, we've got half of 2.5 or 4.8.  
**[1:39:34-1:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:34):**  So 2.4.  We got 2.4 pounds of FOS in our corn crop.  And it's not like it's this year.  
**[1:39:40-1:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:40):**  This is a new field, so this would be just this year.  But on the field, we're just, we're converting to Bermuda right now.  We've put that on for the last seven years.  
**[1:39:49-1:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:49):**  And I do tissue samples and I don't have deficiency in FOS.  And everyone's like, well, that can't be you're mining.  And I'm like, well, my soil test hasn't changed a bit in seven years.  
**[1:39:58-1:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:39:58):**  Well, you're doing the wrong soil test.  It's coming from somewhere, you know.  And so we touched a little bit about the, you know, parent material, you know, mining  
**[1:40:07-1:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:40:07):**  parent material and converting parent material.  I think, I think we just touched a little bit on it, but I don't think people are even  close to understanding the biology of what we can use and abuse.  
**[1:40:17-1:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:40:17):**  I would agree with that.  And that, that was a really good discussion and we're not going to repeat it here because  it'd be double over length, but that was a really great discussion about roots and uptake  
**[1:40:29-1:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:40:29):**  and removal rate of nutrients from a specific plant.  Like we were talking about a specific tree and how many nutrients are actually being  removed by wildlife from that, from that root zone or from that grow zone, or even from  
**[1:40:45-1:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:40:45):**  like a zone kind of around that tree where it would be getting, you know, bacterial and  mycorrhizal fungal nutrient exchange with other plants.  Like, and we came up, so we were talking about a walnut tree and we figured that at least  
**[1:40:59-1:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:40:59):**  90% of the fruit of that walnut tree gets transported away from anywhere where that  tree is going to uptake nutrients.  And I think you're right.  
**[1:41:09-1:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:41:09):**  There is, you know, we underestimate the ability of deep rooted plants to synthesize what they  need from deep, deep layers in the soil.  When it's healthy, especially.  
**[1:41:23-1:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:41:23):**  I don't think, I don't think removal rates has been updated to incorporate biology at  all.  To incorporate additional, like added it.  
**[1:41:33-1:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:41:33):**  I think, and you know, like I said, you know, I've, I've, I've put several people on the  spot and in a good way, but I feel like a lot of soils, there's not much soil science  that's even been like the new stuff is updated, but there's still a lot of, lot of science  
**[1:41:51-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:41:51):**  about soil.  I don't think removal rates has been updated in 60 years.  I guess that's what I was getting at.  
**[1:41:57-1:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:41:57):**  Like there's, there's things that we think about, like, you know, how much nutrients  does it take to have this crop or what is the nutrient density of this food?  Like those haven't been looked at in a long time.  
**[1:42:07-1:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:42:07):**  No guys, guys like, you know, uh, Lance and Ray are, like I said, I mentioned, you know,  those two guys that I lean on for, for discussions like that.  And I don't think even they have, have, have gotten to the, the answer or the, a good answer  
**[1:42:21-1:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:42:21):**  in how much biology have changed removal rates and the possibility of, of, of free mobile  rates and, and how you can decrease removal rates by having a functioning of soil that  with the relationships below ground.  
**[1:42:34-1:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:42:34):**  I, I, I think we're just scratching the surface and I think we can get by and grow a big crop  with very little input.  Absolutely.  
**[1:42:43-1:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:42:43):**  I think, I think so.  I think that, I think that that focusing on inputs and the things that have been taken  away in the past and not looking at the system as a whole and all of the things that are  
**[1:42:55-1:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:42:55):**  actually adding to the system, that's not just animal, that's not just what you're putting  on it.  It's the whole function of the way it works and the way all the fungus works.  
**[1:43:04-1:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:04):**  That like...  Tanya mentioned the grass.  I wasn't going to get there, but I'll spend 20 seconds on it.  
**[1:43:10-1:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:10):**  Your pastures.  Yeah.  You have removal rates.  
**[1:43:13-1:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:13):**  Yeah.  You put a, you put a, you put a cow on there.  She gets a calf.  
**[1:43:17-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:17):**  You raise that calf to 700 pounds.  You remove that calf from the ranch.  That's 700 pounds is a removal rate on that grass as a system from your farm.  
**[1:43:26-1:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:26):**  Yes.  Yes.  Yet you don't fertilize or run an airplane and fertilize your farm pastures.  
**[1:43:30-1:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:30):**  Well, no, that would be ridiculous.  Because the cows poop.  Because the cows poop on it.  
**[1:43:34-1:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:34):**  The cows poop it back on.  But you still removed 700 pounds.  In a, in a, in a pure scientific way, you would weigh the cow or the calf that you sold  
**[1:43:42-1:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:42):**  and that's your removal.  If you just use science, you take your calf that you removed, that's 700 pounds and that's  your removal rate.  
**[1:43:50-1:43:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:50):**  And science would demand to know how nature is balancing her books and where that 700  pounds to build the cow came from.  Exactly.  
**[1:43:57-1:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:43:57):**  That's my point.  The reason being, the reason being is the strict black and whiteness of science where  we look at our backyard.  
**[1:44:05-1:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:05):**  That's ridiculous.  It is ridiculous.  When you look at our backyard as a whole.  
**[1:44:08-1:44:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:08):**  But yet we do it every day and we accept it.  Well, who does it every day?  That's you, you look at removal rates.  
**[1:44:15-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:15):**  I mean it's nationally accepted as removal rates.  No one challenges it.  I guess it's just not, I guess it's not something we think about a lot because when you're working  
**[1:44:27-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:27):**  with grass and when you're not working with farming.  We were in Haleoke and I asked Ray this question and Ray's like, who on earth would even think  about something like this?  
**[1:44:36-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:36):**  And I'm like, somebody who's dealing with the whole system because when you see, you  build a system, you can take things out and put things in and the effect is not immediate  or the way you think it is because you're affecting the whole system.  
**[1:44:47-1:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:47):**  I guess that's my point is like, you don't, your pastures don't need extra fertilizer  because you took a 700 pound or 400 pound calf off.  Oh, but corn is different.  
**[1:44:55-1:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:55):**  Exactly.  So it's different.  Oats are different.  
**[1:44:58-1:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:44:58):**  Soybeans are different.  I learned they're totally different for me.  The legumes or any of the warm season or cool cities of grasses that grow in my pasture.  
**[1:45:04-1:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:04):**  Yeah, that won't work here.  We've tried it.  It doesn't work.  
**[1:45:08-1:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:08):**  You're crazy.  Go back to where you came from.  I'm sorry.  
**[1:45:12-1:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:12):**  I have been told to go back where I come from.  What's generally your response?  I would rather say not.  
**[1:45:22-1:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:22):**  I was asked to leave.  I was in a farm visit in Arkansas and I got asked to leave and not come back because I  challenged a guy from the local extension and he didn't like my answer.  
**[1:45:34-1:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:34):**  And so I didn't like your answer or your question.  He didn't like the answer.  I mean, I made an observation with soil and he told me, I have no idea what it's, what  
**[1:45:44-1:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:44):**  I do, what I'm knowing or you know, no idea what I'm talking about.  And I said, well, if I weren't, I wouldn't be here, would I?  And so they didn't like that answer either.  
**[1:45:53-1:46:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:45:53):**  And I got asked not to come back and I haven't been back to be honest, but I'm not sure I'm  not the one missing out.  But anyway, that's a whole discussion for another time.  
**[1:46:04-1:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:46:04):**  People in general and like, I'm going to put myself in this box too because I'm a people  and we have a tendency to get, we feel threatened when somebody challenges what we think we  know.  
**[1:46:18-1:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:46:18):**  And if they're challenging something that's like, we've built layers and layers and layers  of knowledge on over the years.  If they challenge something that's all the way down at the bottom of that, like they're  
**[1:46:29-1:46:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:46:29):**  challenging the base of what makes you, you like they're challenging like a lot of your,  a lot of your core thoughts like, and maybe I'm completely off base, but I kind of like,  I get the sense that this happens in academia.  
**[1:46:44-1:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:46:44):**  Okay.  So not to pick on anybody in particular at all or any land grant university just because  we're in Kansas, let's say Kansas state.  
**[1:46:53-1:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:46:53):**  So you have a professor at Kansas state that shows up bright eyed, bushy tailed in his  thirties starts to do work in a field gets tenure.  They then the tenure board says, we need to see some work.  
**[1:47:07-1:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:07):**  So he writes a nice paper that's full of incorrect conclusions.  Okay.  So he writes this paper and it gets tenure and then he starts teaching classes based  
**[1:47:16-1:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:16):**  on this paper.  And five years down the road, he goes and does more research with some students.  And it's like the new research doesn't support the findings in the paper, but we can't go  
**[1:47:26-1:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:26):**  back against the paper that we already wrote that we're building our career on.  So we're just going to maybe tweak some of the data to make it kind of agree.  And we're going to keep going in five years down the line, we're going to do that again.  
**[1:47:37-1:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:37):**  And we're going to have data that doesn't agree, but that data challenges us.  We got to change the data to where it fits our paradigm.  So it's like we continue to do these things because we don't want to be uncomfortable.  
**[1:47:49-1:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:49):**  We don't want to be challenged.  We don't want other people to challenge us or to challenge the things that we've done  in the past or the things that we know that are true.  
**[1:47:57-1:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:47:57):**  And like we were talking, your word that you used egocentric, that's a function of an ego  structure.  Like I have done this, I have accomplished this, I have done this on this land and don't  
**[1:48:08-1:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:48:08):**  you dare tell me I didn't do it right.  No, that's not what we're saying.  We're saying, yeah, what you did was great when you did it because that was the knowledge  
**[1:48:17-1:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:48:17):**  at the time.  Now we know new things.  We've learned other things.  
**[1:48:22-1:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:48:22):**  Come on this bus with us and let's talk about some of these things that we absolutely know  are true.  Maybe they might not be.  
**[1:48:30-1:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:48:30):**  Like what was that quote, the most dangerous thing is not what could happen but what you  know with absolute certainty can't.  Because if you know with absolute certainty that something can't happen, that's the one  
**[1:48:46-1:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:48:46):**  thing that will happen and will take you out of business.  So that's probably not a bad place to end.  Where can we find you on the internet and how can people get a hold of you, Nick, if  
**[1:49:01-1:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:01):**  they want to argue with you?  I'm on Twitter always.  Always arguing on Twitter.  
**[1:49:06-1:49:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:06):**  Always arguing on Twitter, no filter.  That's what Twitter's for.  Yes.  
**[1:49:11-1:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:11):**  So if they want the nonpolitical sarcastic version, Kansas Farmer on Twitter.  Okay.  Anywhere else?  
**[1:49:17-1:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:17):**  No, we don't have a website for the farm.  We do have a Facebook page for the sheep, Vos Dorpers.  And those are probably the best two places that if they want to talk sheep or anything  
**[1:49:31-1:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:31):**  else unfiltered.  Brian started down this path earlier but I'm going to finish on it before he even said  it.  
**[1:49:37-1:49:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:37):**  I want a farm tour and I want to come talk to your wife about her sheep.  So whether she likes to give tours or not, we might invite ourselves.  She don't mind at all.  
**[1:49:44-1:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:44):**  You guys are welcome anytime.  Ashley's over there so we'll have an excuse.  Yeah, maybe we can get my sister hooked up with you and her husband hooked up with you  
**[1:49:54-1:50:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:49:54):**  and they can have a better situation in their lives.  Maybe they could get sheep on their place.  Sheep's happy place, right?  
**[1:50:00-1:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/72-Nicholaas-Vos-The-Farm-Complements-the-Sheep-e1l00nf#t=1:50:00):**  My wife send me a deal.  One Valentine's like, other girls want flowers for Valentine.  All I want is more sheep.

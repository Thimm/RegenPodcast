This episode is sponsored by C90 Ocean Minerals, nature's most complete trace  mineral salt and the one I feed to my herd. Support for this episode also provided by our generous  patrons on patreon.com forward slash red hills rancher. I'm a little short on editing time today  
**[0:00:14-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:00:14):**  so everything's going before the ad read. For this week's episode we go to my friend Jay Young  up in northwest Kansas who's got about an 8,000 acre mixed farm. We talk about how to define  regenerative agriculture, running cattle on cover crops, how important it is to hire good help,  
**[0:00:29-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:00:29):**  and Johnson-Sue bioreactors and bacterial fungal ratios in soil.  Jay talks about his eternal quest to eliminate phos.  Best of all, Anchor is totally free. Download the Anchor app or go to anchor.fm to get started today.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:01:22):**  You haven't gotten any prettier since the last time I saw you.  No, that's probably going to be the story of everything. But when I get these kind of things,  I noticed that the beer gets crooked. So, there now it's all even.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:01:35):**  I just try not to look at mine because I know my mustache is all jacked up. My beer is kind of  uneven and I just don't even pay attention to it. So, how are things, Jay Young?  Things are going really great. There's a lot of stuff going on. Yesterday's YouTube video was our  
**[0:01:58-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:01:58):**  first sponsored video. And so, I worked with Lance Gungerson and Regen Ag Lab sponsored that. So,  I was really excited about that. And we're getting done drilling wheat. Should be cutting  corn here in a few weeks and got the calves weaned, got the cows preg checked. And  
**[0:02:22-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:02:22):**  yeah, life's good right now. Good deal. All right. So, you're Jay Young.  Tell us a little bit about where you're at and what you do.  So, we're in western Kansas. We farm right at 8,000 acres. A little more than half that is  
**[0:02:43-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:02:43):**  ground we own and the other half is rented farm ground. And so, we have about, was right at 1,000  acres, but we just lost two quarters of irrigated ground that got sold. So, we got, that leaves us  down to seven irrigated circles that we have. And we only have enough water to run five of those.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:03:08):**  So, that's how much irrigated ground that we have. The rest is dry land and we run 150 cows. And so,  on our farming operation, we do a rotation typically of wheat, corn, fallow. That's what  it's been historically, but as we've gotten into regenerative agriculture, we've done more of  
**[0:03:29-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:03:29):**  a cover crop, like a summer cover crop mix followed by a fall cash crop. That seems to be  the system that works the best as far as regenerative agriculture goes. Had a lot of  challenges finding the cover crop system that'll work in between our fallow periods. And right now,  
**[0:03:50-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:03:50):**  the, I don't know, just the more I've looked at it and thought about it, I think the best way to  get regenerative agriculture growing, at least in our environment, is to do a cash crop, if you  can't graze it, is to do a cash crop and interseed cover crops in that cash crop, and then do that  
**[0:04:09-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:04:09):**  continually. Because then you get the diversity that you need. And then you can get the cattle  rotated in over the winter if you can. And if not, then, you know, some of these neighbors close and  they can graze it great. But if not, I really think that's the best way to do it. You know,  
**[0:04:26-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:04:26):**  wheat out here in our area, it's really hard to set the wheat up.  What do you mean set it up?  So like, going wheat right behind corn, like harvest the corn and planting wheat,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:04:38):**  just will work one out of 15 years.  Is that a nutrient or moisture thing?  Moisture. So like the corn, like, if we get a good decent rain in the fall, you know, it's got to be  
**[0:04:52-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:04:52):**  the perfect condition where you're harvesting the corn crop and then you get, you know, moisture  event or you get a moisture event, then you harvest the crop and then you plant it and it's  just rare. We're at 16 inches of annual precipitation in the last three years we've been under that.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:05:09):**  And so, you know, those are those are kind of the challenges that, you know, come when it comes to  regenerative agriculture. So one thing that I did this year to try to keep wheat in the system was  we planted a summer cover crop mix, and we rolled it with a crop roller. And that didn't kill all of  
**[0:05:28-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:05:28):**  it. So we rolled it with a crop roller.  Okay, hold up, hold up, like, I feel like you're just taking the whole audience and throwing them  in the deep end of the pool. Sure. Okay. So you've said regenerative agriculture literally five times  
**[0:05:42-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:05:42):**  in the last, I don't know, four minutes. What is regenerative agriculture? In my opinion, because I  think it's something that's it's hard to nail down a definitive, you know, definition since there's  so many people have different views and different definitions of it. But to me, regenerative  
**[0:05:59-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:05:59):**  agriculture is attempting your best to apply the now six soil health principles that there are. So  the six soil health principles would be living root in the ground as long as possible. For us,  that's a lot less time than it is for other people. Multi species cover crops are diversity  
**[0:06:23-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:06:23):**  of species. So meaning you want to get diversity as much diversity as possible. Or, you know, if  you're somebody like Roy Foltzgras, that looks like diversity of rotations, he has 2000 acres,  and he has, I think, 17 different cash crops. I think this year, it's 12. But he's had a years  
**[0:06:42-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:06:42):**  where he's had 17 different cash crops. Don't talk about Roy too much. I'm going to try to get  him on the podcast. Well, that will get that'll that'll what was for the future. Roy is pretty  amazing. And that'll be it. That'll be a great interview. But anyway, so yeah, so living species  
**[0:07:03-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:07:03):**  are living in the ground as long as possible diversity of species, integrate livestock. So  if you're in our operation, you rotate cattle in with with cover crops. Let's see here minimal  disturbance, which means you're going to do as much no till as possible. Know your context is  
**[0:07:23-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:07:23):**  the newest one. And right now on the spot, I can't think of the one that I'm currently missing.  But anyway, following those those soil health principles is, is to me what regenerative  agriculture is all about and trying to do, you know, I think too many farmers is focuses on  
**[0:07:45-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:07:45):**  how much money they're making. And when you have that short sighted mentality that you're going to  paycheck to paycheck, or your focus is on how much money you're making to survive, you're not  looking big picture. You know, you recommended me the book, dirt, or no, Gil recommend that book, I  
**[0:08:04-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:08:04):**  started reading collapse. And I was talking to Gil, I was like, man, this is this is harder to  get through the night anticipated. He's like, well, read, read dirt first, and then you're  listening to dirt and just going through the history of all of the civilizations that collapsed,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:08:20):**  because of poor farming practices, every single one of them. Yeah, overwhelming and alarming.  And so to see that and then the look around and see that we're not much different, we haven't  learned from history. And the famous saying that those who don't learn from history or felt are  
**[0:08:39-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:08:39):**  doomed to repeat it frightens me. You are here. Yeah, that's where we are. That's where we're at  and now and so, you know, to me, that's why regenerative agriculture is important. And that's  why you want to get in the those soil health principles. So I guess throw that back at you,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:08:55):**  that like is your views of soil health differ? Any from that? No, I think you're, I think you're  spot on. And here's what I'd like to add to that. I think a lot. I think we're still kind of maybe  searching or trying to nail down a universal definition of regenerative agriculture. And  
**[0:09:18-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:09:18):**  I think we're getting close. But I think the part that we're missing is that it's not a destination.  It's not an end state. Right? It's the journey. Like it's, we're always going to be trying to  educate ourselves how to better live in tune with the land and apply the sixth principles of soil  
**[0:09:39-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:09:39):**  health and regenerate the land, you know, back to a productive state where it's supporting  rich biodiversity. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then, you know, when you're just scratching the surface  of what the possibilities are, you know, it, we, the journey to me hasn't lasted been all that  
**[0:09:58-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:09:58):**  long, hasn't really picked up steam as much as it possibly could. And like for us, all the things  that we've been able to change in, you know, the last six years, to me, kind of blows me away about  how, how quickly that those things can happen. But agricultural undertakings, let's say whether  
**[0:10:20-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:10:20):**  we're talking about, you know, growing a crop in a field or growing cows or growing pigs,  it's not a quick process. I mean, it takes time to see a result. And, you know, we can talk a little  bit about carbon. Like, you know, they're still trying to figure out how to measure carbon. And,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:10:39):**  you know, there's an ebb and flow throughout the year of carbon in and out of the soil. So,  if we're taking, you know, a carbon measurement in March and comparing that to a carbon measurement  in September, you know, they're going to be really different. But does that mean we were stored or  
**[0:10:53-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:10:53):**  lost carbon? No, we need to make sure that we're, you know, getting an accurate sample and either  understanding what that yearly cycle is, or we're consistently sampling, you know, the same time  every year. Yeah. Well, I guess it's going to take, I think it's just going to take a,  
**[0:11:13-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:11:13):**  it's going to take a long time to build up the data. Like, I feel like the early adopters and  the regenerative agriculture movement, like, we're operating a lot on faith. That we have faith that  this works. Okay. You know, maybe we're seeing it with our own eyes. Maybe we're, maybe it's  
**[0:11:31-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:11:31):**  confirmation bias. Maybe we're in a stupid echo chamber and we're all, you know, not as smart as  we think we are. But I forgot what I was going to say after that. I'm not as smart as I think I am,  because I forget what I was going to say. Well, and I guess if I back up to what, to our history,  
**[0:11:52-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:11:52):**  you know, our, our conventional, I mean, our, our practices, dad started getting into no till in the  early two thousands. And in 2016, I found out about cover crops. And so it was kind of a passing  because my dad was starting to stop doing no till because the input costs on fertilizers were so  
**[0:12:18-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:12:18):**  high. And so I find out about doing cover crops and I'm all in because I had, the video I watched  was Gabe Brown gazing cattle on cover crops. And so that's the first introduction I had to  anything with cover crops. And 15 minutes into that video, I was in because my thought was  
**[0:12:38-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:12:38):**  that guy is raising cattle on cover crops. I could raise cattle on cover crops. And, you know,  in our, really county has the least amount of cows in, of any county in the state of Kansas.  And that's the county I'm in because it's very, very flat. There's very few creeks and very few  
**[0:12:57-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:12:57):**  areas where people just kept grass in. So there's not a lot of grass to buy, hardly any grass to  rent. And so it wasn't something that was ever an option, but I always enjoyed the winner because  we got to run stalkers. And I loved running stalkers on wheat. I love buying stalkers. I  
**[0:13:14-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:13:14):**  loved selling stalkers. And so when I found out that you could run a cow calf operation on a  cover crop, I was all in. And so I started, I did a whole month's worth of research, reading and  watching as many YouTube videos as possible. And I go to my dad and I said, hey, on the ground,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:13:31):**  on the ground I rent from granddad, which was, gosh, I think it was eight quarters of ground.  I said, I'm going to grow cover crops and I'm going to raise a cow calf operation on cover crops.  And he said, you think you're nuts? Oh yeah. A hundred. And I mean, like looking back on it,  
**[0:13:50-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:13:50):**  I'm the type of, I'm so I'm such a passionate person. And he's a very logical thinker. And  so he needs all the evidence, you know, to, before he jumps in and try something, I just need  somebody telling me you can do this. And I'm like, all right, well, I'll just figure it out along the  
**[0:14:07-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:14:07):**  way. And so, you know, that I started off by buying replacement heifers and we ran those  replacement heifers and I had 15 pair of cows. And so that was the first years, the 15 pair that  I bought and then those replacement heifers. And we, what year was that?  
**[0:14:28-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:14:28):**  2016, we bought the replacement heifers when I bought the 15 pairs. And that year in 2016,  we got the average really good on those females. Some of them we bought for 600 and something.  Some of them we bought for 700 and something. And then the market really went up the following year.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:14:49):**  We sold bred heifers. And so we sold them for $1,800 for the bred heifers. And so at that point,  dad was like, as much work as I put into this, like I want half and which was totally fine. So  he basically bought more cows. And he, we figured out what the value was at the time that he bought  
**[0:15:10-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:15:10):**  more cows. And so we just merged once he bought those cows, we merged it together and form Young  Red Angus LLC. So that was kind of the beginning.  Let's come back to that. Let's talk about Jay. So obviously you're from there. You grew up there.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:15:24):**  Yeah.  As you go off to college.  Yeah. So I went to Garden City Community College. I went on a football scholarship.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:15:35):**  I got red shirted the first year.  What'd you play?  I played cornerback at the beginning, then they moved me to strong safety. But that kind of is an  
**[0:15:47-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:15:47):**  interesting story in and of itself because I got there and I just realized I was way, way not  athletic enough to play at that level. And so I worked my butt off. Like they would let the red  shirts during practice. They didn't have to condition so they could leave. So every red shirt  
**[0:16:06-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:16:06):**  left during conditioning, except for me. And I set the cones up and I worked on my footwork to be  able to cover wide receivers every single day while they were conditioning. And so the spring  rolls around and we're in a meeting and I'm in with the defensive backs and we're going through  
**[0:16:27-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:16:27):**  watching the video of covering wide receivers on the short route portion of the practice.  And the coach was just getting madder and madder and I couldn't really tell why I was getting mad.  Finally, he threw the remote against the wall and broke it. And he turns and he goes,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:16:40):**  Jay, I'm sorry. And then he just starts screaming at everybody else in the room. He says, why  the blank does the worst athlete on our team cover a short route better than the rest of you?  And he was, he was furious that they couldn't cover a short route. And so anyway, at the end  
**[0:16:58-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:16:58):**  of the year meetings, I sat down with him and he gave me a five and effort and it was ones and  twos and everything else. And so he said, there's a great chance that you won't make the team,  even though you put out better effort than anybody else on our team. And so I left that meeting  
**[0:17:16-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:17:16):**  just ready to work harder and prove everybody wrong. But then I realized I wanted to go to  this internship in Texas. So I decided to take their offer to coach the red shirts and weightlifting.  So the following year I coached red shirts and weightlifting, and then went to an internship  
**[0:17:30-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:17:30):**  in Texas where I met my wife. The internship was like a Christian internship that focused on  leadership. And so you spent a year there going through classes on worldview, biblical foundations  and things like that. And then you worked for the ministry during the rest of the time that you were  
**[0:17:51-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:17:51):**  there. And so I would love that. Like, I felt like I grew in my faith a lot, my knowledge of the  Bible, and I met my wife. So I mean, double bonus, double bonus. So I had a great year there went  back for a second year and then came back, moved back to the farm in 2007. My wife and I lived in  
**[0:18:10-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:18:10):**  Alexandria, Egypt for about six months doing missions work in 2000.  What was that like?  It was awesome. So Alexandria, Egypt has a population of Denver, Colorado.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:18:25):**  Okay. So that's close enough to Cairo, close enough to the pyramids, yeah?  Yeah. So we did that for like, well, we took a little vacation, went down to the pyramids. But  the cool thing about Alexandria is that it's on the Mediterranean coast. And if you picture it,  
**[0:18:41-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:18:41):**  it's like four miles wide, like top to bottom and lengthwise, it's eight miles.  Denver's population is 30 by 30 mile wise, pretty much. So in like a fifth of the area,  they have the same population as Denver, Colorado. And so it was like, people on people pack, but  
**[0:19:04-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:19:04):**  the people were great. Like, we would walk through our little area that had thousands of people in  it. And everybody on the street would holler and, you know, wave and say hello. They were very  kind and polite.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:19:17):**  What year was this that you're in Egypt?  2007. So I think it was like a year and a half or two years before the Arab spring and everything  kind of got a little bit...  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:19:26):**  That would have been the last time I was in that part of the world would have been 2002,  2003.  Oh, got you. Okay.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:19:33):**  And we didn't make very many port calls on Navy cruises after 9-11, if you can imagine that.  For sure. I do have an interesting story about that, though, that I would go out and I would  drink coffee. They were a very night culture. Men would wake up at noon, and they would go  
**[0:19:53-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:19:53):**  to bed at like midnight or no, they would wake up at noon. They would quit work at midnight,  and then they would go out party till like five in the morning.  Sounds like Mediterranean.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:20:04):**  Their version of partying, though, is going to a coffee shop, smoking hookah, and playing  towelette or bat game in their dominoes. And so we're coming back from one of like a night of  drinking coffee and playing bat game. And we're coming back and I see this boy that I see playing  
**[0:20:21-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:20:21):**  in the street all the time, but it's five o'clock in the morning. He's still playing in the street.  And I'm like, why is Ali out in the street? And they're like, because he's playing. It was so  weird. And I was like, yeah, but where's his parents? And they're like, his mom's probably  
**[0:20:35-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:20:35):**  sleeping and his dad is probably out drinking coffee still. Why doesn't anybody care that a  five year old is out in the streets? And they all started laughing. And they said, hey, Chicago.  And I knew enough Arabic to know that they were saying, what is this Chicago? And so I said,  
**[0:20:52-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:20:52):**  why are you asking me if this is Chicago? And he goes, oh, no, it's just a saying we have. It's  like, what are we no better than dirty Americans that we would kidnap our kids in the streets or  shoot somebody? It's like, anytime there's a crime and stuff, people say, hey, Chicago. And I was  
**[0:21:06-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:21:06):**  like, you're kidding. He's like, no, like this kid's fine. And then like a week later, I saw two  guys that had robbed the convenience store, like getting out of the convenience store, and everybody  converged on them and beat the hell out of those two guys. And like, and then my friend that was  
**[0:21:20-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:21:20):**  with me before he goes, this is why we say, hey, does Chicago because we don't have robberies. And  if we do, this is what happens. I was like, okay. Their culture is very intolerant of thievery or  any sort of crime. I think one of the, I think the punishment for thievery in the Quran is chopping  
**[0:21:40-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:21:40):**  off a thief's hand. And that's still practiced as I'm pretty sure in Saudi Arabia. I don't know how  they handle it in Egypt, but like they, that street justice was very, very alive in Alexandria,  because like you never, never worried about, you know, any kind of thing like people robbing you  
**[0:21:58-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:21:58):**  or anything like that. Yeah, they're, you know, I was really young at the time, 19 to 22, 23.  I drank a lot back then. There was probably no time that I felt really unsafe anywhere overseas.  And I've been to Chicago several times. And yeah, you take the wrong turn and go a block in the  
**[0:22:23-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:22:23):**  wrong direction. And white kid with cowboy boots is not in the right place. I can tell you that.  Well, my wife and I talked about it. We would rather raise our, I mean, like if we had to pick  a city, it would be, we would feel safer raising our kid in Alexandria, Egypt, in any major city  
**[0:22:41-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:22:41):**  in the United States. Like it would just, you just feel safer because like, even if you worried about  someone who hated Americans and had that depth of American mindset, the cultural aspect of like  having living in a city block, everybody on that city block views you as, as one of their own. So  
**[0:23:02-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:23:02):**  even like us being there, like people would tell me all the time, like, you have nothing to worry  about here because no one will hurt you because you basically belong to us. You are ours. No one  would mess with you because you're ours. There's a sense of community. Like, I want to say tribalism,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:23:18):**  but that's probably not the right word. And I said it anyway. So there it is. Well, I'd say,  I mean, it's a lot like what you see in the movie Lone Survivor, you know, that in that Hindu Kush,  when they, when they gave that Pashtun, I believe is the word, when they gave that, that protection  
**[0:23:34-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:23:34):**  to Marcus Luttrell, they were ready to fight for the death because of that concept of taking care  of one of their own. Yeah. When they give their word, they're pretty serious people. Yeah. So  as a farm kid, what'd you notice about their agriculture while you were there? I, unfortunately,  
**[0:23:51-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:23:51):**  we pretty much stayed most of the time in the city. I know they did a lot of flood irrigating  from the Nile and just from the beginning of the book, Dirt, like he talks about how, you know, how  their, their act, their flood irrigating in the beginning was very, very beneficial to the region.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:24:15):**  But now the way they've changed it currently is terrible. And they're, they're going to screw  things up pretty bad, but I don't remember what the changes were. And this is one book that  listening to it, I'm like, I'm going back and I'm, I'm like, cause I'm listening to it now, but  
**[0:24:29-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:24:29):**  I'm going back. I'm taking notes. I'm highlighting because it's definitely something I want to use in  the future as a teaching tool to be able to, to speak to people on as far as, you know,  farming principles. Yeah. I'll make sure I check that out and I'll try to get a link for that book  
**[0:24:44-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:24:44):**  in the show notes. So after you came back from Egypt. Came back from Egypt and started a family  and farmed. And the only reason I enjoyed farming is because I love listening to books.  I liked the fact that I'd sit on the tractor and listen to books all day. I liked, you know,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:25:09):**  raising, you know, being around cattle and stuff, but I didn't, I didn't find, I was not passionate  about farming. Like I am now. It was just a job. Okay. And I think the regenerative aspect of that  is what is driven my passion. Okay. So how did you stumble on regenerative agriculture as we're,  
**[0:25:35-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:25:35):**  as we're calling it and start applying those principles? So I was at a buddy's house. And  I don't even know that that was the buzz word. I think most people were still saying sustainable  till about 2017, 18, 19, probably 2019. Most people are still saying sustainable. Yeah. So  
**[0:25:53-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:25:53):**  I was at a, we got invited to a friend's house to play, play cards and play games and stuff. And so  we had eaten dinner and we're, we're sitting down or maybe it was right during dinner and the  daughter had, it was in a class and she was talking about what she was learning about cover crops.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:26:11):**  And I said, Ooh, what's a cover crop. And the dad, my friend Cameron was like, Jay, young,  how do you not know what a cover crop is? I was like, cause I don't know what a cover crop is.  And after he had said that I'd realized I'd heard one other neighbor that had grown and then they,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:26:28):**  they're not a neighbor. They lived in a different County, but they had talked about growing,  you know, turnips and radishes with a beardless triticale to grace cattle on. So that was,  that was my only experience with cover crops. And so I went, instead of playing cards,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:26:43):**  he takes me into his den and he's like, all right, we're going to watch this video. And he,  he starts playing it. And I'm like, I'm thinking this is a five minute video. He's going to show  me in the things like an hour long. And I'm like, no, I came over here to have fun, not to watch  
**[0:26:56-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:26:56):**  a YouTube video. This is going to suck on farming no less, which I don't, I mean, I don't want to  go to somebody's house and watch about somebody else doing my job at somebody else's house.  Like this is dumb. And so, like I said, I'm like, I'm 15 minutes in and I'm watching what he's  
**[0:27:12-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:27:12):**  doing grazing cattle. And I'm like, I can do this. Like, like this is doable. They only get 16 inches  of rain. We only get 16 inches of rain. By the way, they're 16 inches of rain, much different  than my 16 inch rain guarantee. They do not have the pan evaporation that we have. And that's  
**[0:27:31-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:27:31):**  something Roy's to ask Roy, take notes on that. Ask Roy about pan evaporation, how much it pisses  them off when people in South Dakota say, well, we get the same amount of rain as you.  I guess that, yeah, that's a fair point. You know, you're going to lose a lot more,  
**[0:27:46-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:27:46):**  a lot more, I would say evo-transpiration, you know, moisture losses from the soil and the plants  the atmosphere when it's 110 in the blazing sun with 30 mile an hour south wind. Like,  oh, we only get that what, once or twice a summer in the plains? Seems like all week.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:28:05):**  Yeah, some weeks, multiple times a week. Yeah.  And you had, you had that major event, right, that from December 16th last year when that,  the wind event that was 100 mile winds across the state of Kansas? I can't remember how high it was  
**[0:28:24-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:28:24):**  here. It was maybe in the like 60s, 70s here. You remember the day? Yeah, yeah. Like, I think  it was November 14th. It was either 14, 15 or 16. It was the same day the fire, they ended up calling  the four county fire up there, burned like a quarter million acres in a couple of hours.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:28:43):**  That thing was just ripping through there. Is that what you were thinking about?  Well, I think it's, I think that's actually two different events. We had, we later on  in December, because I remember the Ford fire you're talking about that went, you know, went up,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:28:58):**  right, and it burned through that. I can't remember the name of that, but a major seedstock  Angus breeder lost almost all their cows. But yeah, no, so later on in December,  there was a 100 mile an hour wind event that lasted from like 10 o'clock in the morning  
**[0:29:16-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:29:16):**  till three o'clock in the afternoon. Sustainable winds of 100 for a large part of that.  I think I remember the day you're talking about, I think we had something like 68,  but most of the day it was down around 45, 40, 45. I just go hide in the basement.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah. The wind straight up blows me right back into the house at 25 mile an hour.  I guess, and where the ranch is, we're kind of out on top of a ridge.  And so if they say the wind is supposed to be 20 out there, it's 25. If they say it's 30 to 35,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:29:57):**  it's probably 35, maybe close to 40. If it's supposed to be 106, it's two degrees hotter at  the ranch than it is at the nearest forecast point, it seems like. But where I live about  six miles north down the river bottom, a 40 mile an hour wind is nowhere near as  
**[0:30:18-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:30:18):**  horrible down here as it is out on the ranch. Yeah. Can you hear that in the background?  I don't hear anything in the background. Nothing's coming through. You're fine.  Somebody's calling me and it's picking up on my computer in the other room.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:30:35):**  No, we can't hear it. You're fine. Do you need to go check it?  No, I sent him a text message saying I'm still on the Zoom meeting.  Okay. All right. So you got roped into, you thought you were going to play cards  
**[0:30:51-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:30:51):**  and you got roped into watching an hour long YouTube video about farming.  Yeah. And that's when I started doing the research and I came to dad.  And the funny thing about that is, is like I stayed pretty basic for those first  
**[0:31:06-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:31:06):**  like 16, 17, 18, 19, all four of those years was I'm going to focus on what I need to know  about cover crops and raising cattle on cover crops, a little bit of rotational grazing.  But whenever I would hear people talk about the science behind it, hold on one second. This guy is,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:31:30):**  it's dropping off. Mineral just texted me. I thought he did. Is there any way I could go  talk to that guy real quick to make sure that they're okay? Because the guy that works for me  doesn't know what the heck he's doing. No problem. We can take a break. I'll pause right here  
**[0:31:47-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:31:47):**  and we'll be back. All right. And we're back. Yeah. So I had the kids, the kid that works for  me is unloading a semi trailer and he thought it was coming on a flatbed and he freaked out when it  got in the, came out in the semi and didn't think he was going to be able to unload it.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:32:08):**  And so I had to go out and be like, are you just going to drive the Bobcat up and unload it from  the back? It's totally fine. So the kid that works for us, his name's Charles and Charles  just graduated high school and lived in a suburb of Chicago. And he told his parents,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:32:31):**  they're like, what college do you want to go to? What do you want to do? And he's like,  I want to work on a farm. And they're like, what? And he's like, I've thought about it for a long  time. I love the outdoors. I hate school. I want to work on a farm. And so anyway, he, we put it  
**[0:32:46-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:32:46):**  out on indeed that we needed, needed to hire, you know, we're looking for a job and we had a really  bad experience right before him. Like we hired a guy in June and the guy in June, we get done,  we offer him the job. And I was like, dad, we made a mistake. And he's like, what? I said, we just,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:33:05):**  we were so excited about hiring this guy. Like we didn't even ask him for his references and  he didn't offer them. So that's, we should have thought of that as a red flag. We did a terrible  job. And he's like, oh, it'll be okay. So dad, I tell dad, I'm like, call us references anyway.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:33:19):**  Like even though he gave them to us after we hired him, like call him anyway. So he calls them and  the guy's story did not line up at all. And so I said, okay, he started moving into the house  that we have on this property that he was going to live in. I said, give the guy 200 bucks for  
**[0:33:35-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:33:35):**  his troubles for gas money for coming out here and moving in firing now because he lied to us  about his references. Like he's not honest. Like we can't have something that's not honest.  Right. Well, let's see. And I'm like, no, like we did see, like, this is the way it is. And so  
**[0:33:52-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:33:52):**  he, dad's still thinking about it and he has to go into that house to get something.  Um, so he goes in there and in the sink is a makeshift meth bong. So I was like,  yeah, it's like it had plastic on it and it had a liquid and like a Kool-Aid in the bottom,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:34:11):**  had a hole cut into it in a, in a, in a, uh, straw going into it. And dad goes, dad texts me because  dad's never done drugs. And so he texts me, he's like, is this a bong? And I'm like, I don't know.  Yeah. I don't know. Dad never seen one of those before in my life.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:34:29):**  Yeah. So I text the, the share, the deputies that I get, I have a great relationship with them. It  was like, dude, is this a bong? Like, can you test this? You know, the residue on this? He's like,  we could. He's like, I don't know that we want to waste the money on a test for that. He goes,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:34:44):**  but that's what I'm guessing. It is. Where did you find it? And I was like,  Oh, I'll tell you later. So dad calls the guys like, yeah, I think we're going to be good. We,  I, we still gave him the money to, for gas mileage and stuff for going out there. But, uh,  
**[0:34:57-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:34:57):**  yeah. So in interviewing Charles, we, we talked to all of his, his references and one of the guys  that, uh, his reference, Charles has been in the boy Scouts all the way up to the last year of  high school because he loves the outdoors. And like every month he was camping, he's from Illinois.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:35:16):**  And so all the States that surround Illinois, he went to different campsites and camped and  everything. And I talked to the, his reference, who was the scout master. The guy just went on  and on about how great his character is. And so he got a good sign generally. Oh yeah. So like,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:35:33):**  he got here and that's the way it's been. He's a ridiculously hard worker. Um, you know, he,  he doesn't know a lot of things that I would assume somebody would know, but that's the  problem. You shouldn't assume a kid that grew up in the suburbs of Chicago would know some of these  
**[0:35:49-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:35:49):**  things. And so dad has been teaching him how to drive the sprayer. Like you can unload a semi  with a pallet forks on a Bobcat from the back. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, but like, you know, dad taught  him how to do the, the, uh, the sprayer and he picked up on how to drive the sprayer extremely  
**[0:36:08-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:36:08):**  well. Um, and that's not, I mean, I, I hate driving the sprayer because I'm so scatterbrained that  I know that like sometime I'm going to be adding something, I'm going to put them out of order  or, you know, do something like that. So it's nice for me knowing that we have somebody that  
**[0:36:23-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:36:23):**  is going like at 18 is already catching, you know, kept picking up on how to do it. So I'm excited  about that aspect of it. And like, like the, all the other stuff I talked about the character and  everything else is great work ethic. So great kid, glad we hired him much better than the guy right  
**[0:36:40-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:36:40):**  for him. Sounds like it hadn't even been there two weeks and he's already cooking meth in the  kitchen sink. Not a great hire. The funny thing is, is my wife just bought the coffee shop that  she's been working at and, uh, you know, she needs help. And so I was like, you know, you just need  
**[0:36:57-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:36:57):**  to hire someone and we're with another couple. And I think if the other guy that my friend  of this other couple, he goes, uh, says the guy who just hired a meth head and fired him before  he even started working for you. I was like, okay, maybe we should call those references.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:37:14):**  Yeah. Not rushing to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Seems legit. All right. What were we talking about  before you had to go and load the truck? I don't even, I don't even remember. I think I was wrapping  up on the, uh, the, uh, the gate Brown grazing cattle on cover crops. Yeah. Yeah. And you were,  
**[0:37:30-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:37:30):**  uh, I was trying to get you to tell me how you made a transition to regenerative agriculture.  Yeah. So, um, Oh yeah, that's right. Cause the first, the first four years I was only focused  on cover crops and, and grazing cattle on cover crops. Um, whenever I would hear like Dr. Christina  
**[0:37:49-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:37:49):**  Jones, for example, talk about root exudates, um, and aggregates, I would, I would be confused  because I'm like thinking what's an aggregate. And she's already talking on about the function and  and going on with it. And like, um, then I get lost in the whole presentation and I'm like,  
**[0:38:08-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:38:08):**  well, screw, you know, figuring out how, what an aggregate is or why it's important and everything.  I'm, I'm never going to be able to figure out, you know, why, um, I'm never going to be able  to figure out that kind of stuff. So why spend any time, you know, trying to figure it out. So  
**[0:38:24-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:38:24):**  I would stay away from the scientific ass, uh, you know, presentations and only focus on the  practical ones that apply to me. So one day I'm in, um, listening to, I was at a conference and I  went and I sat in on Chris, Dr. Christina Jones, and I felt like I was starting to understand it  
**[0:38:41-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:38:41):**  a little bit better. And then she says, if you don't eliminate synthetic fos from your operation,  you'll never get to where you want to go, um, on your soil health journey, because you'll,  you'll never be able to grow aggregates and produce aggregates like you need to.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:38:57):**  Okay. Why is that? Why is that a critical, why is that critical? I mean, I did a lot of this  soil health and nutrients and, you know, aggregates, root exudates,  but I've never heard that, that specific one before. Yeah. So I, I wrote that down because  
**[0:39:11-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:39:11):**  I was like, I've got to ask this question. And so, and by the way, for you guys that are listening,  if you're ever at a conference, be the person who asks questions. Yes. People that grow,  those are the people that learn, um, chances are somebody else in the room has the same question  
**[0:39:27-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:39:27):**  you are have. They're just too afraid to ask it. And the other thing is, is 90% of those dudes in  that room, you don't know who they are. So why do you care if they think you're an idiot for asking  your question? So I exactly, I've never cared when I'm at a conference of how stupid my question is,  
**[0:39:42-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:39:42):**  because I want to know what my, the answer to my question. And I don't care what everybody else in  that room thinks. So anyway, at the end of it, I wrote down that question I asked her, I said, so  I want to make sure you understand you correctly. If I don't eliminate fos, I won't be able  
**[0:39:56-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:39:56):**  to grow, or I won't be able to, to get where I want to grow because the roots won't produce  aggregates. And she's like, that's correct. I'm like, why? And so she explained it pretty much  this way that when your root or when your roots are in the developing stages, right at the beginning,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:40:16):**  somehow the seed is able to tell and, or the root, once it hits synthetic fos, as soon as it hits  that, it's aware that it needs that fos or that nitrogen. So it quickly expenses all the energy  it can take to produce that, that, that, that growth that it needs. And so it'll use all of  
**[0:40:38-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:40:38):**  its energy and consuming and taking up that nitrogen or fos. Okay. That's not what it should  be doing. What it should be doing is putting out an exudate. And so an exudate is a fine root hair  that comes off of your roots. And so those fine tiny little hairs that are coming off your roots,  
**[0:40:59-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:40:59):**  those exudates are producing a blue or like glomulin, I guess is what they, what they say,  but it's full of sugars and carbon and that sugar and that carbon, it feeds the bacteria and the  fungus. And so they're also sending out some kind of a signal somehow. And so those signals actually  
**[0:41:18-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:41:18):**  attract these bacteria and fungus that don't have eyes. They're attracted by these signals.  They're emitted by the plant's exudate system. So if the plant senses the fos, it won't put out  those exudates. It immediately just takes up the fos and the nitrogen and absorbs it and just  
**[0:41:37-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:41:37):**  starts growing. Well, it stunts the root growth to where the roots are not growing and growing it at  the level that they should be because all their energy is going into that above ground growth now.  And we have a really cool picture of that. And from the presentation I did, and they look up  
**[0:41:53-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:41:53):**  the YouTube video, 200 bushel corn with no nitrogen or fos. I have a picture of that that shows  above ground growth, the corn's like this, where it has synthetic nitrogen and fos. Below ground  growth is like this. And then right next to it, you have corn that has no nitrogen, no fos.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:42:12):**  It's half the size almost, but below ground growth is two thirds greater than the below ground growth.  So the roots are actually longer than the above ground growth on the stuff that has it out there.  And so when she said that at that conference, I had a reality check and I realized I've been  
**[0:42:33-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:42:33):**  a wimp and been using the excuses of, I have dyslexia. I can't read fast. I'm not smart enough.  I, all the excuses that I've had for my past that have held me back in school and caused me to be a  poor student in school that allowed me to have this crutch of you have dyslexia, you're a slow  
**[0:42:53-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:42:53):**  reader. It's okay that your grades suck because you have to work harder than everybody else just  gets C's. I use that as a crutch. And so I realized that I need to get out of that mindset of,  I can't, to, it's going to be harder for me than anybody else, but I'm going to because I can,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:43:09):**  because of, I have a work ethic that is going to be everybody else type mentality. So I decided I  was going to start forcing myself to watch videos, write down when I didn't know a word, what they  meant, positivity, write it down, continue on with the video, go look up that word and then go watch  
**[0:43:28-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:43:28):**  the video again and kind of take that approach rather than it's overwhelming. I don't know what  they're saying and I can't figure it out. And so through that process it helped me to understand  the science a little bit better. And then at this, so that was, I believe 2019 and then 2020,  
**[0:43:47-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:43:47):**  I saw a video or not video. David Johnson was at the CCTA conference and David Johnson.  Thank you. Appreciate that. So that is the Colorado Conservational Tillage Association,  and they put on the High Plains No-Till Conference. I've been there before. They've had me out there  
**[0:44:07-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:44:07):**  speaking more than once, I think. Yep. And that's where we first met. And so anyway,  he gave a presentation, he was the keynote speaker and he talked about,  he did two different talks. So his keynote, he talked about the results that they're seeing  
**[0:44:26-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:44:26):**  and the science behind why Johnson Sioux bioreactors work. And then his breakout  presentation, he talked about what a Johnson Sioux bioreactor is. And so when he gave his  presentation and showed how to build it, I thought two things, because in his presentation, he said,  
**[0:44:44-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:44:44):**  if you build this compost bioreactor, there is a static non-turning compost pile.  If you build them, then you'll be able to over time, reduce your input cost by 85%  on nitrogen and you'll be able to eliminate FOS. Okay. He said that the words eliminate FOS,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:45:04):**  because I'm like, I have to get there because of Dr. Christina Jones. So when he said that,  I said, I thought two things, one, he's crazy. There's no way that you can reduce your inputs  that greatly just by creating compost. And two, I'm all in, because even though he's  
**[0:45:20-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:45:20):**  sounds crazy and I can't wrap my head around how that's even possible. That's the only way I think  that we can get there because I've been watching other people talk about, you know, reducing FOS  to nothing. And I've been trying to do different things to get there with just cover crops and  
**[0:45:37-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:45:37):**  our rotations. And I'm not seeing the same success on our operation. Like I'm seeing Gabe Brown and  these other people talking at these conferences are having success. And so in my mind, I'm like,  this gives me a lot of hope, even though I think it sounds crazy. So we built like, it was less  
**[0:45:52-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:45:52):**  than 10 days after the conference, I had built my first Johnson-Sue bioreactor. Okay. What is  the Johnson-Sue bioreactor and what does it do? The Johnson-Sue bioreactor is a static,  non-turning compost pile. So all other methods of compost that I'm aware of, you mix, you know,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:46:12):**  dry materials with green materials, manure. And you like, if you think of Elaine Ingram's method,  it is a method of putting a certain amount of brown, meaning like leaves or corn stalks,  a certain amount of green. So like grass clippings or green leaves or green plant material,  
**[0:46:33-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:46:33):**  a certain amount of manure. And then I believe there's another aspect of it too. But anyway,  you put that in a cage. Like think of... I pee on my compost pile every once in a while. That seems  to work. Yeah. Well, this is like, it's enclosed with concrete rebar wire that you would do  
**[0:46:55-0:47:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:46:55):**  concrete with. So anyway, you set that up and then you test it and see when it gets to 160 degrees.  And then you break it apart and move the piles. And this is a layman's turn. It's a little bit  less... And this is a layman's terms. I've never done it. So... It seems labor intensive.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:47:12):**  Yeah, it is. So that, and that's the difference between the two. So Elaine Ingram's method  has more nematodes and more protozoa level of microorganisms, but more bacteria, less fungus.  And it's ready quicker, but more labor intensive upfront. So that's Elaine Ingram's method. The  
**[0:47:34-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:47:34):**  Johnson Sue method takes longer. It takes a full year, but it's more fungally dominant to where  what we've seen is close to a one-to-one ratio. And out here, we have extremely bacteria dominant  soils, which allow pigweeds and kochia to grow. It's a great environment for those two weeds.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:47:57):**  Hey, pigweeds are great. They have a deep taproot that breaks up a compaction layer. They're 20,  a lot percent protein. Yeah. And I did a YouTube video on how great the pigweed was because  when I dug up like all summer long as I dug up root systems, the plant that had the most fungi  
**[0:48:16-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:48:16):**  connected to its root system was the pigweed. And so I found that. Okay. Why do you, why,  why do you care about fungus? Okay. Well, that kind of goes with the Johnson Sue. So I'll answer  that question as soon as I kind of wrap up the Johnson Sue deal. So the Johnson Sue bioreactor,  
**[0:48:35-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:48:35):**  it takes a year for it to break down, but A, it never goes anaerobic. It never stinks.  And B, even though it's labor intensive the first day that you make it, when you basically,  you take brown materials and put it inside the bioreactor. Let's back up. You asked what it is.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:48:54):**  I'll explain that a little bit better. The way we build ours is you take a chemical shuttle  and you take the bladder out of the chemical shuttle. So you just have the frame. Yeah. So for  the newest section, newest ones we're doing, you have to do three of them. And you there's,  
**[0:49:13-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:49:13):**  there's five sections to those chemical totes as they cross like that. So there's five sections.  So we cut that middle section out. And so you have a two section parcel that on there. And then you  stack those on top of each other. The reason I stack that I lined them with weed barrier mat,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:49:32):**  and then I stack them. Do you have videos on YouTube? How do you build yours? Okay.  So like, since like, nobody watches this one on YouTube, and probably because I don't really put  them on YouTube. Like, let's just like, keep that simple. Your YouTube channel is,  
**[0:49:49-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:49:49):**  your YouTube channel is Young Red Angus. Yep. I'll make sure that I have a link for that in the show  notes. So if you want to check out Jay's videos on how to actually build one of these Johnson  SUE bioreactors, check the show notes. I'll try to hook you up. So yeah, you stack those on top of  
**[0:50:05-0:50:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:50:05):**  one another so that you can, once the compost breaks down, you can have easy access to it. But  you align those with weed barrier mat on the outside. And then you put five PVC pipes,  evenly distributed through the middle. So four evenly distributed from the corners, eight inches  
**[0:50:20-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:50:20):**  in, and then one in the very center. You fill it full of material, make sure it's wet when you put  it in like 70% water by volume. And I just, he kind of explains that you squeeze it and, you know,  a droplet of water will come out of your knuckles. That kind of gives you an idea of how wet it's  
**[0:50:36-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:50:36):**  supposed to be. Okay. Put those materials in, you can make it with ground up corn stalks or  grass clippings, but the way you put that in there, you pull the pipes out after a day,  and then you just water it. He says a gallon of water per day in our area, at least that's too  
**[0:50:56-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:50:56):**  much water. So we've got it backed off to where once they've broken down after six months,  we just lightly water the top and that keeps it moist enough to be a good product. If you over  water it, you can get anaerobic conditions in the bottom of it. And, you know, if you like  
**[0:51:12-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:51:12):**  in the first year we did it, you know, we didn't realize that. So we were creating anaerobic  conditions by overwatering them. But anyway, the idea is it never goes anaerobic. So that produces,  you know, a fungally dominant compost. And then once you have this fungally dominant compost,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:51:27):**  you apply it to your farm ground and here's where the fungus comes in. So when your plant  is putting out those exudates on its root system, it's sending those signals to bacteria  and mycorrhizal fungus, but also other funguses that would be immediately close to the root system  
**[0:51:48-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:51:48):**  to bring the plant the micronutrients it needs to grow a healthy fruit, vegetable, or grain.  And so right now in our systems, when we're applying 180 pounds of phosphorus, I mean,  I'm sorry, 180 pounds of nitrogen and 40 pounds of phosphorus, that's what we do on our irrigated  
**[0:52:06-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:52:06):**  ground. We're putting out phosphorus and nitrogen and probably a little bit of potassium and the  plant takes those three up, but then it's deficient in boron, it's deficient in manganese,  it's deficient in copper, it's deficient in iron, it's deficient in all the other micronutrients  
**[0:52:21-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:52:21):**  that the plant needs to have a healthy fruit, vegetable, or grain. So now we as the consumers  or your cattle, if they're out eating that residue, they're not getting the micronutrients  that they need to have a healthy functioning growing body that affects, if you listen to  
**[0:52:37-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:52:37):**  Nicole Masters, she talks about how that affects gut health and it basically affects everything.  So our gut health in America and across the world where people are eating vegetables,  fruit, and grain that are in traditional agriculture, we're not as healthy as what we were  
**[0:52:54-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:52:54):**  in the 1930s because we're not eating vegetables, fruit, or grain that has the nutrient density  that they need. That's why regenerative agriculture is so important is because it brings it back.  If you're in a dry, arid environment like we are in western Kansas, that's why Johnson Sue Compost,  
**[0:53:13-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:53:13):**  Elaine Ingram, or any kind of compost that you can get your hands on that is going to bring back  this process quicker is so important because I can grow a cover crop out there or I can  grow a cover crop out there to start to bring back this biology. But as soon as I go through  
**[0:53:29-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:53:29):**  a drought like we went through last year where everything's dead, the biology dies too.  So the biology you brought back with the cover crops then dies and it'll come back with the,  you know, with spores, you know, that are in the ground but the process is so much slower  
**[0:53:45-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:53:45):**  than what it is in areas where they get rained. So adding the biology through the compost is so,  is going to be so, so important and so many people in my area, I've talked to a lot of people in my  area that have tried, you know, cover crops and they're like, oh it doesn't work because of this  
**[0:54:03-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:54:03):**  or it doesn't work because of that. And I think- And you don't need that kind of negativity in your life.  Sure, I agree. What I'm saying is like they blame cover crops and stuff when I think that had they  done a little bit more research and tried or, you know, utilized compost,  
**[0:54:20-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:54:20):**  I think that they would have probably stuck with it a little bit longer. And then there are those  people that want to try it, want to fail so that they can say it didn't work and here's why.  Right, right. So I'm kind of curious as to how disruptive your fungal networks  
**[0:54:38-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:54:38):**  or how disruptive your planting is to your fungal networks but I don't know if we can ever  really kind of peel into that. You mean like planting with a distro? Yeah, yeah.  And the other thing that's kind of on my mind and so last week I went to, as we record this  
**[0:54:58-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:54:58):**  when it comes out, it'll be like three, four weeks ago, I went to the Gail Fuller's Fuller Field School.  This year it was called Healing the Farmer and man I gotta tell you it was cool because there was  maybe 120 people there and it was more women than men. That's awesome. First agricultural  
**[0:55:17-0:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:55:17):**  conference I've ever been to that was more women than men and it was a really young crowd.  Okay, so where were we a couple weeks ago? Bottom line,  yeah, it was a lot of guys our age and older not a whole lot of young people, right?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:55:35):**  Yeah. At Gail's there wasn't hardly like our demographic was a lot thinner than we've come  to expect at conferences. There are still some older folks that had a lot of wisdom to pass on  but it was the demographic definitely shifted younger and female this year for the Fuller  
**[0:55:53-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:55:53):**  Field School which was really cool. So on what was their demographic? Was it like what was their  job? Most of them were women who farmed or women who are in rural America or cities that  wanted to learn more about regenerative agriculture? I'm just going to cop out and say yes  
**[0:56:12-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:56:12):**  because I really don't know. You can't judge a book by its cover obviously but just from  the women that I knew that were there and some of the other stories that I heard, I think it  was pretty balanced. I think there were some women that were definitely doing it,  
**[0:56:30-0:56:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:56:30):**  various stages of their regenerative journey and there were some young women that were from the  city that wanted to get out and learn how to make their own food, grow their own food and be in  touch with nature. It rained the first day so they did the whole morning schedule in town in a  
**[0:56:51-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:56:51):**  building which is not ideal but then for the afternoon went back out to the farm. The first  speaker the second day walked out barefoot. We're outside on the farm barefoot in grass.  Just not something you'd see every day at a farm conference.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:57:16):**  Yeah that's cool. On the fungus on the roots thing too with the pigweeds, that's what I thought was  was really cool is seeing that and I know that the fungus I'm seeing on a pigweed's root so you  can't see mycorrhizal fungus. It's too small to see with the naked eye so what I'm seeing is  
**[0:57:39-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:57:39):**  some type of saprophytic fungus I believe and then there's another fungus that is in our soils  I can't think of it. The saprophytic fungus is break down dead plant material but even those  you know when you think about a Johnson Sioux there's no mycorrhizal fungus in a Johnson Sioux  
**[0:57:57-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:57:57):**  because you know a mycorrhizal fungus needs plant roots to survive and so all of the the  the fungus that is in those Johnson Sioux's and like our best one that we got tested had 305  species of fungus, 365 species of bacteria so 300 species of saprophytic funguses and those  
**[0:58:20-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:58:20):**  those funguses that feed on dead plant material between them and the bacteria 83% of them make  let's see here I always say this wrong it makes organic nitrogen available to the plant. I've  been saying in videos and trying to educate people saying it's inorganic nitrogen.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:58:40):**  I made a video that we dropped yesterday that I had to wait to drop it because Lance is like  great video but you say inorganic nitrogen it's actually organic nitrogen and it needs to be you  know broken down in a form that the plant can take up and I was like great I got to reshoot half this  
**[0:58:57-0:59:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:58:57):**  video. Those terms are kind of a little bit confusing sometimes when it comes to chemistry and  what's the word I'm looking for? I think not natural.  Anyway, it'll come to me nitrogen myth on YouTube, Red Angus, young Red Angus on YouTube.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:59:19):**  It'll be in the show notes. Yeah, so anyway it's cool what like seeing that that biology  in your soil and the other thing too is like everybody hates pigweed. Like they can't stand it.  It's so terrible but I mean it's like you said when we understand what's going on in our soils  
**[0:59:37-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:59:37):**  and we realize hey either whether you believe in evolution or God or whatever like it was put there  and it's there and it's functioning to fix a problem and it is fixing that problem and it is  great at what it does and so when we see it we want to just kill it and hate it. We're not  
**[0:59:57-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=0:59:57):**  realizing that we created the environment for this thing to thrive and so if we don't want  an environment where this thing can thrive then we have to change the environment and while we're on  that process of changing that environment realize thing has a huge tap root. The thing has more sap  
**[1:00:16-1:00:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:00:16):**  like fungus connected to its roots than any other plant that I've been able to find in my system  and that's a jack ton of carbon that it's emitting through its root systems and it's got  a jack ton of carbon from the fibrous roots that are breaking down after it's dead and so yes  
**[1:00:32-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:00:32):**  there's it's it's terrible for so many reasons but it's fantastic for as many reasons and more  and if we can figure out the context of what's going taking place in our soil and we can begin  to change and add more fungus through these these Johnson-Sew bioreactors then we can create an  
**[1:00:52-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:00:52):**  environment where the pigweed is not as likely to thrive and make it easier to kill it so I think  people have to realize that when they think like they have to start thinking completely differently  than what they're they're currently thinking about. I agree if you want to make a small change,  
**[1:01:12-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:01:12):**  change something you're doing. If you want to make a big change, change how you're thinking.  Yes. And so a little bit to kind of continue with the fungal discussion we're having.  Why was it Gail's? I met a guy from his name was Adam from Pacific Substrates and we got to talk  
**[1:01:29-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:01:29):**  and kind of at length about mushrooms and just fungi in general. Yeah I'm glad that you you  mentioned that because I was going to ask you about that because Gail had talked about the  mushrooms and mycelium and being able to eat them to help out with depression and clinical  
**[1:01:49-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:01:49):**  depression. Did you guys talk about that? You're talking about psilocybin mushrooms  and that's not necessarily the direction that I was going to go. Perfect. You fill me in. I'm  excited. That might be that's a future podcast. That's a whole other podcast coming probably  
**[1:02:07-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:02:07):**  not for a while but yeah we'll get there someday. But what Adam and I were talking about,  one of the things was I kind of have this theory like you know with insects 98% of the insects in  the world are beneficial. You know a similar percentage of bacteria can have beneficial  
**[1:02:29-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:02:29):**  functions. You know there's just this very narrow window of organisms whether it's you know fungal  bacteria or insect that are harmful. So here's what I'm getting at in the quest to you know  apply management practice in a bottle fungicide with all the fungicide that's been sprayed in the  
**[1:02:52-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:02:52):**  world and as little as we know about fungi have we killed too much of the beneficial fungus in  the world. Is it just going to take time to get that back with you know doing things like Johnson  Sioux bioreactors and figuring out you know what three or four hundred species of fungi are going  
**[1:03:11-1:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:03:11):**  to grow in that thing and thrive in the farm field. Are you aware of Toby Cures? Educate me,  sir. So she's she I don't know if you've got a chance to watch the full one on on the nitrogen  myth but so I mentioned her in the end of that video that I found her video the end of this  
**[1:03:31-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:03:31):**  summer it was in July because I remember I put it put it on in the background while I was doing  something else and so her research is amazing through what they're doing they've been able to  find that plants know or yeah so fungus is able to tell which plants in an environment are feeding  
**[1:03:54-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:03:54):**  them more carbon so those fungus will bring them the mic they'll they'll discriminate and they will  go to the plants that are bringing giving them more carbon and they will bring and feed more  micronutrients to those plants and then it's up to those plants to decide when they have too much  
**[1:04:10-1:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:04:10):**  and give it to the other plants around them or whatever but they're they're able to find through  her research that that fungus discriminates on what plants get what based on which plants are  benefiting them it's almost like the soil is its own living organism yeah crazy so she she actually  
**[1:04:31-1:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:04:31):**  is is going around the world and getting different samples of fungus to classify as many fungus as  possible and then her hope is is that we can identify the ones that are going extinct and  begin to make them protected species that are are protected like like wildlife are protected  
**[1:04:54-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:04:54):**  you know and it's funny because 10 years ago I would have thought that's crazy and stupid  and now just based on what you find out through history and how we've destroyed so many things  when we're not put in check milkweed yeah so I think that there's there's so many uh so many  
**[1:05:14-1:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:05:14):**  fungus count like like you said about going extinct you know like how many do we already  kill from years and years of tillage that that were in our soils that probably won't come back  I don't think we'll ever know yeah but what I do know is I gotta pay a bill real quick so we're

**[1:06:57-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:06:57):**  you know just like the uh oh marketing and promotioning uh the aspect of of youtube that  like you know i don't necessarily care for that aspect of it but once you tap into that it allows  you to do other things that you probably you know you wouldn't have had access to and it's something  
**[1:07:18-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:07:18):**  that it's like the quality of videos you know when we first started it was just a single shot  the entire time me telling a story and now it's it's you have so much b-roll which is the you know  you're talking oh yeah so it's like you have to you i didn't want to learn about b-roll or  
**[1:07:37-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:07:37):**  cinematography or all that stuff but i realized um man i i if i'm gonna tell the story and i'm  gonna tell it well and i'm gonna get people's attention i have to be better at these things  i hate and i suck at and so it's like clickbaity titles and yeah exactly or yeah and thumbnails  
**[1:07:54-1:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:07:54):**  that like i i would rather just youtube pick the thumbnail now i'm i'm taking you know 30 minutes  to make a thumbnail that i think looks stupid but it has my face on it and youtube tells me  you know thumbnails that have your big dumb face on it are more likely to get clicked on for  
**[1:08:12-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:08:12):**  whatever reason yep anyway it's like it's like that one i posted yesterday the click-through  rate is 15 percent my channel average is six percent and so it's like whatever i did with  that thumbnail is actually working and it's like those are things i would have never thought of  
**[1:08:31-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:08:31):**  a year ago that now just like through looking through things and it's like you with that that  advertise you know with that advertisement it's like i don't want to have to pursue people to talk  to them about advertising on my youtube channel but at the same time like if i have that attitude  
**[1:08:48-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:08:48):**  i can have that attitude i can have okay who are the companies that i already work with that i love  that i would like for other people to work with like regen ad labs and so it's like it makes sense  to reach out to regen ad labs because they're a company i already believe in and if i can help  
**[1:09:03-1:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:09:03):**  them they can help me like why am i not you know looking out for looking to to promote them hey we  can't give away all the secrets we can't give away all the secrets on the podcast until we have them  all figured out and have have them applied right but this sounds like a great discussion that you  
**[1:09:20-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:09:20):**  and i should have when the recording is not going fair enough because i i figured out i figured out  a few things too and i'm i'm definitely you know working on that working on you know trying to you  know trying to do more self-promotion which i honestly suck at i mean look if i was good at  
**[1:09:36-1:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:09:36):**  self-promotion i'd be good at a market i'd be a better marketer if i was a better marketer i  wouldn't be in the cattle business i'd be you know going out making a living selling something  on commission and being really good at it yeah so back to fungus yes back to fungus  
**[1:09:51-1:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:09:51):**  what was the what was your question on on fungus follow-up um do you see any do you have any  fruiting fungus that you see in your crop fields oh man i uh i went through doing fungus we're  talking about like you know a toadstool or a mushroom cap or a little goomba or whatever right  
**[1:10:10-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:10:10):**  yeah so um i uh i we're drilling wheat at the beginning of september which is rare for us  um because we typically try to like try to plant wheat around the 15th of september  um and anyway so let me i gotta find this this conversation so i can  
**[1:10:32-1:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:10:32):**  hold this up so you can see it i basically i found a mushroom that was  it is the biggest mushroom i've ever seen let's see if i can hold up to the deal see my hand in  there holy crap that's that's eight inches probably across that was on our farm ground  
**[1:10:52-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:10:52):**  right where i was drilling wheat yeah so he he showed a picture of a mushroom mushroom cap that  was probably um it was probably six inches tall yeah and and the the mushroom cap was about eight  inches around that's pretty serious mushroom yeah so before before johnson soon before regenerative  
**[1:11:11-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:11:11):**  agriculture i rarely saw mushrooms on any of our ground now every time it rains mushrooms sprout up  and that's wonderful and and that's i think that's something that farmers need to be aware of like  we need to be aware that fungus is critical to growing healthy crops and i i think so many times  
**[1:11:34-1:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:11:34):**  like farmers are just focused on yield and on having the best yield and so when their focus  is on let's have the best yield they miss out on all these other aspects that are so important  important that we're not even focused on like why are there so many more people that have celiac's  
**[1:11:53-1:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:11:53):**  disease than there were 50 years ago why are there so many more people that have autoimmune disorders  than there were 50 years ago why do we you know like start beginning to ask the questions why do  we see these things and you know when i i think i was even in uh doing cover crop still i really  
**[1:12:13-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:12:13):**  pushed back on people who are pro-organic and i really pushed back on people that  would talk about the dangers of glyphosate and the dangers of different kind of chemicals because  i didn't see any other way to farm without those things and so like it was almost like they were  
**[1:12:31-1:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:12:31):**  challenging my way of life and telling me that my way of life was wrong and bad and now you know  like as i've that's that's why it's so hard to have sometimes just a simple conversation with  another producer because just asking them a simple question why do you spray so much glyphosate  
**[1:12:52-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:12:52):**  it's you know they can almost take that as an attack on their very identity it's like  you're attacking the core of their being by asking them why they use glyphosate like no dude it's just  a simple question like trust me i've gotten plenty heat on social media for asking people  
**[1:13:06-1:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:13:06):**  if you got to feed hay for 200 plus days a year does it make sense to ranch where you're at  like i think that's a pretty reasonable question honestly apparently if you're somewhere where you  feed hay for over 200 days a year and you have cows that's an offensive question yeah well and  
**[1:13:22-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:13:22):**  so i think like to like the thing is though is like whenever you are in the process of having  of having your eyes open sometimes reflecting on those truths are offensive you have to accept  that glyphosate is bad for you it's bad for your soil and it's bad for your plants and so  
**[1:13:49-1:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:13:49):**  is it a tool that we we use occasionally to to be able to stop weeds so that we can even grow plants  yes it is but can we find a way to drastically reduce the amount of times that we spray it to  where we're only making one glyphosate application a year instead of five or six yes we can um can i  
**[1:14:10-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:14:10):**  imagine a world where where i don't use glyphosate no but does that mean i can't ever get there no  it doesn't like i we can if we try things and we investigate and we study and we research and we  try new things i believe eventually we'll get to a place where we're not using any kind of you know  
**[1:14:29-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:14:29):**  herbicides i can't imagine that right now but that doesn't mean that we'll we'll get there i  didn't i didn't think it was possible to eliminate phosphorus three years ago and but you did it  anyway yeah and now we're on this year we'll want to apply any phosphorus and i don't apply and plan  
**[1:14:46-1:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:14:46):**  and applying any phosphorus anytime soon because according to the the test that region ag labs did  on our soil most of our irrigated ground and i'm guessing our dry land's not too far off  our irrigated ground has 1200 pounds of phosphorus in it and most of that's tied up to calcium  
**[1:15:07-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:15:07):**  and so 1200 pounds of phosphorus is the equivalency of 5 000 pounds of mez we typically apply  40 pounds of phos in the form of mez so 40 pounds um i have no idea what you're talking about can  you like explain that like i'm five maybe perfect so the two main uh fertilizers that people that  
**[1:15:32-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:15:32):**  people that farmers use are nitrogen and and phosphorus and a form of phosphorus is mez so it's  a it's a dry granular form of phosphorus that you can apply to your ground when you drill your wheat  you can put like if you it goes in the seed furrow yeah it goes in the seed furrow with with your  
**[1:15:54-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:15:54):**  uh with your seed so phosphorus um in the form of mez like you typically apply 40 pounds of it  in our area 40 pounds per acre 40 pounds per acre so when he when we do that that that soil sample  and it's showing us that we have 1200 pounds of phosphorus to get 1200 pounds of phosphorus you  
**[1:16:19-1:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:16:19):**  need to apply 5 000 pounds of mez so to apply 5 000 pounds of like if i if we have 5 000 pounds of mez  sitting in our soil the equivalency of it it means that we have 130 years of phosphorus stockpiled in  our soils from over applying phosphorus for years the reason we have that much phosphorus stockpiled  
**[1:16:45-1:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:16:45):**  is because we've had years of applying mez at 40 pounds when you apply it at 40 pounds when it goes  into the soil immediately like it has a negative charge to it so the negative charge means that it  wants to bind with positively charged you know like what do you call those ions particles so  
**[1:17:08-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:17:08):**  it has that that negative charge well it wants to bind with things that have a positive charge well  calcium has a positive charge so when you put out that synthetic phos the calcium that you do have  in your soils binds with that false okay so when a plant goes into the soil and it senses that  
**[1:17:26-1:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:17:26):**  phos it takes up that phos but 80 percent of that phos immediately ties up so when it's tied up to  calcium the plant does not have access to it so how do you get your fas untied from your calcium  fungus and bacteria so when you are applying the johnson's stew extract that that bacteria in that  
**[1:17:46-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:17:46):**  fungus is able to go to that that the the phos and the calcium and break it apart and make it  turn it into a soluble form and it brings it to the plant and so since we have all that stockpile  of phos in our ground if you're applying this synthetic or if you're applying the johnson's  
**[1:18:06-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:18:06):**  stew compost you're applying saprophytic funguses and beneficial bacteria that will bring the plant  the phos and the calcium that's already there tied up in your soils and so we don't need to be  applying phosphorus like i it will be 135 years before whoever farms my ground will ever have to  
**[1:18:26-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:18:26):**  apply phosphorus again okay unless whoever takes over my farm ground ends up going back to  uh tillage moldboard plow probably um let's just hope that you're around a good long years to  steward that land now we talked about johnson's stew bioreactors kind of got in depth but where we  
**[1:18:44-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:18:44):**  left off we didn't talk about the product that they made okay and and what do you do with it and  so the question i have you know you started off by saying that you know you guys farm eight  thousand acres okay and you're talking about making like five or six chemical totes worth  
**[1:19:04-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:19:04):**  of compost how are you spreading that out across your acres yeah great question so to make an  extract there's there's three ways to get this into your field you can apply it in furrow so  every single way that you're going to do this you're going to make an extract that you can  
**[1:19:22-1:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:19:22):**  apply in furrow you can treat the seed or you can do a foliar application so to do any of the three  of those you have to make you have to take your your compost and you have to make a liquid extract  and let's be clear i should have said this earlier when i first started talking about it when i talked  
**[1:19:38-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:19:38):**  to people about johnson's soup compost they're like oh yeah we use compost manure like no not  even close to the same thing um so the reason it's not is because you know you're composting that  manure and it is you know becoming a form that's easier to break down in your soil and it's better  
**[1:19:56-1:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:19:56):**  than just putting straight manure on your soil but when you're getting it from a feedlot you're going  to have the it's going to be full of salts um so this this compost is a fungally dominant compost  and hold up i'm not going to let that one go by if you're getting your manure from a feedlot  
**[1:20:13-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:20:13):**  it's probably full of antibiotics too okay yeah sure yeah okay so you're going to have to  that yeah another great point to bring out so anyway so when you have johnson soup compost  you have a compost that has a ratio close to one to one on your bacteria to fungus to bacteria  
**[1:20:34-1:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:20:34):**  ratio and so when you're applying um this to your your ground then it is it is you know acts  getting more access to your fungus and bacteria and that's why it's it's important to differentiate  between compost manure and johnson soup compost so when you make your liquid extract we have a  
**[1:20:56-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:20:56):**  machine and you guys you can put that in the show note too if you want to soil works makes a machine  called the bio5 extractor and so they also make a compost called bio5 and i'll talk about that  is that just soil w r w o r k s yep okay so got it um so i'll put it in there and if hopefully if  
**[1:21:19-1:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:21:19):**  they get any sales they'll let me know that's right um the bio5 um makes a uh or they make  that extractor and so we extract our compost from that bio5 extractor and so when you extract  compost basically you need to put the compost in water and you need it to separate the the compost  
**[1:21:42-1:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:21:42):**  and that the they're separating the bacteria and the fungus and getting that in the in the  atmosphere of the water um and breaking the compost apart through the through the water so  that extraction process takes about 20 minutes if you just picture a cone with holes on the bottom  
**[1:22:00-1:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:22:00):**  that blows air up through it um that's how that's the rough estimate if you if they want more  information than that they'll have to go watch a youtube video that i have or or soil works as  on the bio5 extractor and so that that that extracts the the compost and then you want to  
**[1:22:15-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:22:15):**  put in two pounds of compost for eight gallons of water so one to four okay compost for eight  gallons and that's how you make your extract so when we're doing corn we make it in furrow or we  put it on in furrow so instead of putting down a liquid phos with the planter we're putting down  
**[1:22:35-1:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:22:35):**  a liquid extract with the corn seed okay and so that's how we're getting on with our corn  the last two years this next year we'll do that but we're also going to treat our corn seed  and so they're going to treat it with compost extract compost extract so now when you treat  
**[1:22:51-1:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:22:51):**  the most when you think of best bang for your buck the best bang for your buck is treating seed  and i was told that by david johnson and i was told that by lance gungerson and so since i was  talking to lance i was able to push back and be like okay that makes no sense to me to me in  
**[1:23:08-1:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:23:08):**  furrow would be the best way why is treating the seed the best way because if in furrow you're  getting those the biology into the ground and it seems like they would produce better than it being  absorbed into the into the oh it makes sense to me i mean because as soon as that seed coat breaks  
**[1:23:26-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:23:26):**  yeah it's going to have like that that that compost extract and the fungal and bacterial  species that are in there you know 600 300 roughly of each they're going to have immediate access to  that corn plant to that corner and that's that's what my thought process was but apparently and  
**[1:23:42-1:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:23:42):**  this is research done by dr james white out of ruthers university bacteria and fungus have  little things called endophytes and so these endophytes when a plant when the when the fungus  and the bacteria are in the soil and they come in contact with the root system the plant root system  
**[1:24:02-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:24:02):**  will actually absorb the bacteria and the fungus through these endophytes and so they what they did  was and i don't i don't james white just found this research from people in the philippines and  i don't i can't pronounce their names to give them credit but if you watch any of james white stuff  
**[1:24:19-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:24:19):**  he always gives them credit but they they died um yeast and they died bacteria until they found  strands that would survive being died by fluorescent chemical and so once they died those  they put the seed in the petri dish and looked at it under a microscope with a black light and they  
**[1:24:39-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:24:39):**  were able to watch the back the fungus and the bacteria be absorbed into the plant root system  and go up into the plant and then they would be there for a time period and then they would go to  the tip of the root and be shot back out into the atmosphere so what they discovered is is that the  
**[1:24:56-1:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:24:56):**  plant the the bacteria and the fungus go to the plant they're absorbed the endophytes are absorbed  into the root system and then these endophytes are what actually delivers the plant the micronutrients  it needs once the plant has sucked out the the back the the in or sucked out the micronutrients  
**[1:25:13-1:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:25:13):**  through these endophytes it goes back to the tip of the roots and then is shot back out into the  the the atmosphere the rhizosphere the the area connected the plant root and goes and gets more  micronutrients and then comes back to the plant and feeds it and so it's a circular  
**[1:25:28-1:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:25:28):**  system of being fed back and forth uh into the plant root system and so anyway  um as uh shoot i lost my complete train of thought what were we talking about before that with the  we're talking about nutrients cycling in the soil yeah so why did i start talking about dr james  
**[1:25:51-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:25:51):**  why oh how did we get it on okay great how do we get it onto the seed so that's why that's so funny  that's why coating the seed is so important is because once you coat the seed those endophytes  penetrate the seed and you can treat your wheat seed and plant it a year later and it will still  
**[1:26:10-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:26:10):**  have the same response and so what happens when the seed is treated is that it already has the  bacteria and the fungus like treated in the seed so it immediately shoots out the roots and shoots  out exudates the first response it has even in crappy soil you can take that seed and put it in  
**[1:26:28-1:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:26:28):**  tilled soil and it's going to respond like that and what it does is it excites the bacteria spores  and funguses or the spores from the fungus and the bacteria that's already in your soil it will it  will stimulate growth just from doing that and it's the quickest way to get response in the build  
**[1:26:45-1:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:26:45):**  biology in your soil is treating the seed and it's better than doing it in furrow because when you do  it in furrow the plant has to figure out it's there and you have to hope that when it goes in  furrow a droplet of that extract hit the seed immediately so it has that response if it doesn't  
**[1:27:01-1:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:27:01):**  hit that the droplet doesn't hit the seed then you have to wait for the plant to put out the exudates  and to reach out and so if you're in a healthy system where you've been doing regenerative  agriculture it'll have the response because it'll sense the biology as soon as it goes in the soil  
**[1:27:15-1:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:27:15):**  because you've built up the biology through regenerative agriculture if you have a conventional  system and you're just getting started then you definitely want to treat the wheat the wheat seed  the corn seed or the cover crop seed before you get it in there and then lastly is the foliar  
**[1:27:30-1:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:27:30):**  application so when guys are doing foliar applications this is the least bang for your buck  as far as like how far the compost can go because you know you gotta be spraying that like foliar  like 20 gallons an acre so when we think about the process it's 20 gallons an acre for foliar  
**[1:27:46-1:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:27:46):**  eight gallons an acre for um oh doing um in furrow but then when you think about like if i'm able to  treat uh 500 bushels with 70 gallons i'm able to do uh 70 acres or i mean i'm able to do 500 acres  on 70 gallons of compost so the most efficient and then is also the most effective is just treating  
**[1:28:16-1:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:28:16):**  the seed and so anyway um the foliar application though is mind-blowing in itself though because  uh do you know what stripe rust is uh sounds like a fungus that affects leaves and makes like red  streaky stripey thingies on the leaves yeah nailed it so it really affects um wheat in our area so  
**[1:28:37-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:28:37):**  stripe rust is a parasitic fungus that attacks the the the leaf of the of the plant um this is one of  the most fascinating things that excites me a lot that i found out through this whole process  there is not a saprophytic or no sorry there's not a parasitic fungus that can't be killed by  
**[1:28:58-1:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:28:58):**  a beneficial fungus so every species of a parasitic fungus is lower on the food chain to a beneficial  so when you have this this uh compost that you make and you apply a foliar application you  spray that on your plants what happens is that lands on the leaf and it's absorbed into the  
**[1:29:17-1:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:29:17):**  stomata of the of the leaf system and so anyway once it's absorbed the plant actually knows  which funguses are going to benefit it and which ones won't and so it can it will feed the  beneficial ones with exudates and i didn't realize this but the the leaves actually put out exudates  
**[1:29:35-1:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:29:35):**  as well and so those exudates on the leaves will feed the beneficial fungus and bacteria and the  ones that that it doesn't need even though they may be beneficial they won't feed them and so like  they'll actually absorb into the stomata of the of the leaf and then the um those fungus and  
**[1:29:54-1:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:29:54):**  bacteria on the leaves will actually absorb micronutrients that land onto the onto the leaf  now i where you're at in uh in oklahoma i know the wind never blows there hey i'm not in oklahoma  i'm just still in kansas by like 20 miles so anyway i know the wind never blows there  
**[1:30:14-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:30:14):**  until you're in colorado that's right so anyway the um the you know when we have dust events and  we get dust on our our plants leaves they're able to break down those micronutrients that are coming  in the dust and absorb it into the stomata of the leaf and so i suppose it stands to reason  
**[1:30:38-1:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:30:38):**  you know human beings we have you know we carry we're we're walking sack of microbes covered in  bacteria it stands to reason that plants would have a similar relationship with fungi that  there's you know fungi all through the plant structure and you know on the outside that we  
**[1:30:55-1:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:30:55):**  can't really necessarily see or detect so once that once that absorbs those fungus and bacteria  to the stomata that fungus and bacteria lives within the plant's stomata and so when when when  parasitic funguses they they can't survive and so either they're killed immediately they don't even  
**[1:31:12-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:31:12):**  know what the process is either stripe rust avoids those fields or when they get to those fields  they're killed immediately either way if you spray your wheat with compost extract you will never  have a parasitic fungus attack your plant because it's impossible and that's probably cheaper than  
**[1:31:31-1:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:31:31):**  most fungicide well if you consider like the the materials that go into my bioreactor i was able  to make four bioreactors with uh a hundred dollar excuse me a hundred dollars worth of uh of wheat  straw so i made four bioreactors with a hundred dollars of wheat straw i you know that ends up  
**[1:31:52-1:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:31:52):**  breaking down to i think they said uh three to six hundred pounds uh on different uh sizes of  bioreactor so let's to be safe let's say it's 300 pounds times four uh divided by uh let's see here  it'd be 300 acres for let for less than yeah three dollars an acre basically in cost to spray for  
**[1:32:23-1:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:32:23):**  spray for um stripe rust with the extract as opposed to over 20 an acre to kill stripe rust  and once you go in and you spray to kill the stripe rust that herbicide is like dropping  a bomb and killing all the beneficial fungus that's out there so you spray for that fun that  
**[1:32:42-1:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:32:42):**  that uh to kill that that stripe rust well what's going to come back in two weeks your  beneficials aren't coming back more stripe rust is coming back yeah if you have wet spring all  you're doing is making that plant more susceptible to stripe rust by spraying it to kill the stripe  
**[1:32:59-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:32:59):**  rust in the first place makes perfect sense dad said he said well if you're going to spray for  something that's job security because once you start spraying it you'll always have it  and there was a time i didn't believe that but you know he was right yeah he was right once you  
**[1:33:21-1:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:33:21):**  start spraying for a plant or trying to control something like killing it you're always going to  have that problem well and the cool thing that we found we started interstating cover crops into our  corn in uh 2020 what we did was we bought a 20-foot john deere distrille that hooks up to the back of  
**[1:33:40-1:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:33:40):**  the three-point and so we dropped it's on 10-inch spacing so we dropped every third row so that we  get to put two rows of cover crops in between the growing corn okay and so we started doing that and  i i thought i would be able to see a huge benefit on days of grazing and i didn't see that benefit  
**[1:33:58-1:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:33:58):**  of days of grazing i think we were planting our cover crops too late but this year i found an  unexpected benefit we had two circles right next to each other one got cover crops interseeded in  between the rows the other one had a little bit more weed pressure and so my dad was concerned  
**[1:34:16-1:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:34:16):**  that we wouldn't be able to to kill the weeds later and so he wanted to be able to spray the  weeds and not kill the cover crops and so we did cover crops on the one and not cover crops on the  other so uh in early august our agronomist said you have to spray to kill the spider mites on  
**[1:34:35-1:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:34:35):**  this circle that did not have cover crops the circle that did have cover crops we did not have  to spray for spider mites and the reason is is because it was full of bees and ladybugs that  were attracted to the flowering buckwheat that was growing out in our corn so it was full of bees it  
**[1:34:51-1:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:34:51):**  was full of ladybugs and did not have spider mites that were being killed by the ladybugs  and so now i'm pretty confident we're going to interseed cover crops and everything trying to  get as many beneficial species out there to kill the spider mites so that we don't ever have to  
**[1:35:06-1:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:35:06):**  spray for spider mites so off the top of your head what was the difference between the field  you had to spray for spider mites versus the next closest one with cover crops so i i i our cost was  less than 20 bucks an acre in the cover crop seed and i know that we were over 20 an acre to spray  
**[1:35:27-1:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:35:27):**  for the spider mites was there was there a significant difference in field yield per acre  we're gonna find out they're neither one of them have been cut yet but oh you guys haven't picked  them yet okay sorry yeah the field that that had the uh spider mites has started dying quicker  
**[1:35:44-1:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:35:44):**  because the leaves that had the spider mites on them died or you know that they were attacked by  the spider mites so i'm interesting i'm assuming that we're gonna have a little drag from that  yeah we'll know when we get the combine out so i had a little corn garden which did not turn out  
**[1:36:02-1:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:36:02):**  well um you know hair heirloom heirloom seeds and i was reading massa nuka fuku waka whatever one  straw revolution i was listening to it when i was planting my corn so like i just kind of went out  watered it forked it a little bit to loosen up the soil poked about an inch and a half whole and  
**[1:36:26-1:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:36:26):**  dropped a germinated corn seed in it like 98 of what i planted came up everything came up  you know boot four leaf everything looked great nothing pollinated and then and then i started  getting ear rot on stuff that did actually like i'd have a half a pollinated ear that started  
**[1:36:45-1:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:36:45):**  getting ear rot in it and some of the some of the seeds or some of the kernels actually started  sprouting on the ear have you ever heard of that so it put out an ear without put having husks on  it and it just started having kernels on it no it had a husk on it everything i mean everything  
**[1:37:04-1:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:37:04):**  looked right but you kind of peel the husk back and a lot of would have would have fungi would  it be rotting okay and it it doesn't make any sense to me because it was just it's been so hot  and dry um and then some of the seeds on on the cob some of the kernels on the cob had broken  
**[1:37:25-1:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:37:25):**  open and sent out a root tiller that's interesting i yeah i i've seen to where we've had um oh uh  they call it corn smut it's um i can't think of the name of it in mexico but it's actually  yeah the blue stuff yeah this mexican truffles that they they make tacos out of  
**[1:37:47-1:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:37:47):**  i had some of that but i'm not that brave yeah i i i cooked some of ours just trying it as long  as you get it early on in the early stages it just tastes like regular mushrooms that you would  you would fry up um what what type of corn was it was a jimmy red or was it  
**[1:38:02-1:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:38:02):**  a blue maize or something else well i planted some atomic orange which is like a 70 80 day corn  dwarf corn um that looked real good up until about the third week of june when it got hot  and it just it didn't do anything i think i got two ears out of probably 200 plants yeah um and  
**[1:38:22-1:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:38:22):**  then i planted um like 400 plants of wage giant indian corn and it's supposed to be eight nine  foot uh 105 110 day corn advertised this 12 inch long multi-colored you know 12 inch long  cob with multi-colored kernels i didn't get any i like you know they're showing pictures of these  
**[1:38:44-1:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:38:44):**  cobs they're supposed to look like baseball bats and all this beautiful pretty multi-colored corn  all the way around yeah i got like two crappy ears this long i mean there's there's a few more  out there drying out but uh i'm gonna try to reseed them next year i'll plant half seeds that  
**[1:38:59-1:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:38:59):**  i grew this year from that patch and i'll plant half of another variety get some compost for me  try again and we can treat your seed and then spray your plants as a drone we'll see if that  helps you yeah for sure that should take care of the the the fungus that's attacking the plant at  
**[1:39:16-1:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:39:16):**  least yeah well we'll have to communicate see if you're going to be anywhere where i'm going to be  in the next few months and bring me a gallon or two that sounds great cool cool i might even uh  yeah yeah so we're kind of a we're kind of running long like i mean we can keep going however long as  
**[1:39:34-1:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:39:34):**  you want to um but i think what i'd what i'd like for our listeners to hear about is i mean this  has been great conversation i think that's kind of needed to get out there to talk about you know how  to go from let's just say how to go from any one of your neighbors that's doing nothing that you're  
**[1:39:55-1:40:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:39:55):**  doing right they're still doing full tillage a lot of chemicals pumping a lot of water and barely  scraping by you know with you know 180 190 bushel irrigated corn how does somebody go from that  system to where you are and what kind of lessons that you know now do you wish you knew when you  
**[1:40:16-1:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:40:16):**  started uh i i definitely wish i would have known about compost and compost extracts but  i think part of it is accepting that like everything is a journey you know like i had to  i had to come to a place where i could accept that i can understand all this i just have to work my  
**[1:40:35-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:40:35):**  butt off like i have to work harder and i think that that's part of the problem is is like i i've  got really close friends that find it fascinating what we're doing and they'll say to me i don't  know that you know i had the ability like i could put the time in to figure it out well though my  
**[1:40:53-1:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:40:53):**  friends that say that like they have to come to a place where they accept that's that's not an excuse  i i have to learn this because i have to stop killing i have to to you know want and care about  the future of our soils you know if we're losing uh you know the beginning of that that uh that  
**[1:41:12-1:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:41:12):**  book dirt it says that every year in america we lose enough topsoil to fill the back of a pickup  for every family in america so it's totally not shocking yeah totally not shocking to me and you  yeah and if we're losing that much then we have to we have to realize that it eventually it's going  
**[1:41:38-1:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:41:38):**  to be gone and you know let's let's put it in context for a second okay you said a pickup load  for every for every person in america every family everything every family okay that's  it's still a lot of pickups i mean that's you know 100 100 million on pickups  
**[1:41:57-1:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:41:57):**  five tons an acre is kind of the coast to coast average that i've heard it's a five tons  loss per acre every year yeah oh wow in a conventional cropping system and that's you  know wind and water erosion so okay what does five tons an acre look like that's a sheet of paper  
**[1:42:17-1:42:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:42:17):**  yep okay yeah and let's let's put it let's continue to like try to put this in perspective  okay so if you go down to a dirt pit and you wanted to buy dirt you can buy dirt for ten  dollars a ton so if you're losing five tons an acre it's ten dollars a ton at your local dirt pit  
**[1:42:37-1:42:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:42:37):**  let's not even talk about how much it's going to cost to haul it and spread it back out on  uniform thickness let's just cost the cost of purchase you're going to spend 50 an acre every  year to replace the top soil that washed off your farm now for all you farm credit guys and all you  
**[1:42:54-1:43:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:42:54):**  banker guys why are we loaning farmers three thousand plus dollars an acre to go buy a farm  and raise tillage monocrop corn and let five dollars or let five tons an acre of their soil  wash down the creek or blow away every year because that's your value too mr banker mr farm credit  
**[1:43:15-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:43:15):**  yeah and so i think the other thing like so like going from going from where they're at now  to to being able to to do regenerative agricultural principles like you have to be get like at at some  point like my journey was i want to raise cattle and that's what got me in and so because i wanted  
**[1:43:36-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:43:36):**  to raise cattle i started accepting all the other things that i didn't want to accept or believe  about my about what i was doing you know and i think everybody has to have this aha moment  where they realize like you know this is like people may get into it because they hear youtube  
**[1:43:53-1:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:43:53):**  video that i give and i say that we save 170 000 in in nitrogen input cost you know that's the  purpose of making the nitrogen video i want to appeal to their pocketbook i i want them to change  you know regardless i don't care if you change because you realize you're destroying  
**[1:44:11-1:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:44:11):**  the environment and you're destroying your own ground and that we're having areas of the great  barrier reef that are dying and we have dead zones off the coast of of uh of uh louisiana and the gulf  coast like i want you to stop because of that but if you won't listen to that that's fine listen and  
**[1:44:29-1:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:44:29):**  hear that you can save 170 000 acre or 50 bucks an acre to 100 an acre depending on how much you're  spending i'll appeal to you either way but i want to appeal to you because my goal is to get as many  people to do this as possible because i believe we have to change if we want a future and so  
**[1:44:46-1:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:44:46):**  i think for people getting started the most important thing in my area is learning how to do  compost and if you don't want to learn how to do compost then buy compost from one of the many  people that sell it because we i didn't get to talk about the bio5 but we applied bio5 at um  
**[1:45:04-1:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:45:04):**  the same rate you know eight gallons an acre with four you know uh two pounds for eight gallons we  applied that in in furrow and i think we raised some of the best silage corn that we've raised  and so it basically performed just as good as the johnson soup compost so really like  
**[1:45:22-1:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:45:22):**  your our ground is so starved for the biology that that the bio5 stuff is just as effective  as johnson soup even though it doesn't have the same you know fungal component it has other stuff  in it has a lot of humics and it has like it's a great product um so anyway whether or not you're  
**[1:45:41-1:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:45:41):**  doing making your own or buying bromo casting or or this bio5 get it into your soil and then start  to watch youtube videos and read books and educate yourself so that you can start to make decisions  based on your knowledge of what's taking place in your soil rather than making a decision based on  
**[1:46:00-1:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:46:00):**  history and one of the things i said in my presentation at the bottom line conferences  is we have to stop being offended that we're telling people that tillage is is wrong and it's  bad for the environment it's bad for our ground we take that and we're offended by that you're  
**[1:46:15-1:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:46:15):**  saying my granddad my great-grandfather were destroying the environment yes and it's okay  because they didn't know they were they were doing the best that they could with the tools  that's been given to them i'm giving you brand new tools and so now you can decide what you're  
**[1:46:32-1:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:46:32):**  going to do with the tools i'm not insulting your granddad i'm insulting you if you don't if you  don't change it's on you it's not i'm not saying what your granddad did was wrong he did the best  he did the best with what he's been given but you've been given new tools new information  
**[1:46:46-1:47:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:46:46):**  if you continue on the path that you're going on that's on you that's not on anybody of your  granddad and at some point it's like i have to i have to balance the balance of i want people to  change and so i'm going to appeal to their pocketbook and i'm going to try to be as little  
**[1:47:03-1:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:47:03):**  like offend them as little as possible and and to paint in a picture to get as many people to do it  as possible the right way but at some point i'm gonna have to be able to tell them the truth about  what's happening to our top soils and it's going to offend people and i have to not care like i  
**[1:47:19-1:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:47:19):**  i want people to change and so it's like it's like some people i'm gonna piss off and maybe had i just  focused on the pocketbook thing i would have got them but at some point some people listen to it  unless they hear the other and it's just a balancing act and you have to be able to balance  
**[1:47:35-1:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:47:35):**  that but at the end of the day uh truth has to be told and i i can't care who hates me or who's  offended or who's not like people i need to hear the truth if the truth is offensive maybe the  problem is not with the truth so i man i haven't even let you talk at all about your cows  
**[1:47:56-1:48:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:47:56):**  so let's talk about let's talk about your cows in the context that your farm serves the cows and  your forage chain through the year and let's go yeah let's and let's close with that because i  gotta leave in about 10 minutes but um so you know the that i love that whole aspect of the journey  
**[1:48:20-1:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:48:20):**  because you know when i got started that's what i cared about is the cows and the cows  and i love efficient functional mama cows and you know so as as a red Angus breeder  i'm i'm trying to produce a cow that is going to produce a bull that is going to be something that  
**[1:48:40-1:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:48:40):**  they want to retain in their herd and so you know we focus really hard on on feet um you know i  from talking to other breeders i know that i probably do more diligence as far as calling  either the stud or the person that raised the bull asking for feet i know other people that do it  
**[1:49:01-1:49:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:49:01):**  i know that there's a lot of people who don't do it but you know it to me if you're going to be  breeding cattle then you better be asking for pictures of that that bull's dam and that bull's  dam and that bull's feet and that dam's feet if you want to know what you're getting and that  
**[1:49:18-1:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:49:18):**  helps me eliminate like a bunch of bulls that i'm going to pick because if they don't have good feet  and if they don't have good EPDs for feet if i'm looking to outcross to a black bull i won't even  pay attention to it because i'm i'm wanting to fix the breed i don't need to chase carcass and and  
**[1:49:37-1:49:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:49:37):**  all i love good marbling i love a good ribeye but i'm not going to chase that at the sake of a guy  buying a bull of mine and then he has to get rid of it in two years because it couldn't block  and it's like well it had a great ribeye and great marbling well that's fantastic he had to  
**[1:49:52-1:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:49:52):**  shoot it because he wouldn't you know wouldn't make it on his place so right um you know like  i i want functional cattle and so when it comes to functionality like that plays into everything  with the soil you know when we first started getting into doing this uh i remember having to  
**[1:50:08-1:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:50:08):**  one year one of those first years we doctored like 50 cows and 50 calves and i only had like 70  cow you know pairs we had to doctor 50 of them for foot rot and this year i think i had three out of  150 that we doctored for foot rot um and so you know being able to see that those numbers drop  
**[1:50:28-1:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:50:28):**  you know from being able to have them in our environment having them adapt to our environment  i love that aspect of it and you know i like the fact that we're actually seeing dung beetles  for the first time on our farm you know this year um you know i i didn't even wasn't even aware of  
**[1:50:46-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:50:46):**  a dung beetle why it was even important until i started doing the regenerative process and then  you know when i found out we needed to have dung beetles i started using  cydectin because i decked it doesn't kill uh dung beetles um and so this last year we saw  
**[1:51:02-1:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:51:02):**  a few and this year we saw about three times as many as we did last year um so it's like six which  not a lot but still it's you know it's exciting to see i i would i would challenge you to put  your cydectin away i i i'm like i would love to talk to you more about that plan a better plan  
**[1:51:22-1:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:51:22):**  for what's better even for okay so why would you if you have dung beetles in your soil why would  you why would you use cydectin why would you use that kind of insecticide so what's your what's  your target so cydectin i'm trying to kill lice um and cydectin doesn't affect the dung beetles  
**[1:51:40-1:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:51:40):**  and that's why why i've used cydectin instead of ivermectin why don't why don't you wait till  say june 15th next year to uh to work your cows for lice okay and then see what because when they  slick off in the summer the lice fall off you're saying it's not even an issue i'm saying it's not  
**[1:52:01-1:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:52:01):**  an issue like i it's hard to watch your cows get ate up by lice yeah it's it's hard but is it hard  on your cows yes but you know what as soon as summer comes in and they get their winter coat  coat off and get their summer coat on which they're gonna do faster if they're hormonally  
**[1:52:20-1:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:52:20):**  balanced and they're on a rising plane of nutrition on good forage they're gonna they're  gonna shed that winter coat and those lice aren't gonna have anywhere to live and they're just gonna  leave and that's what i do but you know i'm also that crazy idiot that runs horn cattle in the red  
**[1:52:36-1:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:52:36):**  hills yeah yeah and i think for for the bull selling bull purposes and stuff i would probably  still need it for my bulls as far as like uh eye appeal and um but on the cows i think that that  would be something i wouldn't mind trying just to see and see i don't mind i mean lice obviously  
**[1:52:56-1:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:52:56):**  that's something different but like if you're doing it for fly control i kind of don't mind  seeing you know a lot of flies on a bull because that's testosterone sure yeah but there's a point  where you know you you pass an echo you know where it becomes economic uneconomic to have your flies  
**[1:53:13-1:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:53:13):**  taking that much blood out of your cows yeah and i suppose that's something that everybody kind of  has to well i don't i mean my main focus is the lice like we we have to i mean that's a that's  another conversation too about like with your licked up and stuff like um i i i'd be interested  
**[1:53:29-1:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:53:29):**  in finding something that's more natural to take care of flies than say a poron because i i don't  think that the poron i don't think cydectin is an effective deterrent for flies i think rotating  your i think moving your cows every three four days tops is effective fly control yeah i i i  
**[1:53:49-1:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:53:49):**  really do i mean it as long as i move my cows once a week flies aren't a problem it's you don't want  to get to some of the bigger paddocks and i'm on low stock densities and you know they're going to  be in there for 10 12 14 days that's when we start to see fly pressure come back but then you know it  
**[1:54:03-1:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:54:03):**  takes another couple pasture rotations you're breaking that fly's life cycle by not letting that  by not letting that cow be exposed to the manure where the fly eggs are hatching you know by the  time that fly egg hatches out of the manure hopefully the cows are at least a half a mile  
**[1:54:17-1:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:54:17):**  or a couple paddocks away yeah you know they're still going to have some um i would i would say  okay so when i bought these cows in 20 um they did get they did get cydectin or a cydectin family  thing i can't remember what it was but that's what they got and we strip grazed at like 45 55  
**[1:54:41-1:55:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:54:41):**  000 pounds for 210 days on that hurt and flies never got bad last year no treatment no fly  treatment on them and there were less flies and this year there's even less and they weren't  treated this year either right you know i i i guess kind of what i'm saying is you know yeah  
**[1:55:02-1:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:55:02):**  there's there's a lot of insecticides out there and cydectin is supposed to be okay for dung  beetles and i get that um but i kind of kind of challenge why we need to use a lot of it honestly  and that's that's my take on it so you got a you if you have a few minutes left let's take us home  
**[1:55:22-1:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/85-Jay-Young-Must-Eliminate-Phos-e1p1281#t=1:55:22):**  yeah well it's like anything else try it and see if it if it was beneficial to go off or not  you know but yeah no brian i i love this conversation and uh yeah i uh appreciate you  having me on and um anytime you want to have me back i'd be willing to have fun to talk more

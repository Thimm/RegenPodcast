**[0:00:46-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:00:46):**  Well hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to a Friday bonus edition of Ranching Reboot.  This episode is sponsored by our generous patrons over on Patreon.com forward slash  Red Hills Rancher.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:00:56):**  Today we've got two time guest Hobbs Magaray joining us on Zoom.  And for this special bonus episode, since I'm kind of far ahead with the Monday releases,  Hobbs and I wanted to sit down here and kind of do a current event and catch up on some  
**[0:01:10-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:01:10):**  things that are on both of our minds that we've been thinking about a lot the last couple  of weeks.  And some things that have really kind of come up on social media in the last couple of weeks.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:01:20):**  Well, I guess really the last month.  So we kind of want to maybe talk about a few of those things that are going on in the world.  Like the first one that comes to mind is the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:01:33):**  Now we don't need to get into like a lot of the geopolitics or a lot of the economics  of natural gas.  I'm more concerned with talking about what kind of downstream effects that might have  
**[0:01:46-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:01:46):**  on our food system and how that could affect our businesses over the next year or so.  So that being said, we're kind of looking at some major, there could be some major issues  coming down the line.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:02:00):**  There will be.  Yeah, President Biden was just on, you know, he's been in the media the last couple of  days talking about there might be food shortages and anybody that pays attention when the government  
**[0:02:12-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:02:12):**  starts talking about food shortages, you know, it's going to be bad.  You need to sit up and pay attention and pay attention right now.  Because if the government is saying there could be food shortages this year, later this  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:02:26):**  year, they're not saying that right now for no reason.  They're saying that to try to prepare the population for incoming food shortages and  famine.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:02:34):**  Yeah, that's a, get it while the getting's good, right?  I mean, ultimately, the default position for governments when something bad is going to  happen coming down the pike is to ignore it and not say anything at all.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:02:52):**  But if certain things become so bad, and the forecast is so bad that they actually start  talking about it.  They know a certain percentage of people are not going to listen.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:03:05):**  But there is also a certain percentage of people that are.  And you know, so better get your toilet paper right now if you, or better yet, buy a bidet.  Yeah, I've had one of those for years.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:03:19):**  And you know, two years ago when everybody was panicking because I couldn't find toilet  paper.  Just like, I need like four squares a day guys.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:03:26):**  And I'm cool because I have this bidet thing on my toilet.  And you know, a lot of, I know probably a half a dozen people that have bought bidets  in the last two years because they didn't like not having toilet paper two years.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:03:39):**  Oh yeah, the Europeans are way ahead of us on a lot of things.  And the way that they use the restroom is definitely one of those.  So you know, here's to you Europe, once again more civilized than us.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:03:50):**  I think they're more civilized than us in a lot of ways, but maybe in some ways, some  of that civilization is going to come back to bite us in the butt.  Yeah, they're over civilized right now.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:04:01):**  It's definitely all of the massive resource rich countries to the east have been largely  subsidizing their high quality of life for a long time, based on the fact that the US  and Western Europe won World War Two.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:04:21):**  So we've been able to get really great deals on all their resources coming out of Eastern  Europe and you know, from basically for the last hundred years.  I mean, if you want to find the best vacuum tubes for a guitar amplifier, you look for  
**[0:04:41-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:04:41):**  German made tubes from the 40s and 50s made by surplus Nazi steel.  You know, that's by far the best stuff.  So you know, they have made a career out of taking those raw resources and making them  
**[0:05:02-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:05:02):**  better.  I think that you and I were just talking about with regard to Germany specifically.  Yeah, well, I guess we can kind of, you know, we just touch on it a little bit.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:05:13):**  So with the whole Russia Ukraine thing, one thing we got to understand is Ukraine is basically  Europe's breadbasket.  Like almost all their cereal crops that they consume are very, very large portion of cereal  
**[0:05:27-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:05:27):**  crops they consume in Europe are grown in the Ukraine.  And with ongoing conflict, those things aren't being planted right now.  Couple that with, you know, the political thing between Germany and Russia.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:05:42):**  Well, Russia supplies something like 40 almost 50% of Germany's natural gas.  And that natural gas isn't just used for electricity and power generation.  A lot of that natural gas goes to companies like BASF, Monsanto, and Sygenna, because  
**[0:05:58-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:05:58):**  they have chemical plants in Germany that use that natural gas as a feedstock.  So those plants don't have those feedstocks or can't get them.  They're just not available because Germany said, we're not buying Russian natural gas  
**[0:06:10-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:06:10):**  because we buy Russian natural gas, they have money, then it can keep fighting a war in  Ukraine.  So like, you got to really wonder what some of these world leaders are actually thinking  
**[0:06:21-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:06:21):**  at times.  But they've known that they've known for a long time that something was going to go down.  I mean, that's why it was always going to happen.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:06:33):**  It just so happens, in my opinion, that Russia just chose when to have, when to be the Black  Swan or whatever.  I mean, it's large, it's large 100 year long trends that are happening right now.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:06:46):**  And the only question mark was where was it going to be?  Or what was it going to be?  And it's always going to be something I mean, we are we are using and I don't want to be  
**[0:06:53-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:06:53):**  all doom and gloom here because I really think there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  But we are running into a shortage of a lot of different resources at the same time.  And never before in history has something like this happened.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:07:10):**  So you want this thing, you can't get it, oh, we'll turn to this thing.  Oh, we can't get that either, because there's such a shortage from it.  And as you were mentioning earlier, we're just sort of seeing the effects of the COVID  
**[0:07:21-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:07:21):**  supply chain.  And right now, we don't even know what we're in for.  And so we kind of have an idea what we're in for.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:07:30):**  But most of the as a civilization, we were just totally blinded.  And it's, it's extremely privileged, it's an extreme privilege to be kind of living  in a rural area with the ability to produce something of yourself by for yourself.  
**[0:07:48-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:07:48):**  And that's kind of our audience here, right?  So the so I think one of the things that that you and I wanted to talk about, and correct  me if I'm wrong was, you know, what they can do moving forward to secure themselves and  
**[0:08:01-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:08:01):**  put them in a position to help their community help their family come out on the other side  looking to in a position where they can be helpful as we begin to rebuild what's going  to happen.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:08:16):**  And that that brings up like just before we got on this on this call, I was on Twitter,  okay.  And the thread that I was on, somebody had asked, are the food, you know, President Biden  
**[0:08:31-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:08:31):**  said there's gonna be food shortage, are they going to be real?  And the response that you know, that I read to you that I'll share with the listeners  is basically the responder that I saw said, I work for a major food distributor, as bad  
**[0:08:45-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:08:45):**  as you think things are, nobody really knows how bad they are, much less how bad it's going  to get.  His advice was to stock up on uncanned and nonperishable goods.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:08:56):**  I'm gonna agree with that.  But I'm also going to say if that's your plan to stay alive, that's that's a very short  sighted plan, and food, your nonperishable stuff.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:09:09):**  You know, store not more than about a year, that's going to get really expensive really  fast.  And if, if you think that the current supply chain issues and possible food shortages are  
**[0:09:19-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:09:19):**  only going to last a year, I got news for you.  Like now is the time to plant a garden.  I mean, it is spring everywhere.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:09:28):**  You know, this episode is going to come out on Friday, whatever, April 8, plant your damn  garden.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:09:36):**  And buy seeds while you can because you know, certainly seeds, you throw them in the freezer,  you'll lose a little bit of germination rate, but you know, you can you can have some degree  of success moving forward.  
**[0:09:47-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:09:47):**  And anybody who's studied any degree of prepping, you know, whether a minor prepper or a major  prepper knows that if you become too insulated, and you have too many reserves, you become  a target for a very motivated population.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:10:04):**  So the most important thing that you can do is to really strengthen the ties in your community  in your your immediate area, because community is the thing that's going to get us through  this.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:10:14):**  You know, one person can only eat so much beef.  So if they're running a bunch of cows, you know, that gives you sort of an interesting  responsibility in the community.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:10:23):**  And, and, you know, it's, it, we don't, I don't know if we're completely talking about  the breakdown of industrial technological civilization, but we might, you know, a lot  of people have been planning for that for a long time.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:10:39):**  And any meaningful degree of that is going to create a lot of suffering for a lot of  people.  So certainly, plant a garden, I think that's exactly right.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:10:50):**  It's exactly what you should do.  Be meet your neighbors, if you haven't haven't already, be nice to them.  Create, create, really work hard, it's probably a little too late, but you know, work hard  
**[0:11:00-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:00):**  to create some great connections with you with your neighbors.  Stock up on the things that that allow you to do what it is that you do.  So for instance, what would that be for you, Brian?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:15):**  Well, I mean, that's going to be salt, that's going to be fence cable and fence posts, for  the most part, you know, just this, this maintenance, ongoing maintenance supplies that I know that  I'm going to need to operate my business.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:28):**  Some things that I can see that I've used several of in the last few years that might  be very difficult to get moving forward.  Something like a fiberglass repair kit.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:38):**  Interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  Like if I have to repair a fiberglass tank, so I'm going to write that down right now.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:46):**  Stock up on fiberglass repair supplies.  Concrete.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:11:51):**  You know, concrete, quickcrete might be a little bit difficult to get if you rely on  that, but you know, sometimes that's a crutch.  You know, sometimes it's just one of those nice to have things and we've, we've gotten  
**[0:12:01-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:01):**  used to used to being able to have that and use that.  Right.  And I was talking to a, I was talking to a friend this morning and I hope, hope he'll  
**[0:12:13-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:13):**  eventually listen to some, please, you know, I don't think he'll get upset about saying  this, but he was telling me, like he still has, he has some, he has some cows and a lot.  Don't judge too harshly, but he was telling me he was spending over $5,000 every two weeks  
**[0:12:29-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:29):**  on corn to feed those cows because corn was over eight bucks.  And I asked him, I said, you know what, what's your plan for that?  You know, and he's a sharp guy.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:38):**  He's been through ranching for profit.  So he has an idea what he's doing.  Right.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:45):**  And he told me that, you know, here he has a buyer for those that he's got, you know,  putting all the high cost corn in and he's going to be able to get out of them and make  money in another month.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:12:54):**  Great.  And then I asked him, so what are you going to do next year when it's 12 bucks and you  can only get half as much?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:01):**  And he said, gosh, I don't know.  It's going to be a scary time.  I said, well, you know, what happens when hay is, cause we were talking about hay too,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:10):**  and it was like, you know, 40 to $60 a bale for some of the hay that he's got, that he's  been rolling out to his cows that I'm watching.  And you know, what if that's 50% higher?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:20):**  Now you can't afford that.  You can't afford $120 a bale for a grass bale.  No, I know it's going to go through the roof, the fertilizer to grow the hay, the diesel  
**[0:13:32-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:32):**  to harvest the hay, the parts to fix on your tractor to get it.  It's just going to be unmanageable.  And I think really as ranchers, the thing that we, I mean, I catch so much flack on  
**[0:13:46-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:46):**  on social media for this, and I know you do too, but I think it is absolutely a hundred  percent correct what you've been saying.  And I've been thinking about this so much the last couple of weeks, because I think  
**[0:13:57-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:13:57):**  it is the perfect articulation of where we need to be headed as an industry.  And that is my cattle, please correct me if I'm wrong here, my cattle should survive on  grass and salt.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:14:14):**  And that's exactly right.  I mean, because a hundred percent of wild animals survive on that.  And obviously cattle come from that and we have the capacity to create that.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:14:30):**  And whether it's no longer a question of taste.  We don't create that.  We just peel back all the inputs and the ones that can't hack it in the natural environment  
**[0:14:43-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:14:43):**  without the inputs and we'll find the ones that can live on salt and scenery.  Yeah, absolutely.  And to some degree, I mean, yeah, I mean, some semantics, but I think that you're exactly  
**[0:14:53-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:14:53):**  right.  And it has now reached the point in the context of this conversation that it is no longer  a question of taste and preference.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:15:03):**  It is now a question of survival.  Is your herd going to survive if you cannot throw hay and protein at them?  Now, obviously, if you're in Montana, you're going to have to feed some degree of roughage  
**[0:15:16-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:15:16):**  through the winter when there's four feet of snow.  Like I'm not arguing with anybody about that.  And that's, you know, if hopefully you are making the most out of the shoulder seasons  
**[0:15:29-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:15:29):**  and not having to feed hay too early or feed it too long and you can maybe truncate the  amount of time you're feeding hay with a little bit of adapted grazing strategies.  I mean, because we're all going to have to do something.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:15:43):**  And then, you know, through the bulk of the year, pulling those inputs and seeing who's  going to work.  You know, another thing, another really controversial thing that I think is going to be really,  
**[0:15:54-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:15:54):**  really important moving forward is keeping your own bulls because you're going to find  who is working well on your property and your area.  And those are the bulls you want.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:16:04):**  That's the fastest way to get those genetics right.  A $10,000 bull from halfway across the country that you're only going to put with 25 cows.  That don't work.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:16:13):**  No, no, no, not at all.  And you know, I've not bought and sold a ton of bulls in my life, but the ratio is extremely  high to the homegrown bulls outperforming the papered registered bulls every time.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:16:31):**  It's been pretty interesting actually, just to see how easily the fed bulls have fallen  apart and the pedigree bulls have fallen apart and had problems and the homegrown bulls just,  man, they're just workhorses.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:16:49):**  So I mean, because ultimately all the homegrown bulls, you as a producer have to rely on your  eye and your instincts and their performance, whereas the pedigree bulls, you can just fall  back.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:16:59):**  So anyway, it's all about, for ranchers, it's all going to be about genetics and grazing  strategy moving forward, because if you think you're going to be able to continue doing  what you've been doing, if you're just right on that razor's edge of profitability and  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:17:12):**  able to continue doing it, you're not.  I mean, it's going to change.  Your fuel costs are going to go high.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:17:19):**  If you're feeding a ton of cake, a ton of protein tubs, a ton of hay, if you are feeding,  if you are supplementing, you are going to be in for a balance sheet wreck.  And we tell people this not because we want to judge or change or whatever, but because  
**[0:17:36-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:17:36):**  it's important that we continue to produce food for our communities and our nation.  And it's important for us to continue to preserve the ecology of the planet.  Breeding cattle that can survive on grass and salt is just as much an ecological necessity  
**[0:17:57-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:17:57):**  as it is a balance sheet necessity.  I agree 100%.  The high input cattle can only be supported by a lot of fossil fuel use, whether that's  
**[0:18:11-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:18:11):**  and you could just say a lot of energy use because they're kind of high energy cattle.  They require a high energy diet to stay in condition.  They require a high energy diet to maintain size.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:18:20):**  They require a high energy diet to maintain fertility and that high energy that comes  with a lot of grown feed.  You grow your own hay.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:18:32):**  Great.  There's a very high cost to growing that hay.  I mean, the machinery depreciate, the machinery costs, the depreciation costs, the guy that's  
**[0:18:41-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:18:41):**  got to sit in the seat to drive it and then your fuel costs and your fuel costs are kind  of like, you know, we had a nice in 2020.  I mean, and with low prices, diesel was about $2 and that wasn't, that was because of  
**[0:18:54-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:18:54):**  demand destruction brought about by everything being shut down in 2020.  So we saw the effects of the 2020 shutdown in 2021 at the pump.  We started to see it all through 2020.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:07):**  I mean, prices were falling, falling, falling.  When did they get low?  Like summer 21.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:11):**  Was that about it?  Yeah, it was nice to drive diesel pickup around at that point.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:16):**  So last year, you know, you had everybody doing their, you know, their spring, summer  and fall work in the fields without an input price spike with two, two and a half dollar  diesel this year.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:29):**  I mean, I saw it at 479 the other day and a couple of days later, it was back down to  473 for clear fuel.  I mean, obviously red fuel is going to be a little bit cheaper.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:41):**  So the point I'm making is if your fuel costs have already doubled just to drive your tractor,  your fuel costs have doubled.  The rest of your costs are going to follow shortly.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:19:53):**  You might not see it this year on this year's buy, but you will see it next year.  Yeah.  And in order to intercept that in your strategy, you have to make changes now.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:20:08):**  Right now you have to use, I mean, this might be our last, if you're a producer on the edge,  this might be your last chance to make some changes before you get absolutely toppled  next year.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:20:20):**  Right, exactly.  That's exactly right.  This is the hardest thing to do when it comes to changing your grazing management practices  
**[0:20:28-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:20:28):**  is to make the investment in a lot of cases to do that, whether it's running water infrastructure  or building fence, whether it's permanent or temporary or, you know, training yourself  or, you know, forcing, you know, losing a percentage of your calf crop because you pull back the  
**[0:20:48-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:20:48):**  inputs and then can't prop up that fertility anymore.  I mean, it's like, it's going to take some bravery right now to do what is necessary  to be ahead of the game next year, because it's going to look like a loss this year,  
**[0:21:04-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:21:04):**  but a small loss this year could prevent you from having a big wreck next year.  Yes, yes.  Being proactive.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:21:12):**  I was just sitting here thinking while you're talking about, you know, some of our most  vocal critics, yours and mine both, that we've run across in the last two years that are  in our industry.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:21:26):**  It's going to be fun to watch them on social media over the next 12 months to see what  happens to their operations.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:21:32):**  Yeah, I mean, I tend to see that the vocal critics don't really post a whole lot in my  case, but I really, I feel I have a lot of compassion for those folks, man.  I mean, it's, the people who are mean are that way because they're scared and they don't  
**[0:21:51-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:21:51):**  they don't really necessarily know it, but they're terrified that the mythology that  they have built their life on is not the best way to do it and that it's going to come crumbling  down.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:22:02):**  And the only way that they can express that or deal with it is to lash out in anger.  And to and I think that and so I mean, if I could have, you know, one wish for those  folks, it would be that my goodness, I hope that I hope you're okay.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:22:16):**  And I hope that you know, the the dominoes fall so that you're able to continue this  wonderful practice of animal husbandry and stewardship of the land because, you know,  I have zero schadenfreude for people failing.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:22:36):**  I want to see everybody succeed.  I want to see I want to see my vocal critic, my most vocal, hateful critics.  I want to see those people have good, happy lives.  
**[0:22:47-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:22:47):**  And ultimately, at the end of the day, that is that would be my deepest wish.  That being said, some of them are going to crash and burn.  A lot of people are so rooted in their ways.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:00):**  And so, you know, the brain is very plastic if you allow it to be, but it can also be  very rigid.  And a lot of people are really, really right.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:09):**  The only compaction, only compaction problem is compaction of the mind.  That's one of those things that you say.  I stole that from Ray Archuleta.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:17):**  That's not mine.  That's a Ray Archuleta thing.  You don't know Uncle Ray, do you?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:22):**  That's awesome.  I do know him, actually.  I set on I tried to get the City of Sisters to hire in Sisters Oregon to hire him as a  
**[0:23:35-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:35):**  consultant on what they should do for their effluent pastures.  And so we set like a two hour meeting and, you know, I had an initial conversation with  him.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:48):**  It was like an hour and then two hour meeting with the City of Sisters.  And he was like, you know, he was great.  I really, really enjoyed him.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:23:56):**  And so that's exactly right.  The only compaction problem is compaction of the mind.  And if people can have I mean, it would certainly be very presumptuous of me to think that I  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:24:08):**  know so much that I would wish they would have an enlightening moment that would let  them see my way.  But I don't have that.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:24:16):**  What I have is I hope that things work out where they're okay, you know, and that they  don't have to suffer too much.  I can agree with that.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:24:26):**  So but ready to end this thing on a high note?  Yeah, I think I don't know what high note there is right now in the world.  You know, it's I think there I think there's absolutely a high note and the high note is  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:24:36):**  this.  So much of the lack of meaning and purpose in this life is because people don't have  any problems to contend with.  
**[0:24:44-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:24:44):**  You know, the what what what we're talking about right now is the lifeblood of the industrial  technological civilization that owns all of us and controls all of us, the civilization  that makes everything that is in its benefit easy, and everything that is not in its benefit  
**[0:25:01-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:25:01):**  illegal, you know, so everything that human beings want to do is either easy because it  benefits the system or illegal because it doesn't benefit the system.  And so it boxes us down into smaller and smaller boxes of control that support the technological  
**[0:25:14-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:25:14):**  civilization that is about to be on life support.  So there's this mat in this suffering, there's about to be this massive box unboxing of freedom,  where people are going to have the capacity to have more control over their own lives,  
**[0:25:28-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:25:28):**  that will come with more risk that will come with more capacity to suffer.  But that is kind of the trade off that has has to happen.  And if we can contend with that challenge forthrightly, and stand up and say we're going  
**[0:25:41-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:25:41):**  to get through this and make it better instead of whining and sniveling that now I can't  drive my car as much as I used to and just say, hey, we're going to have to do things  differently.  
**[0:25:50-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:25:50):**  And we're going to have to do it better, then we are going to come out on the other side  of this a better civilization, we're going to come out on the other side of this, a better  society.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:00):**  Now that is not to say that people won't starve, that people won't die.  But the history of humanity is rife with ups and downs and tragedy and, and triumph.  And ultimately, at the end of every tragedy is a triumph.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:14):**  And hopefully, the triumph that we're able to create out of this is going to be long  lasting and create a lot of beautiful life for as many life forms, including humans as  possible.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:27):**  I think that's the I think that's the light at the end of the tunnel.  I guess we could say that we are, our society is maybe a little pregnant, and it's about  ready to give birth to something new.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:40):**  Because exactly right.  And every birth, there's pain, they're screaming.  And there's usually a little bit of blood.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:48):**  And I don't think that this rebirth is going to be any different.  Right and and and shit too.  There's definitely a lot of that.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  I guess the message is this.  Watch your costs.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:04):**  Think about making some changes.  No, don't just think about making some changes.  Plan to make some changes now.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:09):**  You'll be you'll have to you'll be forced to if you don't do it voluntarily.  And the ones that do it voluntarily early are going to feel much, much less pain than  the ones that get the ones that have to change by force down the road.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:23):**  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, wonderful.  I could not be more excited to be alive at this point in time and ranching.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:32):**  It's going to be hard, but I think it's going to be great in the end.  I've been saying it for a couple of months, like we are just in an absolutely fascinating  time in history.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:42):**  Like we have we know all of these events that are going on the world around us, and we're  connected to all of them through our smartphone.  And we've never been more connected.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:27:55):**  But at the same time, we've never been more disconnected from each other and more disconnected  from our food supply and from the land.  And I can only hope that through the course of this, what will likely be a very painful  
**[0:28:12-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:28:12):**  rebirth of our civilization on our society, that we can learn some of these lessons about  connecting to other humans and making smaller communities that we can take care of better  that we better understand the needs of rather than just saying, well, that's too hard.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:28:30):**  We'll just let one guy run everything.  No.  I mean, we have to have small communities.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:28:36):**  We have to be able to support our small communities.  And I think that that's the direction that those of us that are going to survive this.  That's where we're going to be.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:28:44):**  We're going to be in a smaller community.  We're going to be have good strong ties with our neighbors.  We're going to cooperate on things like growing food and sharing meals and harvesting the  
**[0:28:56-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:28:56):**  crops and sharing in the fruits of the land like the cows you see behind me.  I'm never going to eat all my cows.  Like there's way too many cows for me and my family to eat.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:06):**  I just want to feed my family and take care of my community.  And that's it.  And part of that is I've never bought into the whole feed the world bullshit.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:16):**  Because by the time I started hearing that, you start looking around like the people that  are saying that what are they growing?  They're growing corn and soybeans and cotton.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:26):**  Like, okay, feed the world.  Yeah, we're feeding the world full of corn and soybeans and cotton.  I get people need clothes and I get corn does other things than just feed cows and make  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:39):**  biofuel.  Well, the world is more than just people.  The world is I mean, we're not feeding the world.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:44):**  We're eating the world.  We're consuming the world in order to feed people.  And there's a way that we can feed the world and also feed people out of it.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:29:52):**  And you know, that's the area that gets a lot of people that are just like, no, we just  have to absolutely be the microbe that eats the apple in its completeness in order to  survive.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:03):**  And we are we are absolutely killing the goose that lay the golden egg by doing this.  But there is there is a huge opportunity to if we reverse course, I mean, it's going to  be it's going to be fantastic.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:16):**  I mean, if we can if we can make those changes.  And another thing that I wanted to mention is that there will also be fortunes made through  this process and love.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:28):**  Yeah, absolutely.  We I mean, it's obvious that people are going to lose money.  And we spent a lot of this time talking about how people can avoid losing money.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:35):**  But the people who do crazy, insane things right now that end up catching are the ones  who are going to make fortunes in the in the long run.  The world's not going to end and the economy is not going to end.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:46):**  And it but you know, it's at least not with a bang.  Right, right, right, right.  And it's it's times like this that that opened the greatest amount of opportunity, those  
**[0:30:56-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:30:56):**  periods of instability.  So if you have your mind tuned towards opportunity and, and are brave enough to take some risks  and make some changes that you may not have been, you may not have entertained previously.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:31:11):**  I think that, you know, this, this is the most exciting time, as you as you mentioned  earlier, I think this is one of the most exciting times to be alive.  And, you know, if you were if you were a betting person and wanted to become fabulously have  
**[0:31:23-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:31:23):**  the opportunity to become fabulously wealthy, or fabulously successful or fabulously contributive,  this is exactly the environment that you would be looking for.  I like it.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:31:37):**  I like it.  Well, Hobbs, I really appreciate you joining me for this little special bonus.  Brian, it's, it's always it's always a huge pleasure, my friend.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:31:47):**  Hopefully we haven't scared the pants off everybody and given given some folks some  hope and a few things to think about today.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:31:54):**  It's gonna be great.  It's gonna be hard, but it's gonna be great.  Where there's a where there's I'm thinking of the SWT analysis, right?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:32:06):**  Like, wherever you see a weakness, take that weakness turned into a strength wherever you  see a threat, take that turn that into an opportunity.  So if you're seeing threats coming down the road at you in the next 12 months, you have  
**[0:32:18-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:32:18):**  time take that threat and turn it an opportunity for your business.  That's right.  That's right example.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:32:26):**  Yeah, I mean, just it is the obvious example to that, like, you know, the threat is, I'm  not going to have feed to feed my cattle anymore.  So you turn that threat into an opportunity by going, Alright, well, I'm going to start  
**[0:32:40-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:32:40):**  breeding cattle that don't need it.  I'm glad I started two years ago.  The fortunes will be made Brian.  
**[0:32:51-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-9-with-Hobbs-Magaret-e1gpgcq#t=0:32:51):**  Oh, it's, it's just the pain of getting there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Alright, you guys have a great weekend and we'll see you back on Monday for another

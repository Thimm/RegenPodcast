**[0:00:54-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:00:54):**  One of them could be you next week.  Today we've got a special treat for you.  Previous two time guests, my good friend Matt Cleffer joins us from Southeast Kansas to  
**[0:01:05-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:01:05):**  talk about some of the things kind of going on in the world and some, well, maybe not  so many things going on in the world.  We've covered that in other podcasts lately, but what we want to do today is not throw  
**[0:01:19-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:01:19):**  out so much doom and gloom.  Let's throw out some hope.  Let's talk about what people should be doing or could be doing now as this episode comes  
**[0:01:30-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:01:30):**  out to plant a garden, to start planning for the future.  So I guess before we get into that, can we have a Harmony Hill farmstead update, sir?  Yeah, man.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:01:47):**  Well, we're trucking right along.  We're kind of changing some gears up right now.  And I'm really taking this season away from the production side of things because of the  
**[0:01:57-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:01:57):**  shape the world is in.  And we are really pouring all of our resources into education, helping people learn and understand  how to be resilient and how to prepare themselves for what is coming.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:10):**  So we have April 30th, we have a garden class coming up.  The class is free.  I want you to come.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:17):**  Don't let money be the barrier.  I do have lunch provided.  We're going to have some Harmony Hill, some of our pastured pork bratwurst with some of  
**[0:02:26-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:26):**  our own homemade fermented sauerkraut lunch will be 12 bucks.  Come enjoy the day.  I have Robert Eskew coming from Rose Creek Farm in Selmer, Tennessee.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:36):**  A little bit about them.  They garden, they market garden on three quarters of an acre and clear $750,000 in gross sales  per year.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:47):**  It's a highly and say that again, three quarters of an acre.  Okay.  No tractors.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:02:55):**  There's the owner and the two or three hired hands, $750,000 in gross sales.  Highly diversified.  Yeah, it's incredible.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:07):**  I got to go tour the place.  Robert is a good friend of mine.  I helped him kind of get some stuff on his homestead going.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:13):**  I drove all the way up there and helped him butcher pigs.  And he's going to be coming down here.  We're swapping expertise.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:19):**  He's coming down here to teach us how to grow a lot of food in a short space.  We're going to be having some butcher classes.  I built this garage.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:29):**  I've got it set up to basically how to have your home, be able to have a butcher shop  in your home and not break the bank and buy a lot of equipment.  How to do it on the cheap and make it super effective.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:43):**  So we're going to be tuning into our Facebook page and we're going to figure out a way to  get people's email addresses because I know Facebook, my days on Facebook are numbered  and I don't trust that platform.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:03:55):**  So we're going to try to get ahold of people's email addresses so that we can contact you  and let you know when these classes are happening so that we can help out as many people as  possible.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:04):**  So, and not so much depend on Facebook to get the word out.  Right.  Yep.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:10):**  I have a little problem with your upcoming prepare conference.  I can't make it.  Well, I have a good reason.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:19):**  The open range 200K is that weekend.  That's a bicycle race that comes across the ranch.  So I'm going to have, oh gosh, I think Eric said he had over like 500 people registered.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:33):**  Yeah.  500 nut cases are going to go ride 128 miles through the red Hills and sandy dirt roads  and across some of my pastures and a couple other people's pastures.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:44):**  So that's going to be going on on the 30th.  So I kind of need to stick around for that and make sure that none of the cyclists die  or get tangled up in the hot wire, get their bike twisted up in the barbed wire or anything  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:04:59):**  bad.  So not that that's happening.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:02):**  There will be more, trust me.  We got a long ways to go in this and yeah, there'll be more.  But you're helping the cause just the same.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:11):**  So do what you need to do.  So I like doing that open range because it gives me a chance to share my land and the  beauty and the views.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:22):**  With a couple of hundred people that are very health conscious that want to come out and  do these bicycle rides specific because A, they're hard and B, because it's stuff that  they never get to see otherwise.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:36):**  That's cool.  So minister to that crowd, man.  I'll do my best.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:43):**  And I've always had it in the back of my head that someday I'll be able to sell that group  beef that I raise off the ranch that they've been able to ride by.  So yeah, that day's coming, man.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:05:55):**  I've had that one in my head for a while.  We've been working that angle.  So building our soil health and community food culture.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:06:08):**  That's the way forward, right?  Yeah, essentially metaphorically.  Like I always think of like, this is the time we're preparing to build the arc.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:06:21):**  We're building the arc right now.  And you always got to wonder like when that was going on, God gave Noah the image something's  going to happen.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:06:31):**  And he had to do that unfaith of like, he didn't see the bad stuff happening.  He knew in his mind that something was going to crazy.  And he had the faith to be able to build that arc.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:06:41):**  And everybody else was looking at him and laughing at what he was doing to try and prepare  for this event.  And that's where we're at right now.  
**[0:06:49-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:06:49):**  And we're not going to talk doom and gloom today.  But for those people that are awake and do see what's coming, and you're in preparation  for your arc, now is not the time to lose steam.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:00):**  Now is not the time to question.  This is like when you're in the outfield and you're watching the pitcher and the batter  at the plate.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:08):**  I think I use this analogy in our last podcast, but you can tell where that ball is going  to go before that batter ever swings the bat.  And you need to start shifting your feet and running to intercept.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:18):**  Because if you're one step behind, that's going to cost us the game where we're at.  I mean, literally things are progressing so fast every day.  I'm not a baseball guy, but I can understand the analogy.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:31):**  Yeah.  And so before we get into the what and the how, for me, the why is the most important.  The why is what is going to sustain you when everybody else is pointing and laughing at  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:45):**  like, there's nothing going wrong.  Why are you doing all that gardening in your front yard?  And why are you trying to learn how to butcher a pig?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:07:54):**  Why don't you come out to the country club with us and relax?  I have this nice steak that the cook made that nobody knows where it came from.  And these vegetables that came from halfway around the world sprayed with God only knows  
**[0:08:08-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:08:08):**  what.  So the why you need to write your why down and probably tape it to your bathroom here.  All of us do.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:08:17):**  You do, I do, everybody that's listening to this and put your why down.  And your why might be because I want to make sure that my family gets through this to the  other side intact and that my legacy is sought out through my relatives and my tribe and  
**[0:08:34-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:08:34):**  my community, whatever it may be.  But I'm telling you, we have not seen anything like what's coming in the likes of multiple  generations.  
**[0:08:47-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:08:47):**  And the way forward is learning to how learning how to do more with less because there is  not going to be any do how to do more with more.  How to get more corn with more fertilizer.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:09:01):**  How to get a bigger cow with more feed.  It's how do you get more with less feed with less fertilizer with less inputs and allow  biology to run its course.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:09:16):**  We're not talking about chemistry today.  We're not talking about how to manipulate it to make it go bigger faster.  The way to go forward is to understand that biology takes time and that it's a cycle and  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:09:27):**  you have to trust it the way it was created.  It works.  It's not broken.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:09:33):**  And when you trust it and we don't we as humans get out of the way and have some patience,  it will take care of us.  I mean the system of economics, if you if you take a pepper and you pick it off the  
**[0:09:46-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:09:46):**  plant and you go in your house and you open up the pepper inside that pepper are hundreds  of seeds off that one pepper has the ability to reproduce hundreds of times over and again.  That one pepper can make enough food and another two seasons to feed a neighborhood block just  
**[0:10:04-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:10:04):**  from one piece of produce.  And the ability when we have that understanding, it's like, oh my gosh, nature wants to provide  so much for us.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:10:16):**  Why are we getting in the way?  Why are we using seeds that cannot reproduce?  Somebody told us they were a good thing.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:10:25):**  That's right.  And we'll leave that conversation for a different day.  But the the biological bank account that is going to get us through this human human designed  
**[0:10:39-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:10:39):**  depression is our soil, as you said.  And for us to be resilient on the day when you can't run by the hardware store and pick  up that fertilizer to grow a garden, you need to have a system in place for how to make  
**[0:10:52-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:10:52):**  this easy, not labor intensive and incredibly resilient to our very, very, very unpredictable  weather patterns we've been having.  We could see a drought this year.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:11:06):**  We could see insanely where some weather forecasters are talking like La Nina is not done and that  cycle is going to blow through here again.  And we could see an insanely wet spring summer.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:11:21):**  It could be like 1816 when Thomas Jefferson wrote it was the year without a summer when  Mount Tambora erupted.  We have insanely high volcanic activity right now.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:11:33):**  It's just very volatile and we don't know what the future holds.  And when that comes, we can't rely on products.  That's not going to be there to bail us out.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:11:43):**  We can't rely on silver bullets.  We have to rely on a system that can prove the test of time.  And that system is humans survived thousands of years growing their own food up until now.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:11:59):**  And there's only a few of us left that understand how to do it.  The rest of us are completely freaking clueless.  I mean, clueless.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:12:09):**  And if you're one of those people, I would just encourage you to stop what you're doing  right now and literally change your priorities to the fact of, I need to know how to do this  before I worry about my new membership at the country club or whatever you're saving  
**[0:12:27-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:12:27):**  up to buy a new pair of Jordans.  Not important, not important.  We're literally down to talking about survival.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:12:38):**  It's no longer about the fluff.  Sell that stuff now.  It's going to be worthless in a few months.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:12:48):**  Nobody cares about your golf clubs.  Nobody's going to be golfing.  Everybody's going to literally be trying to survive.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:12:55):**  That's how fast.  Ask yourself this, when Rome fell, all of these Eastern European societies, when they  went down the trash, how fast did it happen?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:07):**  Did the society see it coming?  No, they never do.  Never, never.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:13):**  It doesn't work like that.  People just, the human species goes a hundred miles an hour until they literally walk off  the edge of the cliff.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:20):**  And then they look back up and go, what happened?  Somebody throw me a rope.  It's crazy.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:28):**  So yeah, let's, where, where are the majority of your listeners from Brian?  Are they suburbanites?  Are they urbanites?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:37):**  Are they who, who listens to this show?  Who are we talking to?  You know, I, I honestly, I really don't have that kind of granular demographic data.  
**[0:13:49-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:13:49):**  It's broken down by, you know, by country, by city or by country, state, city, in a lot  of cases or like, you know, some of the listeners in Europe, I've got listeners in Europe, few  in South America, some in Australia, some in Asia.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:14:03):**  Like I pretty well represent, I'm not going to say like, you know, a hundred people in,  you know, in Africa listen, there's maybe like two, three, five, whatever.  I really don't know.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:14:16):**  I've got the majority of your listeners, miss Midwestern ranchers.  My number one city and state is Houston, Texas.  So yeah, I, I honestly don't know.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:14:28):**  I'd like to hope that at least half the people listening, you know, I, I I'd like to imagine  that say we've got a 50 50 blend of people already with boots on the ground, doing stuff,  you know, looking for better ways, looking for more information.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:14:45):**  And I'd hope that we got to the other half that is in the filing cabinet in the city  or in the suburbs.  That's you know, working a nine to five for somebody else that's interested in regenerative  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:14:59):**  ag and soil health.  I'd like to think that we've got at least a few people out there that, you know, are  in that, in that Democrats that we can talk to.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:07):**  Sure.  Well, I mean, I, I know there's even some, some big time production commodity crop farmers  that listen, um, maybe not anymore, maybe not anymore.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:19):**  Maybe I've run them off, but I did, I did have some guys that, you know, were, were  into tillage and chemical use and things like that, that they're listening.  I wish I go ahead.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:30):**  I was going to say, here's the scariest part of kind of where we're at is even the people  that consider themselves farmers, raising things like that still don't raise food that  they can readily eat.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:41):**  It's like, if you're a commodity crop farmer, well, you might be raising thousands of acres  of food, but you're still not raising food.  Like something's got to happen to that stuff before a human can consume it.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:52):**  Well, so it's, I mean, commodity crops.  So we've got corn, soybeans.  Those are the biggest two.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:15:59):**  We can talk about a little bit, but corn and soybeans aren't food.  No.  I mean, none of the, almost none of the soybeans that are grown around here are eaten for food.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:16:10):**  Like I think that it's, it's a very small percentage of the U S soybean acres that actually  go towards human consumption.  And it's the, it's the same thing with corn, like, you know, yeah, there's millions of  
**[0:16:20-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:16:20):**  acres of corn, 40% goes to ethanol, 40% goes to cow feed, 18% goes to other uses.  And 2% is actually for human consumption.  Like all the acres of corn planted, like two, maybe 3% are for direct human consumption.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:16:38):**  The rest ethanol, which, Oh, well that's, that's when we can use that for ethanol, then  we can feed that to cows or, you know, directly to cow feed.  It's, it's really interesting to talk about feeding the world because we can't even feed  
**[0:16:57-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:16:57):**  our communities.  I mean, it's a little better in Eastern Kansas, but the farther West you go through Kansas,  and I'm sure it's like this in most other States that kind of straddle that hundred  
**[0:17:07-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:17:07):**  parallel, you get East of that and things are, things are a little bit better.  You know, land bases are a little bit smaller farms are a little bit closer together and  there's more people doing what you're doing, but you get out West.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:17:19):**  West where I'm at, you know, you need a much larger land base to make things work.  And the get big, get out mentality, I think drove a lot of that, you know, okay, well  I've got 5,000 acres to do now.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:17:33):**  Cause I had to buy out my neighbor or somebody else was going to get it.  Well, instead of doing these other crops, we're just going to, you know, we're not going  to do this other thing so we can do more of this.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:17:43):**  I understand why everybody got big, but I think the time to get small it's now.  Oh baby.  I tell you what I mean, what's encouraging me right now is we've got several farmers  
**[0:17:58-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:17:58):**  around here that are on that.  You know, their crops is on the hot wire and they're straddling both sides.  Man, do we, do we try to acquire more land or we do we downsize?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:18:07):**  And there's a lot of farmers around here downsizing that are outsourcing some of their land to  guys, my age with families that are wanting to have a space to raise pastured pigs or  get some of their own cows.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:18:22):**  And they're there instead of continuously hang some old hay meadows guys are taking  them off and hot wiring a few cows through there so they can have those for butcher animals.  I mean, people are really starting to wake up around here and I'm encouraged.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:18:36):**  I really am because even the big time, well, there's a couple big time commodity crop farmers  that are just continuing on in their own direction because that's the only way they can survive  is if they, I mean, they're just so they're so big.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:18:51):**  They can't, the only way they're going to fail is if they stop getting bigger.  Literally that's that's the track you're on.  And if you're still at that place where you can be resilient by downsizing, every one  
**[0:19:02-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:02):**  of them is doing it.  Every one of them is getting, they're selling the sprayers and we're getting back out that  cultivator and they're getting back down to an acreage size that's manageable without  
**[0:19:11-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:11):**  the 600 course tractors like we were talking about earlier.  And they're getting back to a place where they don't feel controlled to have to sell  off their commodity stuff at the elevator where they can go, okay, well, we can, we've  
**[0:19:25-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:25):**  got a maneuverable way that we can use this to feed out some feeder animals.  We can get this into some hogs and guys that they're going, going back out into them old  chicken houses in the mill hog barns and dusting off the boards and flipping the lights back  
**[0:19:39-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:39):**  on and filling up the ferrin crates and trying to get some stuff happening again.  That's what's got me encouraged is these old diversified farmsteads that really died down  in the 70s and 80s.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:51):**  There's still a few guys left.  I'm one of them.  I remember what that was like waking up in the morning, drinking the Dr. Pepper with  
**[0:19:57-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:19:57):**  my grandfather, going down, collecting eggs, going down and feeding the baby piglets, getting  out and heading to the cow calf in the pasture, a diversified farm, going and picking pears  and fruit out of the orchard with my grandma.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:20:11):**  I remember doing all that as a kid.  And that today I believe is what I'm going to pass on as my legacy into this generation  of what is to come, because I'll give you a little, a little cool bit of history.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:20:27):**  When my ancestors came over here from Germany, my great great grandfather was an orchardist.  And when he started the Clep for Homestead, he planted hundreds and hundreds of apple  trees and apricots and pears.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:20:41):**  And there's still an old apricot tree by grandma's house was one that he planted and it bloomed  last year and it put off fruit.  We're talking way over a hundred years old, way, way over a hundred years old.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:20:54):**  You said, do you know seeds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:21:00):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how that's as we speak, those, those seeds are, are stratifying.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:21:05):**  Cause I believe I never met the man.  I never met my great great grandfather, but I believe he is, he is going to pass something  on to me this year that he saw unimaginable things in his lifetime.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:21:22):**  But I feel the quickening in my feet, the shifting in the ground, the uneasiness in  the air, probably the same that he did hundreds of years ago, a couple of hundred years ago,  when everything was falling to pot and they em, they immigrated to America and things  
**[0:21:39-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:21:39):**  were going crazy.  So anyway, I know that I can be resilient.  I trust my, my ancestral wisdom that's inside of me, you know?  
**[0:21:50-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:21:50):**  So there's a lot of that ancestral wisdom that we've lost over the generations because  get big or get out.  Nobody wanted to maintain that farm, maintain that history.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:22:03):**  The neighbor bought it and history gets lost, knowledge gets lost.  And that the journey is trying to reclaim that lost knowledge of how to work with less,  how to make more with less in this environment.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:22:24):**  One of the really cool things to think about, well, it's not really cool.  It's actually kind of scary at first is when you go down this journey of trying to reclaim  that ancestral wisdom, there's a very high learning curve and a high amount of failure  
**[0:22:38-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:22:38):**  that needs to happen so that you can have the understanding.  And really what you're doing is reacquainting yourself with your senses.  You know, you put your iPhone in your pocket and you're not allowed to get out that app  
**[0:22:50-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:22:50):**  to tell you what tree you're looking at or that botany book to tell you what plant species  you're looking at.  And you're reclaiming your senses, your eyes of how you're looking at the distribution  
**[0:23:01-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:01):**  of diversity of plants under your feet and you're understanding the forage that's around  you, the heights of the trees and the different canopies, the color of the soil, the smell  of the soil.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:11):**  All of these are senses that used to be wisdom to any human that walked out on the range  that could go, these are the species.  This is what I need to survive.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:20):**  And they literally didn't have to look up anything.  They just knew it.  And, you know, we're at a point today where there isn't that time to fail to reacquaint  
**[0:23:32-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:32):**  oneself with their senses and their surroundings.  Like that's why the sense of urgency for you and I is so high right now is because guys,  we don't have time to go out there and mess up.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:45):**  Like when it gets go time, we're talking in a few months.  Most people don't even have their homesteads or farmsteads.  Like for me, I planned out over a year ago, I already have all of this season's grain  
**[0:23:58-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:23:58):**  bought to finish out all of my feeder pigs.  And I have records going with a couple area, local area farmers to buy right off the field  all the grain I need to get next year sows taken care of.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:24:12):**  And enough grass worked out with neighbors.  I'm not, I don't have any grain for my cows, but, and I'm not really worried about chicken  at this point.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:24:25):**  But I'm planning this stuff two years out.  Fuel wise, I know how much fuel I need to grind enough feed for my pigs to get through  a whole year.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:24:35):**  And I'm, I'm ready.  I was ready months ago.  But  
**[0:24:41-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:24:41):**  You've also seen the handwriting on the wall.  I feel like I got this vision kind of like Noah building the ark.  Noah was given the ark or the division seven years before the flood, seven years to prepare.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:24:53):**  That was how long he had.  And that was when I quit teaching.  I walked into my superintendent's job and I had, I knew something was going to happen.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:01):**  And here we are.  That was way over five years ago.  That's the, we just, I just found the title of the episode.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:09):**  Building the ark.  Building the ark, baby.  I'm telling you.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:15):**  I've made videos about like that.  There's a lot of people that are starting to get switched on of like, maybe this crazy  guy is right.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:23):**  Cause at first it was like, people point and laugh at me.  And then they try to riddle kill you.  And then they're like, Oh man, I was just really hoping you were wrong, but you're not  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:34):**  wrong.  Well, it's okay.  Do you ever hate being right?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:40):**  I do hate being right.  But I, I do wish I was wrong.  I too wish I could just continue with my comfortable government job and teaching school and drawing  
**[0:25:50-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:50):**  a little paycheck and coming home and living comfortably, but we're not there.  Sorry.  It's it's go time.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:25:59):**  And the day, the days I think of easy comfort are drawing to an end.  And let's not go down the doom and gloom rabbit trail.  We kind of agreed not to do that.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:26:12):**  That's why I spent a few minutes before we touch the button to talk.  So let's talk about community food tribes.  How do we, how do we reach those people that are living?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:26:27):**  I don't know.  Let's just say like in Derby or Lenexa or, you know, somewhere where they've got a house  and a yard or maybe even an apartment building and you know, a sunny South facing window.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:26:42):**  So let's, let's start talking about some strategies that everybody could do then maybe get into  some more focused stuff.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:26:51):**  The biggest thing is, is number one, building relationships, I think, because if you're  in that environment, you are not in a place where you can get yourself through a highly  tumultuous age that is going to last multiple years, unless you have a relationship with  
**[0:27:07-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:27:07):**  someone that can furnish you protein.  And protein is the, is basically the ticket through a famine.  I mean, if you don't have protein, your immune system gets bogged down.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:27:20):**  You get sick.  The healthcare industry is extremely taxed and stressed from every, you know, every direction.  And if your body does not have adequate protein, you're not going to make it.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:27:33):**  So building a relationship with a farmer, a rancher, somebody that does have access  to any kind of livestock whatsoever, please don't be picky.  Please don't come and whine about you.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:27:45):**  Like you've got an old bowl and all you could do is make hamburger out of it.  I mean, then do it.  That's 500 pounds of hamburger, which feeds a lot of people for a long time.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah.  Like at this point, complaining about, oh, it tastes gamey.  Well, that's, you can taste dead then, you know, like your taste buds don't work when  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:06):**  you're dead.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:10):**  So building those relationships with the right people for your suburbanites is number one  key ensuring food insurance.  If you're not in a place to get protein, fine.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:22):**  Now, as far as your little home or your little backyard, what I'm going to do instead of  giving you the information is I'm going to name drop for a second and give you names  of people that you can get online, watch their systems and see which one fits you, fits your  
**[0:28:37-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:37):**  personality, your surroundings, which one you like the best, because there are way better  people out there than that than me.  My specialty is building relationships and networking.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:47):**  That's what I do best.  So if you, if you want to jot down these names, there's a couple guys up in Canada as far  as market gardening go.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:28:56):**  The number one is Curtis Stone and he has a platform called from the field.tv and he  has thousands and thousands of videos about how to grow a lot of food in a very small  space.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:29:11):**  The second one from Canada is J M Fortier.  He and Curtis are neck and neck in terms of insanely innovative content.  And their systems are very similar.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:29:30):**  They both use kind of a mainstream 30 inch wide bed and the length of it, I believe is  either 50 or 100 foot.  They use similar tools to go about growing the food.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:29:41):**  I would say Curtis's platform with from the field.tv is a little bit easier to access.  For the people that are in the northern United States, there's a guy up in Maine who has  designed a mobile greenhouse system and does year around vegetable gardening in Maine.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:29:59):**  And really, I believe his one of his books is called the year around garden.  His name is Elliot Coleman.  He has some really cool, I think he has four books that are just really, really good.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:30:14):**  What was the one you named?  The book you named?  I believe it's year round gardening.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:30:19):**  I'm trying to take good notes.  So make sure I have these in the show notes.  Sure.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:30:25):**  I'm trying to think of.  Oh, yeah, obviously, my buddy Robert works with Ray Tyler over in Selmer, Tennessee at  Rose Creek Farm.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:30:34):**  Ray's got a couple courses and classes, but it's more so geared towards the micro greens  and lettuce and really fast, high turnover crops.  That's what Ray has really tailored his farm to a man he is killing it in terms of, you  
**[0:30:52-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:30:52):**  know.  So the biggest thing is for me, I have upgraded my garden setup this year to make it way more  hands off.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:31:03):**  I went, I'll just kind of give you a rundown of what I've done to make gardening not consume  me because I got four kids.  They're all doing baseball and we're busy in the summers, you know.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:31:16):**  So the biggest, the first thing is have a weed barrier, something to cover the soil.  I mean, this is a soil health principle.  We know this, but I'm just putting this out there.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:31:25):**  A tarp, a weed block, something that is going to hold moisture down and suppress your weed  pressure and lower the watering you have to do, help keep your soil nice and warm.  And then you cut little holes in it and put your transplants in there, cut a big long  
**[0:31:42-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:31:42):**  slit and plant a row of green beans and then weigh it down with some rebar.  And then I bought a 10,000 foot roll from dripdepot.com of irrigation tape.  And I bought some little ends.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:31:55):**  And what I do is I plug that irrigation tape through a little barb into an old garden hose.  And I run that tape all the way down there.  And I bought a $40 timer from drip depot and I punched in my schedule and then I hit go  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:10):**  and I just walk away and that thing automatically waters my whole garden.  And then I also added a little one.  This is really cool.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:18):**  Robert showed me all this from Rose Creek.  But what they do is they hook their whole greenhouse up to these in-line compost tea  fertilizer systems.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:28):**  So I, right after my water timer, it's got a little hose inlet and it goes down and sucks  the fertilizer out of this little, it's compost tea is what it is.  So like I get like a Johnson Sue compost bioreactor and put a spout on the bottom of it.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:45):**  And that goo that's coming off the bottom of it, that's highly nutrient-based compost  tea.  I just pour it in this bucket and it automatically injects all of that whole watering system  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:55):**  with compost tea.  And I don't do a thing.  That's pretty sweet.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:32:59):**  In fact, yeah, if it wasn't so windy, I'd walk out there and show it to you.  It's just right out in the front yard.  But it's man, if you tune into my Facebook page, you can add me any of you listeners  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:33:11):**  that want to check it out.  I'm going to be doing a video on it here in the next couple of days.  Just add me as a friend, Matt Klepper, K-L-E-O-P-F-E-R.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:33:17):**  Yeah, that'd be fine.  And I'll just give you a rundown of kind of what it is.  Because man, the reason why people quit gardening is nobody likes pulling weeds.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:33:29):**  Nobody likes standing out there watering.  I mean, make it so that you're resilient.  You can still do the things you need to do to prepare and you're not spent out there  
**[0:33:38-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:33:38):**  doing all this gardening stuff.  Do the setup time first and it will pay dividends later.  I've been spending time working on my corn bed because for some reason, vegetables don't  
**[0:33:52-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:33:52):**  excite me a whole lot.  And I want to try growing some really colorful heritage or indigenous varieties of flint  corn to say grind into cornmeal because that's a good way to preserve stuff.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:34:07):**  Tonya is going to try to grow some sweet corn because she wants sweet corn.  But I think that flint corn might be a little bit smarter decision because cornmeal stores  for a while.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:34:20):**  Sweet corn really doesn't without special preparation.  The hard flint corn, yeah, you can't eat it off the cob.  Is it hard to mill?  
**[0:34:31-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:34:31):**  Yeah.  There's a reason for that because it's supposed to do that to get hard to maintain all the  nutrients in it.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:34:42):**  There's a reason why those old heirloom corns were all the way up to 14, 15% protein.  And today yellow dent corn is only 8%.  Heirloom varieties know how to be scrappy with the soil and give you more.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:34:58):**  You think you're getting less because farmers are like, wow, it only yields about 100 bushel  and I can get 200 bushel out of this mon satan corn, that franken corn.  Like well, yeah, you're right.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:14):**  But what's your breakdown of trace minerals?  What's your breakdown of protein?  Well, you might need to-  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:20):**  What's your nutrient requirements for that crop?  You might.  You might only get 100 bushel, but you're getting almost double the protein.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:28):**  That's a big deal.  Not to mention the reduced input costs.  Huge.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:34):**  I mean, Monsanto is shaking and quaking in their boots right now because they don't know  how they're going to continue to survive on this high input, high feed, high output crop  system that they've designed and made everybody a slave to.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:51):**  And to me, this is great news.  I'm excited.  I'm encouraged.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:35:57):**  But-  Man, it's going to be an interesting year to be a commodity farmer.  I know.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:03):**  My father's one of them and you know what's cool.  You know what's encouraging me is we were having this conversation the other day and  he was like, yeah.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:12):**  I was telling him, I was like, I remember when grandpa used to save seed corn and seed  milo and he'd save part of that crop off and go out and sow it.  The next year he's like, yeah, I think we're going to go back to that.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:26):**  I was like, all right.  Yeah, dad.  I was scaring him off.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:31):**  I was like, oh, this is so cool.  And he's not doing it on his plots that are like right by the road where everybody else  could like.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:38):**  He's going back on the back 40, back the underways and planting him some resilient fields of  the stuff.  Nobody else can see what's going on back there.  
**[0:36:47-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:36:47):**  And he's back there planting, waiting till everybody else has all their GMOs and stuff  in the ground so it doesn't get cross pollinated and making him a little safety patch.  And there's a lot of farmers doing that and they won't ever tell you they're doing that  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:01):**  just because of peer pressure.  But there's a lot of people doing that right now.  That's really interesting.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:06):**  And that's really smart.  I mean, I have a safety patch of open pollinated seeds.  That's right.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah.  That's that's super, super smart because if the last 24 months have taught us anything,  it's that anything can happen and anything that does happen will have downstream effects  
**[0:37:30-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:30):**  that are very difficult to predict.  If you are a commodity farmer listening to this, I just want to be your biggest cheerleader.  If you have a field or something that wasn't a high producer, wasn't something that was  
**[0:37:44-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:44):**  really offering and you are in a spot where you can experiment, you can do just go out  and just try something.  I want to encourage you to do it like go back there and just get a hold of some old bloody  
**[0:37:54-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:37:54):**  butcher corn or some old like, you know, like back in the days of like Hogemeyer or all  of these early unhybridized sources of grain, turkey red wheat.  We're talking old 1800 strains of grain.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:10):**  You can still find them out there.  They're out there.  Go plant them.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:14):**  They're out there doing something, but don't continue doing what we've been doing because  it can't continue.  It can't continue.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:23):**  So there you go.  That's my encouragement.  Sometimes I find it a little bit difficult to have encouraging words for those commodity  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:34):**  farmers, but you're right.  I like that.  I really like that concept.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:38):**  It's kind of similar to what I've applied on the ranch.  You know, when I first dipped my toe in a strip grazing in 2019, it was kind of in a  corner of the ranch that I wasn't going to use for anything else.  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:38:52):**  Like okay, I've got this grass over there.  I can put something on it.  All right, I'll just put my money where my mouth is and do it.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:00):**  And it worked.  And that was three and a half percent of the land, the total land area of the ranch.  And for 2020, we converted over like almost 14% of the land over to be strip grazed.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:13):**  I still have it this year.  Didn't use it last year.  I'm going to need to do some strip grazing this year.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:19):**  I mean, just to buy days.  I de-stocked by 40%.  Like I cut my stocking rate by 40%.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:28):**  That's how worried about the drought I am.  We talked a little bit earlier about possible La Nina scenario coming in and having a wet  spring and winter or wet spring and summer.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:40):**  That's not what my crystal ball says.  My crystal ball says dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, dry.  And the trend line is dry.  
**[0:39:48-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:39:48):**  The trend line is warmer.  And you know, like I bet the handwriting has been on the wall for the drought too.  If you've been attention to the drought mitigation center or the client prediction center, you  
**[0:40:01-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:01):**  can, you can go back and you can watch that drought over the last two years creep from  the Southwest and the West.  And it's just keep it.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:09):**  It's just going East.  I don't think it's going to stop.  I think it's just going to gradually keep creeping East and North and keep getting drier  
**[0:40:17-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:17):**  and drier.  And I've never said this out loud.  Part of my theory as to why it's dry here in the Midwest is because we went down to  
**[0:40:26-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:26):**  Arizona, New Mexico and ruined the dirt down there.  Uh, it's, I mean, you look at the history of this planet, grow zones shift all the Sahara.  What's that?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:46):**  Yeah.  The Sahara desert used to be a very fertile place.  It hasn't always been desert.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:40:54):**  Um, any civilization who depletes their soil depletes themselves, Sumerians Babylonians.  I mean, it's in South America with natives.  That's why they had to keep moving around.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:41:09):**  Uh, Rome fell because their soil gave out their quote, irrigated agriculture failed,  you know, and Rome had a very similar situation to what we have.  They had a quote democratic government.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:41:22):**  They had that had been around for so long that they got a class of career politicians  that would go to the Senate and they'd be Roman senators for 30, 40 years.  Their families would be fabulously wealthy in order to keep the peace, give them bread  
**[0:41:38-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:41:38):**  and circuses, football and food stamps.  And when the entertainment value started, you know, one, not the entertainment value  when they couldn't provide food, enough food, that's when the people get really upset.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:41:59):**  When the government has told you for years, we will take care of you.  We will feed you.  We will take care of you.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:42:04):**  We will feed you.  And then an unfirst, I'm not going to say an unforeseeable event because these events  are foreseeable.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:42:13):**  They're predictable to anybody that understands complex systems theory.  Like complex systems will eventually fail.  And the more complex the system, the more failure prone it is.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:42:23):**  We're in big trouble.  Yeah, we are.  Now, I mean, we can look at this even from the value of entertainment.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:42:31):**  Look how much everyone in America is so unstimulated by the things that used to entertain us.  Like two black guys had to slap the crap out of each other to get people to even notice  that there was an Oscars award two days ago.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:42:49):**  Otherwise, nobody would have ever known that happened.  Nobody cares anymore.  People are not even watching football and baseball, the main sources of entertainment  
**[0:43:01-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:43:01):**  that people used to clue into to tailor their whole lives around to get season tickets and  their kids to play sports.  And it was all about the sports and the entertainment value.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:43:11):**  Now people are like, I really don't care.  I really don't care.  And that to me is CNN gets like what?  
**[0:43:17-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:43:17):**  A million viewers maybe.  Joe Rogan's podcast is like 11.  It's like slaying CNN by a lot on every day.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:43:30):**  He gets like he gets like 11 to 12 million listeners per episode.  Like, I don't even have a fraction of that for total downloads yet.  It's insane.  
**[0:43:42-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:43:42):**  But to me, that's encouraging is like the mainstream sources of entertainment and information  are losing their ability to manipulate and just guide the population so quickly that  they're going to resort to some pretty drastic measures here pretty soon to try and force  
**[0:44:06-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:44:06):**  control like because they're losing it that quickly.  That's what my fear is, especially with the potentials for I don't want to use this term  too loosely, but we're going to say false flag events with the whole Russian Ukraine  
**[0:44:22-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:44:22):**  thing, because all the debating that's gone on to try to bait us into this World War Three  thing, that's really the only hope they've got to continue on the track.  And to me, like, I don't want to go down that hole today.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:44:35):**  But literally, you have to, you got to see this, these moving parts coming because if  you don't understand the dire situation of how volatile this moment in human history  is, you're going to under prepare.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:44:53):**  And you need to prepare not just enough for yourself, but for your family and enough people  that could come to your place as laborers to help in the struggle.  Yeah, and that's something we need to get into a little bit before I push the button.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:45:11):**  Like the labor issue is an issue.  Yeah.  That's why there's Yeah, go ahead.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:45:17):**  Go ahead.  Well, I'm just saying like, that's already an issue with our current system.  There's crops that are literally rotting in the fields out in California, because they  
**[0:45:25-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:45:25):**  don't have the labor to pick them.  And if you're in a place where you're trying to feed yourself, there's a threshold of how  many acres you're surrounded with how much food you're trying to raise and how much manpower  
**[0:45:38-0:45:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:45:38):**  you need to help with it.  And when it comes down to a system, you cannot rely on machines to help multiply that level  of production.  
**[0:45:50-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:45:50):**  You're literally reliant on manpower.  And I was having a conversation with a contractor the other day, I says, Hey, how many men do  you have to hire today to get a job done compared to 20 years ago, because he's he just had  
**[0:46:06-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:46:06):**  these rough looking guys working for him.  And they were struggling and they were just lagging behind, you know, and he's like, man,  it used I used to be able to hire two guys, and we could work all day in the sun all year  
**[0:46:18-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:46:18):**  around just banging stuff out.  And he goes, it takes me six guys to get done today and three times the money to get done  what I used to be able to do with two.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:46:30):**  And I said, Well, what about these Amish characters?  You know, we've got a lot of Amish around us and guys are starting to really hire them  to get construction done.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:46:39):**  And they're like, man, you bring six Amish guys out in one day and crap, they can build  half a house in one day.  I mean, what what that manpower can do.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:46:48):**  But they have not lost their skills and ancestral wisdom through all this.  And people might point laughter running around riding horses and buggies.  But I'm telling you what, they're going to come out of this deal smelling like a rose.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:47:05):**  I thought for the longest time that the Amish will be the last they will have the last laugh  Amish the Mennonite, you know, that whole sect of religions that that shuns outside  world connections and doesn't rely on inputs and doesn't want to be a part of the Western  
**[0:47:22-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:47:22):**  Christian world and holds to those old older values.  And I'm probably going to catch a bunch of hell for saying this, but they also really  respect traditional gender roles.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:47:37):**  However good or bad that is, is up to interpretation.  I can see a lot of benefits in it in their culture.  And there's also some pitfalls for sure.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:47:48):**  That's I guess that's probably all we need to say about that.  But I've always admired any of the Amish or Mennonite people that I've ever had contact  with with their work ethic.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:47:58):**  They're just they're just genuine, humble and nice people.  And I even kind of had a thought one time several years ago of shaving the mustache  and running away to join the Amish.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:48:11):**  But yeah, I didn't do it, of course.  It's yeah.  And the funny part is, is like every psychologist that has studied all the different civilizations  
**[0:48:24-0:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:48:24):**  where, you know, they basically break down the barriers of the gender roles, what ends  up happening and no psychologist regurgitating this data.  But it's it is true data.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:48:36):**  It is true information that the civilizations that end up breaking down those barrier, those  gender barriers are the ones that in the long run basically destroy themselves.  And the ones that have the longest running traditions are the ones that uphold those  
**[0:48:55-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:48:55):**  and honor.  It's not from a place of like, you know, I'm not into, you know, not allowing a woman to  vote.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:49:05):**  But I am for the sake of really nurturing and protecting that sacred masculinity and  that sacred femininity, because I believe there's true power in that when we try to  mix them or or try to I mean, you see it in the fertility of animals when when you got  
**[0:49:24-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:49:24):**  bulls that are are feminine and cows that are masculine, you lose fertility issues,  bulls and big butts and cows with big shoulders.  They don't work.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:49:36):**  You can't.  And I mean, that's first we did.  It's kind of funny.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:49:41):**  First we did it to our food system and then it happened to us.  It's almost like what we do to our food system affects us.  It's like you are what you eat.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:49:53):**  What?  Never heard what you're for.  I tell you what, y'all go out there and find you a YouTube video called the red solo cup  
**[0:50:04-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:04):**  cow by Eve Campbell.  Yep.  Future guests like we are booked.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:12):**  His will be coming out like two weeks after this one.  I think I listened to a really cool video of him and Gerald Gerald Frye, Gerald Frye  and Steve Campbell.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:22):**  And it blew my mind.  But they talked about the the the kind of running onset of the fem the feminine bull  and the masculine cow.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:31):**  And I took that and ran to it from to a human standpoint.  It's like, Golly, boy, he's really right.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:37):**  Where did this crossover into humans?  Well, about not long after.  So anyway, enough of that rabbit trail.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:45):**  But yeah, Steve Campbell is booked and on the schedule would be two episodes after this  one.  Hopefully, if I don't screw that if I don't screw up recording schedule, nobody bails  
**[0:50:56-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:50:56):**  on me.  We'll have Steve Campbell on the show.  I'm honored to be on the same show that Steve Campbell is going to be on.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:51:03):**  That's cool.  Appreciate that.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:51:09):**  And you know, when I get Steve on, I we've already had a couple conversations.  We're not even probably going to talk about red solo cup cows.  Because if you want to hear about his red solo cup cow, there's a great video on YouTube.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:51:23):**  There's probably 53 other podcasts that he's done talking about red solo cup cows and remineralizing.  So we're going to tell a different part of Steve's story.  But we'll still probably talk about, you know, genetics and phenotype and whatever, because  
**[0:51:36-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:51:36):**  we like talking about that kind of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  That's cool, man.  
**[0:51:46-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:51:46):**  So local food communities, local food tribe.  How do you talk to people?  Like what do you say to somebody that's still shopping at Walmart, getting the great value  
**[0:52:01-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:01):**  brand and then going to the dollar store and getting their store brand and coming home  feeding that kids?  What do you what do you say to that neighbor right now?  
**[0:52:10-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:10):**  For one, like, do they have a basic understanding of food storage?  Like are you buying one for now and one for later?  Well, yeah.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:23):**  I mean, Twinkies don't go bad.  They store forever.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:28):**  Those canned goods, like we have a diversity of canned goods, dried goods, frozen goods  and cured goods in our basement for long term storage.  And when you're when you're talking to people and you're done trying to convince them that  
**[0:52:47-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:47):**  they need to prepare, we're past that point and people are on to the well, what do I do  and how do I do it?  Diversifying your eggs and those many different bank accounts.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:52:59):**  Right beside me in my garage, I've got a line of deep freezes here.  We have several deep freezes and frozen goods are good.  Having a deep freeze with a half a beef or something that you butchered yourself or go  
**[0:53:12-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:53:12):**  get a feeder hog and do it yourself and labor in the love and get protein frozen and get  protein cured.  Learn how to cure meat so that you don't you're not fully rely on a freezer.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:53:24):**  Yep.  I think relying on a freezer is okay for the short term.  Yep.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:53:33):**  Yep.  But I think we also need put in the back of our heads.  We need to learn how to be able to store this food and cure it if there isn't refrigeration  
**[0:53:43-0:53:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:53:43):**  available or if we run out of space.  And I'll give everybody the million dollar mineral for long term food storage.  Salt.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:53:56):**  Salt is the agent of preservation.  Salt has the ability to mobilize water through cellular walls.  And when bacteria has water in an anaerobic environment, it can proliferate uncontrollably.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:54:10):**  So if you have enough salt to preserve, you will be able to mitigate the onset of agents  like Clostridium botulinum, which is botulism, or other promiscuous bacterias and molds that  they cannot survive in a anaerobic acidic environment.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:54:28):**  So get salt, get salt now.  And make sure...  What kind of salt, Matt?  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:54:36):**  You know what?  Honestly, if it came down to it, anything is going to work.  Honestly, I mean, sure.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:54:43):**  We talked about Steve Campbell, and we know he's a big, you know, he's real high on C90  and Redmond's conditioner and Kansas independent salt.  I used C90 last year.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:54:54):**  I've got two bags of it left.  Those might actually come to the house and I'm gonna go buy a couple of pilots of Kansas  independent for the year.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:01):**  Yeah.  So that's my plan.  And maybe we should say something about why that's a good source.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:08):**  The Kansas independent salt company up there, Canopolis, they mine their salt from underground.  And that's an ancient sequestered source.  That's evaporated sea salt from an ancient, ancient sea that has none of the modern contaminants  
**[0:55:24-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:24):**  or bullshit in it.  Wow.  Yeah, like Cargill though, you could get Cargill salt and it's in an evaporation pond from  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:33):**  the surface.  C90 is still like current water.  They're evaporating and super concentrating the salt.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:40):**  Like there's a little bit higher mineral ratio in that.  Don't know a whole lot about Redmond's conditioner, but I know Steve always says, especially for  cows, that you want an ancient sequester.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:55:53):**  You want an ancient sequestered source of salt.  Not like you don't want to go buy Morton salt, iodized salt.  Because that's been, that was liquefied and then recrystallized and they added iodine  
**[0:56:06-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:56:06):**  to it.  So you're missing a lot of the trace minerals and nutrients and other little biological  thingies that are going to be in that ancient sequestered sea salt.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:56:17):**  Yeah.  And getting ourselves, like the old timers would use salt and vinegar all the time.  And the agent of fermentation is another way to preserve something like, we grew 400 pounds  
**[0:56:32-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:56:32):**  of cabbage last year.  We fermented all of it and we made 400 pounds of sauerkraut.  And I butchered two beautiful pastured pigs and turned them all into bratwurst.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:56:44):**  And we had a little German fest and that's some of the food we're going to be serving  during our garden classes.  Those homemade bratwurst and home fermented sauerkraut.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:56:55):**  It's been down in the cooler down there for months and months and months and months.  And it's still rich and crunchy when you pull it out like nothing ever happened.  And I mean, you want to talk about a powerful probiotic that keeps my immune.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:57:11):**  I have never to this day been vaccinated or worn a mask and I still have yet to catch  COVID, Brian Alexander.  Well, you have to go be in public around somebody, around other people to get it.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:57:24):**  You're like me, Matt.  I know you never, you very rarely leave.  And when you do well, stay in a small circle.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:57:32):**  I do travel a bit and I've been around a lot of people that have been around a lot of people.  Like I should have, my wife got COVID and I made her spit in my face.  I wiped her spit in my eyes.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:57:45):**  I kissed her.  I made her cough in my face and I still couldn't catch it.  I mean, it's a testament to the microbiome and the robustness of one's immune system.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:57:55):**  I stay very current on all of my supplements, which should be another point of conversation  for hard times is making sure you have enough health supplements and understanding of basic  body anatomy, physiology, and maintenance to have a good lean muscle mass, healthy metabolism  
**[0:58:15-0:58:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:15):**  and very robust immune system so that you're not an easy moving target for a virus or bacteria  to come and just wreak havoc on because man, I'm telling you what.  You already said COVID, so Spotify is going to flag me for COVID-19 content.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:33):**  If your body's immune system is functioning properly, a weak ass cold like COVID-19 won't  bother you.  I see your cup.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:41):**  I love it.  Yeah.  Can it flag that?  
**[0:58:46-0:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:46):**  Go ahead and flag that.  Whatever.  Fans, you'll have to go to YouTube to see what we're talking about.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:55):**  Right.  Sorry.  Anyway, sorry I ruined your unflagging parade.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:58:59):**  Oh, no.  It's fine.  I've already flagged a couple of my episodes.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:59:03):**  Totally cool with it.  They could flag away.  Okay.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:59:06):**  Good.  Yeah.  As far as making one not an easy target for susceptibility to cold and flu season, making  
**[0:59:18-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:59:18):**  sure your butt, like kind of almost making sure you're in fighting shape, making sure  your joints are healthy, making sure that your breathing and your metabolism, your circulatory  system, are you reaching your VO2 max every day?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:59:31):**  Are you getting out and pumping your heart rate?  Are you burning all of the glycogen out of your muscles every day?  Are your mitochondria firing at 900% or are you just a giant sack of filthy, lazy microbes?  
**[0:59:51-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=0:59:51):**  Like to me, you got to be in super resilient shape to survive.  I mean, think about it.  Like we survived out in the cold and I tell you what, my family, my daughter and I, we've  
**[1:00:08-1:00:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:00:08):**  been doing cold water therapy where we go out and we do breathing exercises and my daughter  and my wife and I, we do a, we'll jump in a giant stock tank of ice water and sit there  and learn how to be fully relaxed in an extremely stressful environment and practicing that.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:00:27):**  And my little 10 year old man, she's an animal, she's incredible.  But for us, it is a way for us to, when things are going crazy around us, we have total control  over our mental state and don't succumb to the outside environment and just stay calm.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:00:49):**  We don't let ourselves go to fight or flight when everything's going to hell in a hand  basket around us.  And you have to practice that because if you don't, before it gets there, it's going to  
**[1:00:58-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:00:58):**  literally consume you and you're not going to be able to make decisions in that high  stress environment and you're just, you're going to become a target.  Like a saying comes to mind, like when you're in the middle of the shit storm, look around  
**[1:01:15-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:01:15):**  for the one guy that's kind of calm because he's just standing there planning and he's  about ready to cut fence and bale and you better be on his leg when he moves or you're  getting left behind.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:01:24):**  That's right.  That's right.  So you're talking about supplements.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:01:30):**  What kind of supplements are you talking about?  What does Matt Clefert take?  I mean, outside of your normal daily multivitamin stuff, the biggest kickers for me are having  
**[1:01:42-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:01:42):**  adequate vitamin D first and foremost, like your testosterone as a man and your metabolism  and so many things can't function.  Your immune system cannot function at an adequate level if you are deficient in vitamin D and  
**[1:01:58-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:01:58):**  95% of the people in our area, our latitude, longitude are deficient in vitamin D.  That is first and foremost.  They just not ever go outside.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:02:09):**  Dude, here's what really made me skeptical.  Last year, I was very diligent going outside, taking my shirt off, spending time out in  the sun and all parts of the day, morning, afternoon, evening.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:02:26):**  I got a good tan.  I got lots of sun to body contact.  I was laying out in the heat of the day and I was like, man, my vitamin D has got to be  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:02:36):**  banging.  Well, our county health department had a little health fair where you could go and get your  labs drawn for free.  
**[1:02:41-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:02:41):**  You could get your testosterone, your vitamin D, your A1C, your T3, T4 thyroid panel.  I was like, cool, I'm going to go in and do that.  I went in and I was in the very lowest percentile of vitamin D and I was like, what?  
**[1:03:00-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:03:00):**  My wife, she does not get out in the sun, but she does supplement.  She does take about 25 to 30,000 international units of vitamin D a day.  She was double what I was.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:03:15):**  That's really interesting.  I was angry and I was like, there's no way.  This is not right.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:03:22):**  I started supplementing after that.  That made me a believer of like, okay, when we talk about sun, we're talking about lots  of sun.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:03:34):**  I mean, lots of sun.  I sought out some different sources on Weston A. Price and the Wise Traditions podcast about  this.  
**[1:03:47-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:03:47):**  For us to have adequate sun, I mean, we're talking way more sun than what I was doing.  The other thing is they also got vitamin D from the food and I was not doing that adequately.  Yes, vitamin D, we got a supplement.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:04:04):**  Most of us are so vitamin D deficient, it's unreal and our immune systems cannot function  without it.  The other things, I mean, small things that are not as important, but still play a pretty  
**[1:04:17-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:04:17):**  vital role, like making sure that for, especially for women, women have so many more moving  parts and the complexity of their daily health has so many more vulnerable spots to get kinked  up and out of whack with all the hormones and reproductive system and everything.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:04:37):**  Making sure that our thyroid in our body is producing adequate T3.  T3 is basically like the energy hormone and making sure that when we eat, there's a couple  cool little gadgets that can test our glucose and our insulin, like making sure our insulin  
**[1:04:54-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:04:54):**  doesn't spike.  Doctors put people on this pharmaceutical called metformin and what metformin does is  it manipulates the mTOR pathway, which is the mammalian target of rapamycin.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:08):**  Basically what it does is it tells your body not to react to high insulin and keeps your  insulin suppressed.  Well, if you were to eat a meal, when did you last eat?  
**[1:05:21-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:21):**  Last night, because I kind of did a little intermittent fasting thing.  Yeah, man.  Okay.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:26):**  That's awesome.  Good for you.  Okay.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:29):**  Let me put the asterisks there.  This morning I had my supplements, which is I take beef organ pills and honey.  So that's how I start my day with beef organ pills, honey and coffee with real heavy cream.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:46):**  That's what generally fuels me until about three, four, maybe five o'clock.  Okay.  So off of that, you got cream, which is a fat.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:05:53):**  So you are going to have an insulin spike.  It won't be very big, but you did spike insulin.  So when you spike insulin, let's say you have a high carb meal and you really spike insulin,  
**[1:06:05-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:05):**  like people that eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and then they come out and eat  it.  You have to take it.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:11):**  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, your body just goes into brain fog.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:15):**  You can't think you're tired.  You're lethargic.  Well, if you would have taken about 20 minutes after your meal and done a serious post-meal  
**[1:06:24-1:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:24):**  workout for about 15 minutes, lots of squats hit your heavy muscle groups that would suppress  your insulin 30%.  Metformin only suppresses 15%.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:38):**  So doing a post-meal workout is twice as effective as the leading pharmaceutical for insulin  resistance and type two diabetes.  I bet they don't tell you that in the TV ad.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:49):**  No.  And it's free.  You just got to get off your tail.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:06:54):**  Like knowing these things about normal basic human biology, physiology and bodily function  is imperative.  To me, it's common sense, but to your average everyday human species, they just take the  
**[1:07:11-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:07:11):**  pill and they just want to be told what to do.  I'm not out there-  That's their problem.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:07:16):**  Yeah.  I'm literally not out there to help those people right now.  Those people, they have to make the decision for themselves whether they want to survive  
**[1:07:23-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:07:23):**  or not.  And if you want to survive, go seek out the information.  I'm here to help the people that are wanting to seek out the information.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:07:32):**  A great source for ancestral wisdom on staying healthy is the Wise Traditions podcast.  My wife and I have listened to them for quite some time.  They really tap into a lot of things that are way outside the normal Western medicine  
**[1:07:54-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:07:54):**  paradigm, especially for women and childbirth, because let me tell you something.  If we go in our healthcare system is so overrun and we haven't even gotten into this, this  would be something to really think about.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:08:10):**  And we can't even get into maternity wards and basic human reproduction anymore.  Not being able to have a baby unassisted at home, maybe with a midwife is something that  most 99% of humans have never thought about.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:08:27):**  Most humans would be absolutely horrified at that thought.  It is something that, well, my wife, she has been literally preparing for, she loves babies  and reproduction and helping people have babies.  
**[1:08:45-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:08:45):**  And she has been preparing herself diligently to help people do that without all of the  amenities of Western medicine maternity wards.  At home without an epidural.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:00):**  She did the last one like that.  No epidural.  It wasn't at home, but she did it.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:07):**  She wanted to know what it felt like, what to do.  And it was insane when she began to trust her body and relax and give it time and stay  focused.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:18):**  It was amazing how the body just knew what to do and not forcing things like, you know,  you've watched so many cows be born that cow knows what to do and it's not stressed out.  It just, it goes into this.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:30):**  I actually don't sit around and watch them because it stresses them out.  Right.  Okay.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:36):**  You're, you're going to have a baby.  Cool.  I'm going to go over here and check these other cows and let you do your thing.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:41):**  I got it.  Yeah.  Humans are no different, but we pack them in this hospital with beeps and sirens and  
**[1:09:51-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:09:51):**  nurses coming in every 20 seconds.  And there's all, it's just a very high stress environment and it's so unnatural.  It's so unnatural.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:00):**  But if you're a female and that source interests you, I would encourage my wife.  She, we're planning on having a class here at the farm about human reproduction in the  age of nobody there to help.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:16):**  The age that we're getting ready to enter.  Right.  Right.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:21):**  And you know, the funny thing, like we were talking about the Amish earlier, like to them,  this is like, well, is there any other way?  I mean, everybody just has babies in their barn in their house.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:30):**  Right.  I mean, that's what everybody does.  I can imagine there's a couple Amish boys listening to this podcast that are just laughing  
**[1:10:36-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:36):**  at us.  Yeah.  And I hope so.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:40):**  Yeah.  We're, we're good friends with a bunch of Amish and Mennonite people.  And it's funny, like they, they call me like a country club Amish is what they call me.  
**[1:10:51-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:10:51):**  Cause like I know how to do a lot of the same stuff that they do, but I live a pretty ritzy  Amish life, but it's ancestral wisdom that we've got to know to survive what's coming.  I mean, there's just no way around it.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:11:07):**  So anyway, I'll drink my ivermectin and be quiet.  I'm not going to edit that out.  You've probably given me about three hours worth of work doing all the research to write  
**[1:11:19-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:11:19):**  all these show notes and make sure you get the links right.  Like this is going to be the longest show notes ever.  Sorry, brother.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:11:26):**  No, it's fine.  That's what I want.  Like that's what we need.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:11:32):**  Open doors, start conversations and you know, build relationships.  That's number one imperative.  So how much food should you be storing?  
**[1:11:48-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:11:48):**  Good question.  We have been programmed to eat three meals a day, and we're going to have to unprogram  that we have been conditioned that the normal healthy human is around, you know, a couple  
**[1:12:06-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:12:06):**  hundred pounds.  And we're going to have to unlearn that.  We're going to have to change our idea of what the human looks like and the inputs that  
**[1:12:12-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:12:12):**  it takes to feed one the same way that we've done it with our agricultural system.  We're going to have to unlearn a lot of things.  And we're also going to have to unlearn what the human body is physically capable of in  
**[1:12:24-1:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:12:24):**  terms of physical activity of getting stuff done in a day.  The human body is insanely resilient and highly physical and capable of just accomplishing  so much over a short span of time.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:12:42):**  And learning that capability, number one, is first and foremost of what is possible?  Can I do this by myself without the aid of machinery?  And how much food would it take to fuel that?  
**[1:12:55-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:12:55):**  We don't want to be this giant bulky Arnold Schwarzenegger with tons of muscle mass that  takes a ton of calories to upkeep that machine.  There's a bell curve in there where like I'm a buck seventy.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:13:08):**  How much do you weigh?  About that one.  What about one sixty one sixty five?  
**[1:13:13-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:13:13):**  Yeah, perfect.  And coming out of my winter hibernation weight.  Some are fighting weight.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:13:20):**  So when our bodies are highly conditioned and it's an efficient, physical, robust, 160,  170 pounds where our body doesn't tire down, our muscles are burning good fuel.  That is where we can make a good equation for making every single calorie count for  
**[1:13:41-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:13:41):**  something.  There's not going to be this going to the gym to work out like you're going to spend  those calories producing something productive, moving firewood, moving buckets of feed, building  
**[1:13:55-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:13:55):**  structures, carrying and moving things like that.  Food has to have a purpose.  And if you're not doing that, like tailoring your day so that your food intake that you  
**[1:14:13-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:14:13):**  do take is just enough.  You're not eating for luxury anymore.  You're literally eating for fuel to power your biological tractor for.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:14:24):**  And I'm thinking mainly for us as men to go out and get some physical stuff done.  If you're sedentary, if you don't need to be moving a lot for what you're doing, consume  a lot more fats that are going to metabolize much more slower in your body.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:14:41):**  But the need for carbohydrates in a time that we're coming into is not like what we think.  Like sugar.  Yeah, I mean, sugar is virtually worthless in a time like what is to come.  
**[1:14:57-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:14:57):**  It metabolizes super fast.  It makes your metabolism very weak.  It makes your immune system compromised.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:15:10):**  For me, like you look back at the ancestral wisdom and purpose of the family pig, how  they would cure out the fat and hang the fat in the rafters of the basement.  And they would literally eat.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:15:20):**  They would shave off slices of fat.  And it would be cured.  They would cure it with salt.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:15:26):**  And they would put that on a biscuit or a wafer or some some type of grainy piece of  bread or whatever, sourdough, whatever.  And then they would just coat it in butter.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:15:38):**  So more fat.  And then they would eat that.  And that was that was typically a meal for a housewife or somebody that was in their  
**[1:15:49-1:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:15:49):**  older years that that helped with wisdom, but didn't move around a lot.  And then you're you would save all the protein for the men or the younger women that were  doing physical things around like, you know, hand washing laundry, picking produce, doing  
**[1:16:05-1:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:16:05):**  stuff that was close to the house.  And then for your children, that was where you really kind of saved.  If you did have carbohydrates that went to the children.  
**[1:16:16-1:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:16:16):**  And that was really how you allocated your food sources based on what the job type was.  So when you ask how much food, it's a loaded question, because you have to answer these.  Well, who's in who's in my tribe?  
**[1:16:30-1:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:16:30):**  How many do I have doing physical labor?  How many do I have that are there for, you know, because we're going to go back to a  time where there ain't there ain't no nursing home to send grandpa and grandma to.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:16:41):**  It's bring them back home, set them on the front porch, asking questions, give them a  purpose for living.  The young grandchildren are that's your nursing majors like that.  
**[1:16:52-1:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:16:52):**  They care for the elders of the tribe.  That's where they learn how to have motherly fatherly instinct is caring for that generation.  That's that's near the end, you know.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:04):**  And that's also where they get their rite of passage.  Tragedy is where they they go from being adolescents into manhood or into womanhood.  You know, they cross that barrier of, you know, I accomplish something they for us,  
**[1:17:22-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:22):**  man, I really think we need to go back to having a rite of passage again, like that  line that you cross that you proved yourself.  You have, you know, the the the fruits of one's spirits that you can display high amounts  
**[1:17:35-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:35):**  of self-control and discipline and and, you know, these physical feats to prove I am a  man.  I can do this.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:44):**  It's something that shows mental toughness and resilience to.  Sure.  See, women have that built in.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:51):**  It's called childbirth.  Yeah.  We don't have that as men.  
**[1:17:56-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:17:56):**  I get that.  I can understand that.  I mean.What a woman goes through physically during childbirth, like the preparation that  
**[1:18:06-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:18:06):**  they have to do mentally for their their physical being.  We don't have anything remotely close to that for us as men.  And we used to we used to have that warrior type mentality, that mindset of protection  
**[1:18:28-1:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:18:28):**  and providing for the tribe, you know, but we've we've kind of gone away from that.  And I think that's something we need to reevaluate for us as as masculine creatures.  Yeah, I mean, but then again, you know, when we start talking about traditional gender  
**[1:18:46-1:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:18:46):**  roles and man as a protector and.  You know, that gets people upset.  It gets people upset in today's society and maybe people should be upset.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:18:59):**  Maybe people should be upset that we've strayed so far.  From anything that remotely resembles a sustainable way of living together on this planet.  The way we've been doing it isn't working.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:19:12):**  We got to make some changes.  It's I mean, psychology, there are no Western conservatives in the field of psychology,  and they hate.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:19:23):**  That breakdown of data when they study those cultures that that that break down those gender  role barriers.  But the reality of it is, is those civilizations that don't survive way longer.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:19:37):**  I mean, it just it is what it is.  I mean, it's biology.  It's.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:19:45):**  When you go against the the roles at that and you try to think like the role of GMO  God move over, we know what we're doing better.  And we try to find our identity in that.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:19:57):**  Like I am I'm not saying for a second that a woman can't go through periods of being  a protector or a provider.  But for the long term sustainability of it, they have not gone through thousands of generations  
**[1:20:15-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:20:15):**  of that role.  And when you try to go against biology and you're changing genetics from thousands of  years of genetic information.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:20:25):**  It's not going to work in one generation.  It just doesn't work like that.  So trusting what came before us for a reason, I think is at this point, we're going to find  
**[1:20:39-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:20:39):**  out if it's smart or not.  It worked, I mean, it worked for a few thousand years and it worked pretty, pretty much okay.  It's just been within the last 40 or 50 years that things have changed.  
**[1:20:53-1:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:20:53):**  Things have gone different.  And maybe it's more like 70 years.  I mean, the whole.  
**[1:21:03-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:21:03):**  Yeah.  It's more like 70 years.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:07-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:21:07):**  You know, the not saying the whole women's rights movement was bad.  No, I'm not.  I was under the impression that the CIA funded a lot of women's rights, a lot of the women's  
**[1:21:21-1:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:21:21):**  rights movements back in the sixties and seventies, because it was in the government's best interest  to get the other 50% of the people that weren't working into the workforce so they can make  income and be tax slaves.  
**[1:21:34-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:21:34):**  Brian, I'm afraid you're not wrong, man.  And because of that, now you have, look, I remember, I mean the eighties, your child  of the eighties as well.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:21:54):**  I mean, things were pretty good in the eighties.  They were in the nineties.  But things were already breaking down.  
**[1:22:02-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:22:02):**  They were.  You know, society, you know, gender roles were being broken down.  Society was being broken down.  
**[1:22:08-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:22:08):**  We lost our agricultural roots all in there from the late seventies through the eighties.  But you got to look at, I think that the height of the entertainment fad really happened at  the start of the sixties when it was cool to have status in entertainment, when the  
**[1:22:28-1:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:22:28):**  rise of the Hollywood era began.  You know, and that really was the beginning of the end.  And oh man, I'm going to have to go back and look at it.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:22:39):**  But there was a really interesting book called, it was about the patterns of Western civilization  and the four seasons of spring, summer, fall, and winter.  And it analyzed the start of winter for our civilization was 2008.  
**[1:22:55-1:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:22:55):**  That was the beginning of the end of the fall season.  I can feel that.  And we really haven't begun to come to the snow storms and the deep ends of winter until  
**[1:23:11-1:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:23:11):**  2018.  And that was really the beginning of the fall of the civilization.  And it usually takes about 30 years for it to come to a spring.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:23:25):**  But those 30 years are hard, hard, hard with a capital H.  You know, the meme has been going around.  Good times create weak men.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:23:41):**  Weak men create hard times.  Hard times create strong men.  Strong men create good times.  
**[1:23:46-1:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:23:46):**  That's right where we're at.  I mean, it's not, it's not hard.  How are we going to live through it, Matt?

**[1:24:40-1:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:24:40):**  now.  Get rid of the RV, get rid of the boat, get rid of the golf clubs.  Get rid of the season tickets at the racetrack and get yourself to a point where you are  
**[1:24:53-1:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:24:53):**  a warriors travel flight.  Yes.  Okay.  
**[1:24:58-1:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:24:58):**  So don't, don't be super weighed down with tons of things and stuff and equipment and,  and anything that you can cut ties to that allow you to be to a point where if you have  to basically relocate or translocate somewhere, having family, you know, just have a good  
**[1:25:18-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:25:18):**  phone evening, phone conversation in a cold beer with a family member that maybe he's  got that 40 acre back farm or something like, Hey man, I let's, let's talk, let's talk crazy  for a while.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:25:31):**  It, it, it, it, it stuff really got bad.  Could we meet out at the old barn back at the, the, the, the mulberry patch when we  were kids?  
**[1:25:39-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:25:39):**  And I used to go fishing at, and I mean, you need to have a bug out.  It's kind of fun to talk about, honestly, to have a bug out location and in a place  in your mind and a packet of seeds and I have a bug out bag, my wife and I do.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:25:56):**  And we have, where are you going to go?  For me?  Yeah.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:01):**  I used to have a bug out bag packed, but then I started thinking, where the hell am I going  to go?  Like, it's that bad out here, there's nowhere left to go.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:11):**  My problem is, is we are really close to a main highway.  So for me, if it got that bad and we're talking, it's gotta be really bad.  Like the roving armed game stage.  
**[1:26:25-1:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:25):**  Right.  Right.  Uh, I hopefully we're still two years away from yeah, but we're always nine meals away  
**[1:26:34-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:34):**  from complete cacophony.  Yes.  And if that started right now, okay.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:39):**  What is today?  Tuesday, Monday.  What is it?  
**[1:26:44-1:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:44):**  Be Friday.  Yeah.  Friday.  
**[1:26:47-1:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:47):**  We would, we would literally be, we would literally be pointing guns at other humans,  killing them to get food by Friday.  What do you think about that for changing your plans?  
**[1:26:57-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:26:57):**  If that doesn't motivate you like, Oh, it'll be fine.  We'll we'll wait.  There's no waiting guys.  
**[1:27:04-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:04):**  It'll be better next year.  We just got a pre-buy and be smart this year.  Things will be better next year.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:11):**  You've got to start planning for major life shifting events.  And if you're not, I don't know what to tell you.  I don't, there's nothing you or I can do.  
**[1:27:25-1:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:25):**  Like I say, we're done trying to wake up sheep.  We've got the lions awake.  We're trying to equip them with whatever they think they need to make their, their lion  
**[1:27:35-1:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:35):**  pride, uh, be able to survive.  And that's what I'm about.  I'm not in this anymore to try and wake up sheep.  
**[1:27:44-1:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:44):**  That time has passed.  You're not awake.  Wake the rest of the lions and get them to sharpen their fangs.  
**[1:27:51-1:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:51):**  That's right.  Yup.  It's go time.  
**[1:27:54-1:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:54):**  Okay.  We can't end on that.  Build the arc.  
**[1:27:59-1:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:27:59):**  So what is the arc?  What is Matt's metaphysical arc look like that you're building?  Yeah, man.  
**[1:28:08-1:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:28:08):**  It's a, it's a place that people can go to, to reclaim their, their physical, emotional,  nutritional needs and have them met at a very deep level of connection with people that  are like-minded many people, when they come to our home, we share dinner tables with a  
**[1:28:38-1:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:28:38):**  very diverse crowd.  I'm a musician.  I grew up in a very liberal, uh, you know, I went to school with, uh, at a liberal arts  
**[1:28:48-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:28:48):**  college for 10 years.  Nobody holds that against you.  It's okay.  
**[1:28:53-1:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:28:53):**  Yeah.  It's, it's just part of who I am.  And I have conversations with people that are on that side with that mindset.  
**[1:29:02-1:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:29:02):**  And I have people that I share a table with that are gun toting, Bible slinging, patriotic.  I mean, that's more of who I am, but I'm saying the diversity of thought that you can surround  yourself with is key.  
**[1:29:22-1:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:29:22):**  If you are somebody who is a very creative type person, and you do not have a very strict,  highly disciplined business, like mindset, you need to put people like that in your tribe.  They're going to seem very rigid and not fun to be around, but they're, they're going to  
**[1:29:40-1:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:29:40):**  save your life.  If you're somebody like me, that's a, that's a dreamy, just out there, super creative,  highly sociable person.  
**[1:29:50-1:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:29:50):**  You need to, you need to surround yourself.  People that seem like they're super rigid, closed off introvert that are very good with  numbers and have an engineered type mindset.  
**[1:30:01-1:30:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:30:01):**  Put people like that in your tribe, people that are not like you that don't think like  you that necessarily aren't going to be your quote unquote best friends, but people that  have the will to survive and see the, they have an open mind and they know that you're  
**[1:30:17-1:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:30:17):**  different.  That's imperative going forward.  Somewhere in everybody's friend circle is that one guy that's standing quietly in the  
**[1:30:29-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:30:29):**  corner, watching the chaos, getting ready to cut fence and run.  Maybe that's you.  If that's not you, you better find that guy in your friend circle.  
**[1:30:37-1:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:30:37):**  And if he's not there, you need to go find one.  Yep, absolutely.  Next thing is, is making your space highly protectable from a security standpoint.  
**[1:30:52-1:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:30:52):**  Making yourself resilient.  Like do you know how to defend your own castle?  Do you have the ability if you are not reliant on 911, can you clear your own home with a  
**[1:31:03-1:31:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:03):**  firearm?  Can you protect your own family?  Can you get to a location outside if you're in a highly populated high density area?  
**[1:31:16-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:16):**  Can you get out of there?  Do you know the quickest route?  Do you know the terms to make to get out of town the back way?  
**[1:31:23-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:23):**  And where are you going?  You brought up an excellent point earlier that I kind of wanted to go back and hit on.  Like you'll call up Uncle Frank that might still have 40 acres of the farm.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:39):**  I get that.  That's possible for a lot of people.  But there's a lot of folks in this country, probably, I don't know, 100 million or so,  
**[1:31:48-1:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:48):**  that don't have any sort of generational connection anywhere to any sort of land base or family  farm.  What do we have to say to those guys?  
**[1:31:57-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:31:57):**  Literally, I'm not kidding, Brian.  Number two, the Hunger Games part of this.  That's why I said the number one thing to do is build relationships.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:32:07):**  I don't care that you don't have that connection to family or somebody like that.  If you are somebody that doesn't have that and you go out to a farmer who's lonely and  you know how to build a relationship, the most common, simple thing that should be second  
**[1:32:22-1:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:32:22):**  nature to every human and you can build a relationship of trust.  You now have a way to survive.  It is through relationships, period.  
**[1:32:37-1:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:32:37):**  I made a video a couple of days ago called rules without relationships breed rebellion.  The relationship is the most natural thing to the human species and we've been building  them for thousands of years.  
**[1:32:50-1:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:32:50):**  If you can't build a relationship with somebody that can help you survive and you don't have  skills to offer them to help them, well, I don't want to sound mean but you are virtually  pretty much worthless to helping people survive.  
**[1:33:10-1:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:33:10):**  You have to have a skill to offer and if you don't, acquire one.  If your skill is NFT trading, I'm sorry, that's not going to grow a whole lot of corn.  Get in fighting shape.  
**[1:33:25-1:33:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:33:25):**  At least be a physical specimen that you can offer physical labor unassisted that isn't  just a nag complaining box that you can work your butt off and nobody needs to check up  on you and you are a liability health-wise.  
**[1:33:47-1:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:33:47):**  That's a game winner right there.  Do you ever remember hearing any stories from the great depression, 1920s, 1930s, Dust Bowl  Depression era of people going out and just saying, hey, if I work for you all day today,  
**[1:34:08-1:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:34:08):**  can I just sleep in your barn?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  What's that going to look like in modern times?  
**[1:34:18-1:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:34:18):**  It's so hard for people to even imagine.  In the Bible, they talked about a whole day's wage for, I forget the measurement they use,  but it was basically the equivalent to like three pounds of barley, basically working  
**[1:34:32-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:34:32):**  your butt off from sunup to sundown for three pounds of barley.  People are like, that's biblical times.  Okay, well, that happened several other times between the time of Moses and the time of  
**[1:34:48-1:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:34:48):**  now, these famines that wiped across the world.  One of them just happened to be within the last hundred years where people, like you  said, would work a whole day's wages for scraps on the ground and to sleep on a hay bed in  
**[1:35:08-1:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:35:08):**  a barn.  They might travel down the road to the next homestead because they didn't have a car,  they were on foot.  
**[1:35:17-1:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:35:17):**  Going back to that, I think what's first going to happen is there's going to be another COVID  like thing that's going to cause a very large decline in human population.  I think that's interesting.  
**[1:35:31-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:35:31):**  You're the first person I've heard to say anything about another pandemic soon.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  
**[1:35:40-1:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:35:40):**  Yeah, that's going to happen.  I've been running like crypto circles and decentralized stuff.  I'm a part of some different conversations lately, disease illness, another pandemic.  
**[1:36:01-1:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:36:01):**  That hasn't been on my radar.  It doesn't seem like world governments, quote, those in power, the lizard people, whatever  the hell we want to call them.  
**[1:36:14-1:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:36:14):**  I would think that they would be hesitant to try to use that tool again so quickly,  especially after all the lies that have been uncovered in the last six months.  Okay, well, did you notice how fast COVID dissolved?  
**[1:36:29-1:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:36:29):**  Did you notice how as soon as the Ukrainian war came up, it was like, oh, it's over.  COVID was going to end at the end of March because that's when the mandate on airplanes  expired.  
**[1:36:44-1:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:36:44):**  When they made the federal mandate to expire, I think it was like March 18th, March 19th,  to fly on an airplane, you had to wear a mask that quit.  When that went away, COVID stopped.  
**[1:36:58-1:37:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:36:58):**  Every other mask mandate came off and nobody's been talking about it.  Coincidence or causation that you know, the Russian invasion of Ukraine?  Don't know if it's causation or coincidence, but you know, all within a span of a few days,  
**[1:37:12-1:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:12):**  we quit talking about COVID, the federal mask mandate on airplanes went away and Russia  invaded Ukraine and nobody's talking about COVID anymore.  All we're talking about is how terrible Ukrainian people are.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:25):**  This is a whole other can of worms in itself.  For the listeners, this was recorded literally two weeks ago before release date.  Things might be a little bit weird now to date, but the way I understand it, Ukraine  
**[1:37:40-1:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:40):**  is a very corrupt country anyway.  Their government was corrupt.  They were not necessarily good people.  
**[1:37:46-1:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:46):**  Are the Ukrainian people good people?  Just like the American people, we're good people.  Our government does some fucked up shit.  
**[1:37:53-1:37:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:53):**  Same with the Ukrainians.  The people in power had done some pretty messed up stuff.  That doesn't mean Putin's a saint.  
**[1:37:59-1:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:37:59):**  That doesn't let him off the hook because he is a bad guy.  Like he is not a nice man.  He is not a good man.  
**[1:38:08-1:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:38:08):**  I mean Putin is Putin.  He has all the Russian citizens believing that the reason they had to go to Ukraine  was because the Ukrainians wanted him there and Ukraine is run by Nazis.  
**[1:38:22-1:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:38:22):**  That's what Putin is telling his people.  It's not like Russia doesn't have a long history of propaganda.  They call it Maskirovka.  
**[1:38:33-1:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:38:33):**  It's not like they don't have a long history of that.  How do we know what's true?  Your eyebrows are going up.  
**[1:38:43-1:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:38:43):**  How do we know what's true?  We know that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Google, they are giving us 100% a  curated feed to try to monetize our attention and they show us the worst shit possible.  
**[1:39:05-1:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:39:05):**  It's driving us down this road where we're sensationalizing attention, monetizing attention  and the things that hold your attention are horrible things.  Other people suffering.  
**[1:39:14-1:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:39:14):**  Is there like massive suffering in Ukraine by the Ukrainian people?  100%.  But what's happened there is going to have far, far ranging effects on energy, on food  
**[1:39:31-1:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:39:31):**  production, on human settlement patterns, on the world economics as a whole.  We've said it several times.  We're entering an unprecedented time in human history.  
**[1:39:47-1:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:39:47):**  The rate of change of our societies is faster than it has ever been at any point in history.  The velocity of information blows my mind.  I'm in my mid 40s.  
**[1:40:07-1:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:40:07):**  You're a few years younger than you're almost 40.  Yes.  I turned 37 in a couple of weeks.  
**[1:40:14-1:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:40:14):**  Just a pup.  But we're not that much different in age.  We grew up and saw a lot of the same stuff.  
**[1:40:28-1:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:40:28):**  Looking back from now, how long has the handwriting been on the wall?  How long have we been able to speak the language to read that handwriting on the wall or has  it always been there and we've just walked by it with blinders on?  
**[1:40:47-1:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:40:47):**  For me, it jumped out and clotted me at 2016.  That was when I saw the writing on the wall.  The Hillary Trump election cycle was when I saw the potential for the...  
**[1:41:05-1:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:41:05):**  Because I think what's going on right now was actually planned for if Hillary won the  election.  It was sidetracked when Trump took out and kind of threw...  
**[1:41:19-1:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:41:19):**  You think we're four years behind the big master evil plan or whatever?  Look at how much China and Russia have prepared themselves going in.  I mean China is sitting on 60% of the world's grain supply right now.  
**[1:41:37-1:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:41:37):**  They've bought most of that in the last four years?  Yeah.  To me, when I saw that happening, I felt this huge rush of urgency during that.  
**[1:41:53-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:41:53):**  I felt a breath of fresh air and a sigh of relief when the election didn't go as expected.  It bought me some time to really get things solidified in my homestead, really ironed  out.  
**[1:42:09-1:42:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:42:09):**  I got a ton of things in place in a short amount of time.  As far as food sovereignty, food resiliency, building my network, building my tribe, I  did all that all throughout the Trump presidency.  
**[1:42:27-1:42:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:42:27):**  I didn't pay attention to what was going on.  My focus was build, build, build, build, build, build, build.  Yeah.  
**[1:42:37-1:42:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:42:37):**  2016 was where me and a lot of other people that I've started to connect in my tribe really  felt this shift going on in the energy of, I don't know, just daily life, daily civilization.  People made life altering decisions, quitting their job, relocating, just doing a lot of  
**[1:42:56-1:43:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:42:56):**  things differently and not apologizing for it.  That was a big signal to me that really helped me have the confidence that believing in what  I was doing for the right reasons was when I started looking around and I go, man, there's  
**[1:43:11-1:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:43:11):**  a lot of other people doing what I'm doing.  I'm just going to keep my head down and keep going.  I have the last two years been a lot of validation for you?  
**[1:43:23-1:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:43:23):**  For me, it's like having conversations with people and when you're testing out the water  to see how awake a person is and a new acquaintance and you'll throw out certain like, what are  those little niblets of information just to see how they react to them.  
**[1:43:41-1:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:43:41):**  Like, oh yeah, this person does know about that.  Okay.  So now we're onto this level of trust.  
**[1:43:46-1:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:43:46):**  Let's see if they know about this.  And you go down and it's like, people put on this front of like, they kind of pretend  like they're just an average everyday human.  
**[1:43:56-1:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:43:56):**  And then you start unpacking stuff and you're like, holy crap, you're really switched on.  You really know what's going on.  Oh yeah, actually we've been, we sold everything and bought an RV and we're living in the back  
**[1:44:07-1:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:07):**  woods and oh, wow.  Okay, cool.  I don't know.  
**[1:44:11-1:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:11):**  It's just nice to know you're not alone when you put your head down and go in a rabbit  hole and prepare for so long.  It's like, okay, we're going to get through this.  
**[1:44:19-1:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:19):**  We have a lot of people that are switched on, ready to rock and roll.  And that's a comforting feeling knowing you're not alone.  You know?  
**[1:44:28-1:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:28):**  So, and that's why it's important to build community and build relationships.  So we don't have to go through this alone or alone as a single human, even alone as  a family unit, because even a good family unit like yours, whether you're four kids,  
**[1:44:46-1:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:46):**  I know they work their butts off.  I know you work your butt off.  I know your wife works hard, but is it enough?  
**[1:44:54-1:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:44:54):**  No, it's not.  But I think there's a sweet spot where you also can't worry about feeding the world,  but I think, you know, the average size you look at, like, look at the Native American  
**[1:45:04-1:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:45:04):**  population when they had a tribe or a single gathering, how many teepees would you usually  see at a normal campsite?  They had a chief and how many people would that chief oversee?  
**[1:45:16-1:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:45:16):**  You know, when they survived as a normal, you know, small groups, they might have a  big tribe of Cherokee or Cheyenne Indians that would be thousands of thousands of people.  But when they stayed together in these small units, what was the most right?  
**[1:45:33-1:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:45:33):**  What was the most resilient size that didn't make you an easy target that you could travel  light that you could accomplish a lot?  You didn't have too many mouths to feed.  
**[1:45:43-1:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:45:43):**  You didn't have too many people.  You know, you had the right amount of warriors to protect and go hunt.  You had the right amount of children to help do small hands on things.  
**[1:45:53-1:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:45:53):**  And once you got to a certain size, just like a beehive, you would split.  Right.  You know, I totally with you on the concept, but I'm not familiar with the exact research  
**[1:46:05-1:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:46:05):**  or maybe the book or paper you're talking about.  But I know the number.  I think the number is about 150.  
**[1:46:11-1:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:46:11):**  Yeah, yeah, I think the number is about 150.  Dunbar's number, maybe something I heard on another podcast, probably Rogan, who knows?  But like, there's a set of numbers, you know, you can maintain intimate connections with  
**[1:46:30-1:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:46:30):**  X number of people, like, that's really smart.  You can maintain close friendships with X number of people.  And you know, that gets out to you can sustain emotional connections to a community of about  
**[1:46:46-1:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:46:46):**  150 to 200 people.  So I would theorize that like 150 is kind of like the minimum stable nucleus size for  a band.  
**[1:46:58-1:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:46:58):**  And when that band grows to about 300, then it's time to split.  And like, I see similarities in Amish and Mennonite community, right?  Okay, yeah, oh, you and I can sit here and we can have a common frame of reference to  
**[1:47:14-1:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:47:14):**  talk about Amish and Mennonite people.  And we have a very, we have a solid shared understanding of what that is.  But our shared understanding is, let's just say, 80%.  
**[1:47:26-1:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:47:26):**  Because that 20% that we don't have shared understanding, that goes down to the specific  church or the specific band that's led by their religious figure, by their, you know,  by their leader that they recognize as their leader.  
**[1:47:42-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:47:42):**  Similarly, we have the way a lot of American Indian tribes or indigenous American tribes  function is very similar.  They would have a chief who was not necessarily the greatest warrior, the greatest farmer,  
**[1:47:55-1:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:47:55):**  the greatest horseman, or whatever.  He was they were, and maybe it wasn't just one guy, it was a council of several, and  they would, you know, put their wisdom together to decide what's in the best interest of this  
**[1:48:11-1:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:48:11):**  band.  But I think it's important to have some sort of leadership accountability that, because  if you just have one or two people that are in charge of everything, not saying it always  
**[1:48:28-1:48:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:48:28):**  happens, but when when just one person is in charge, a lot of times what will happen  is they'll start making decisions that benefit them more than it benefits everybody else.  Or they'll make a decision that benefits everybody, but really benefits them the most.  
**[1:48:45-1:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:48:45):**  And I think when you have a group that is, you know, running the society or that's determining  the direction of where that band or tribe is going to go and what they're going to do,  or how they're going to interact, or how they're going to handle a situation, you bring in  
**[1:49:00-1:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:00):**  the wisdom of a group.  And that's actually a ranching for profit thing, is the answer is in the group.  People always ask me, what do you learn at ranching for profit?  
**[1:49:13-1:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:13):**  Well, what you learn the first day is the answers in the group.  So I like that.  Yeah, that's why they have you sit in tables of six.  
**[1:49:23-1:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:23):**  That's why there's groups of six businesses or the table of six at ranching for profit,  because the answer is in the group.  Like singularly, I might score a 50 on a test.  
**[1:49:35-1:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:35):**  You might score a 95 and four other people might score in the sixties.  But that one thing that you've got wrong, we've all got right.  And that's why the answer's in the group because there's shared wisdom and collaboration and  
**[1:49:50-1:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:50):**  shared knowledge.  That's right.  Yep.  
**[1:49:54-1:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:49:54):**  Yep.  So, and when you have a group of leadership versus a singular leader, when the band gets  too big, the leadership group can also split and maintain some sort of consistency.  
**[1:50:13-1:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:50:13):**  And you know what we saw, not what we saw with what I understand about native American  tribes primarily kind of live between where you're at and where I'm at, which you get  much west to here and south, it was more Comanche area and it was Comanches and Kiowas and they  
**[1:50:29-1:50:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:50:29):**  were, you know, they're a rating.  They weren't necessarily, they didn't have towns.  There is that one settlement that's like right in between us on the Arkansas river that they  
**[1:50:40-1:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:50:40):**  found that's what, 12,000 years old.  Maybe I have a number wrong, but they found a native American settlement very close to  the Arkansas river, not far from Winfield.  
**[1:50:53-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:50:53):**  Maybe it's art city that had several thousand people.  And it was a permanent, like it was a permanent housing place for indigenous Americans for  hundreds, if not thousands of years.  
**[1:51:07-1:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:51:07):**  Wow.  That's cool.  There, there were communities and you'd have tribes that would come together or you'd have  
**[1:51:19-1:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:51:19):**  these little bands that would come together for festivals and tribes.  But the social connections, the social fabric, I'm not sure that we're capable of maintaining  more than about 150, maybe 300 social connections to anybody.  
**[1:51:36-1:51:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:51:36):**  I might be doing good.  I might be doing good to break a hundred, but it takes all kinds of folk to make the  world go round.  
**[1:51:45-1:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:51:45):**  And I think that the rise of social media, the explosion of social media in the last  10 years, and especially the last five years, they're like, we're replacing that 150 person  community with followers on Facebook or fans on Instagram or whatever.  
**[1:52:07-1:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:52:07):**  They're not really your friends.  Some of them are, some of them are really your friends.  But are your, do I feel like my Instagram followers are going to come out and help me  
**[1:52:18-1:52:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:52:18):**  work up my corn patch this month?  Probably not.  Well, if you haven't get a one to have some of that corn come like July, August, September,  
**[1:52:28-1:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:52:28):**  you bet they will.  Yeah.  But I think there's a quite a few people that I've met in my, my close circle of influence  
**[1:52:37-1:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:52:37):**  of people that have found me on the Facebook platform that I feel like for us that are  into this sustainable type lifestyle that are purely following us just for that simple  aspect that are seeking those people out to go, man, I know that if I got myself close,  
**[1:52:54-1:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:52:54):**  I, you know, Matt would be somebody or Brian would be somebody that I would want to surround  myself with in that type of circumstance.  And I've, I've had those conversations and there are those people that are trying to  
**[1:53:07-1:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:07):**  connect themselves, you know, on these digital platforms for that basic reason.  So if you're, if you're one of those people and you haven't met them in person yet, or  you haven't had that conversation via messenger, or at least have their, their contact information  
**[1:53:24-1:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:24):**  or phone number, now would be a good time to do that.  Like now.  Yeah.  
**[1:53:30-1:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:30):**  Work on that connection before you need it.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[1:53:35-1:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:35):**  Especially if you don't have it.  I mean, you're ready to wrap this up.  Yeah, brother.  
**[1:53:41-1:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:41):**  Let's do it.  All right.  What do you want to talk to me?  
**[1:53:44-1:53:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:44):**  What do you want to ask me?  Where is your, your number one focus in the next 60 days?  Like what are the, what are the, what are the variables that you're watching to help  
**[1:53:57-1:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:53:57):**  you know, the temperature of the pot of water?  What signs are you watching that are causing you to shift the velocity at which you move?  Well, there's a lot to unpack there.  
**[1:54:15-1:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:54:15):**  So geopolitically, that's a wildcard.  That's a crapshoot.  I don't see, I don't see the situation improving or things just magically resolving themselves  
**[1:54:26-1:54:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:54:26):**  overnight.  We're headed for future, you know, more supply chain disruptions, rising input, rising input  costs, rising fuel costs, and displacement of people.  
**[1:54:39-1:54:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:54:39):**  Like that's what I see coming down the line.  What am I doing?  About all I can really focus on right now is trying to make sure we get a garden in  
**[1:54:51-1:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:54:51):**  and keep, keep alive what we can keep alive in the garden and try to grow as much food  as we can save seeds.  My cow herd, you know, we're looking down the barrel of high input costs and I'm already  
**[1:55:07-1:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:55:07):**  starting to think about what I'm going to do next winter for protein for my cows.  Because this winter I've just been feeding alfalfa because it's cheap and it's available.  And I mean, next year the price is going to go up.  
**[1:55:20-1:55:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:55:20):**  Am I going to be able to afford to do that?  I don't know.  So we might go ahead and ratchet back the inputs again.  
**[1:55:28-1:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:55:28):**  I get all my cows.  I mean, you want to talk about low input program.  They're going to get salt in the summer and alfalfa in the fall and winter.  
**[1:55:36-1:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:55:36):**  And that's about it.  That's about as low input as I can get a cow.  The guys that, you know, are relying on a lot of inputs, a lot of DDGs or, you know,  
**[1:55:48-1:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:55:48):**  things that require one or two processing steps from the field before it gets to their  cows, your costs are going to just get nuts.  I mean, even if you're feeding a straight corn, your costs are going to get nuts.  
**[1:56:03-1:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:03):**  I don't think very many people have a concrete understanding of just how weird things could  get this year.  And I'm not going to say that I have a concrete understanding of how weird things can get  
**[1:56:18-1:56:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:18):**  this year.  I've seen how weird they've been in the last two years.  Okay.  
**[1:56:23-1:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:23):**  Multiply it by a thousand and just plan for that.  Yeah, that's, I'm with you, man.  That's what I'm talking about.  
**[1:56:34-1:56:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:34):**  Okay.  Well, buddy, it's been great to chat with you today.  Me too, brother.  
**[1:56:41-1:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:41):**  I really enjoyed it.  I really enjoy you.  I always enjoy you, Matthew Cleffer.  
**[1:56:46-1:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:46):**  I enjoy seeing you.  You're always, always have something positive to say.  And you always really make me think.  
**[1:56:52-1:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:52):**  Yeah, man.  Likewise.  Yeah.  
**[1:56:56-1:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:56:56):**  We have good conversation.  That's what I appreciate about you is the conversation.  One of these days where schedules will actually meet up and you'll have a thing and I won't  
**[1:57:05-1:57:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:05):**  have a thing and I'll be able to make it over.  And yeah, man, it'll happen when it's supposed to happen.  That's right.  
**[1:57:13-1:57:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:13):**  It'll happen.  Maybe it'll be a Gail's field school, but that's still a really long ways out.  So keep, keep your ears open.  
**[1:57:20-1:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:20):**  We'll, we'll make it happen somewhere.  Someday we'll make it happen.  I mean, if fuel gets cheap again, maybe I'll just take her.  
**[1:57:26-1:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:26):**  Maybe I'll just jump in the truck, take a roadie.  Do it, man.  That's right.  
**[1:57:31-1:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:31):**  I'm wait till my I'm back on my feet and not suffering again.  And I'm a hundred percent.  It might be a couple of weeks before I get there.  
**[1:57:40-1:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:40):**  Cause I've not heeded the doctor's advice.  We'll just say that.  So we're not even going to, not even going to look at that rabbit or follow the whole,  
**[1:57:50-1:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:50):**  follow the trail that it's going down.  We'll just let that one.  We'll just let that one go.  
**[1:57:55-1:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:57:55):**  But yeah, you did tell me earlier and I wish you the best.  Yeah.  Thank you.  
**[1:58:01-1:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:58:01):**  No, it's probably not a whole lot of fun.  Yeah.  Nope.  
**[1:58:05-1:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:58:05):**  Nope.  I wish you the best in a speedy recovery.  Yeah, man.  
**[1:58:09-1:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/60-Matt-Kleopfer-Build-your-Ark-e1h6gfs#t=1:58:09):**  Thank you.  I'm going to keep building my arc and getting ready for go time.  Cause yup.

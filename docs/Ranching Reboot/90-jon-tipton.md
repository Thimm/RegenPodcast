**[0:01:42-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:01:42):**  And and we were able to get the USDA to kind of I guess reimburse us for the loaded miles, which was nice  Is that one of those drought relief programs? Yeah, I think so. I think so. Okay, cool  So, um, well before we get like too far deep into the weeds  
**[0:02:00-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:00):**  So you're John Tipton. Yes, sir. Tell us a little bit about where you're at and about your operation  We can start chasing rabbits from there  So I'll start from the beginning my dad  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:12):**  bought  46 acres in  Lavaca County, Texas, which is in Howlett's Ville  
**[0:02:19-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:19):**  He bought that place in 1980. He had commercial herd. I remember him saying yeah like a Hereford bull at one point  and then he  Started getting into beef masters in 1985  
**[0:02:34-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:34):**  and  From his his good friend and mentor who was a beef master breeders  Universal  
**[0:02:43-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:43):**  charter member at the time and  There heard kind of  That that gentleman's name was Leon Barnes senior a brushy Creek beef masters. He's no longer with us  
**[0:02:55-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:02:55):**  Unfortunately, but he was very great mind. I grew up with him  You know knowing him he knew me and and that's kind of how we got started  And we just you know growing up. I always knew that I wanted to raise beef master cattle  
**[0:03:11-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:03:11):**  It's all I knew I was born in 88. So I was luckily born into it  So it's just  Aside from you know, I've always had this goal in mind when I was a kid that I wanted to have a big ranch  
**[0:03:24-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:03:24):**  I wanted beef master cattle and I wanted to raise a family on that ranch too. So that's that's one goal that I've never  Set aside or put in the backseat or gotten rid of I've always kept that goal in mind and it's still in the works  I'm about to get married in December  
**[0:03:43-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:03:43):**  Congratulations, I appreciate that and you know, I'm just trying to hone in on my craft and get better at beef master cattle  Awesome so  What's the land base you're on you said you started with about 40 acres or so 60 it's 40 it's at 46  
**[0:04:00-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:04:00):**  And we still have that place  And then we lease about a hundred and twenty  I don't know about 20 minutes away nor just northwest of Schulenburg  
**[0:04:12-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:04:12):**  And then I have 85 acres in Anouac, Texas, which is three hours east  it's all it's between baytown and Beaumont, but we don't keep cattle down there because I  Got tired of evacuating cattle because of hurricanes. It's it's like right on the coast. So I got you know  
**[0:04:28-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:04:28):**  Okay, but help me orient you said you're at how it's bill. Yeah. So so where's that in, Texas? Okay, so  I'm I grew up in Houston  That's it's so how it's bill if you go an hour and a half west of Houston on i-10  
**[0:04:45-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:04:45):**  You hit Schulenburg, Texas exit Schulenburg go south on 77 about  10 15 minutes. That's where our place is and then  How it will what you call that South Texas or so? Yeah, I do I call it South, Texas  
**[0:05:01-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:05:01):**  and so our place is about  You know 10 minutes south of Schulenburg on  77 and then how it feels 20 minutes south of Schulenburg on 77. So I'm kind of halfway between Schulenburg and how it's bill  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:05:17):**  Okay  Yeah, I can start naming off a bunch of towns in Kansas and even less people will have heard of them  Even less people will have heard of them. Right, right, right  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:05:27):**  All right  I didn't mean to interrupt you you're talking about the different properties you had you said you had one you had one  okay, so  
**[0:05:35-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:05:35):**  The property in Anawak. It's I don't know about an hour east of Houston  And so by that time you start to get real close to the bay  and so  
**[0:05:47-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:05:47):**  We bought that place in June of 99 and so  It's it's  Best hunting property in Texas in my opinion. You can cover anything they got Gators  
**[0:06:02-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:06:02):**  They got waterfowl ducks geese everything they got deer  Hogs anything you can think of it's to me. It's the hunting Mecca of Texas. There's Gators around Houston  Yeah, it's not I mean we're kind of a bayou I guess you could say I did I  
**[0:06:20-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:06:20):**  Never thought about it. But it I mean it makes sense that there'd be Gators in southeast, Texas. Mm-hmm  Oh, yeah right on the coast. It's there's a lot of Gators. I would I would consider that area which is  Where Anawak is its Chambers County, Texas. I would consider that like the Louisiana of Texas it is  
**[0:06:39-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:06:39):**  It feels more like Louisiana than anywhere else in, Texas  You know pretty much from there on east going along I-10  It's there's a lot of swamps  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:06:51):**  You know marshy areas  they  Not so much anymore, but they still do it some they did a lot of rice farming  
**[0:07:00-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:07:00):**  And stuff like that, but it's very  Very much a hunting region of Texas  Okay  
**[0:07:09-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:07:09):**  Okay, um, so back to your main place like I'm I'm familiar with where Kingsville is where  Hungerford is  Let me see I would it's uh  
**[0:07:24-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:07:24):**  It's a few few hours north because I'm because I know like Houston and where the ranch is it's about I  Don't know six hours from the border  Rio Grande City border, okay  
**[0:07:37-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:07:37):**  So I'd say Kingsville is roughly three hours south  So you're you're up there a little closer to  San Antonio, we could put Texas geography whenever you want  
**[0:07:51-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:07:51):**  Well, no  so the the easiest way I can put it for people is it's exactly halfway between Houston and San Antonio on I-10 and  Then go south about 15 minutes  
**[0:08:03-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:08:03):**  Okay  Okay, that works. I like to tell people that I'm like when I start naming towns in Kansas like, you know  I just get blank looks. I'm like, alright look, I'm 20 miles from Oklahoma halfway from Oklahoma halfway from Colorado to Missouri. Yeah  
**[0:08:18-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:08:18):**  Okay  So that's the land that covers the land  Seems like that that seems like you're gonna have to spend a lot of time on the road moving  
**[0:08:27-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:08:27):**  I did and so and so that's why I kind of quit put bringing cattle to  and  Anahuac because and it was nice whenever I didn't have whenever there was a serious drought in how it's feel because  
**[0:08:40-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:08:40):**  the thing about how it's feel is  It during the the fall and spring grass is good  in  
**[0:08:49-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:08:49):**  The winter if you plant winter grass, it's good in certain places, but it also  Depends on pasture management, but in the summer it is brutal  It's it's so our summer is like y'all's winter  
**[0:09:04-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:09:04):**  It becomes very droughty  Right now we're at the worst drought that we've ever had and it's it's pretty bad. Oh, trust me John. I feel that I  Feel that I think everyone does  
**[0:09:17-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:09:17):**  So just just a few days ago  Back in mid-october the National Weather Service put out a graphic of the state of Kansas of how far behind  Everybody was on rain, you know, of course, you know  
**[0:09:29-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:09:29):**  The blue colors are you know, pretty close to normal or slightly above and the red is you know, anything red or orange is below  Probably  75% of the state was some form of red and there was a lot of  
**[0:09:44-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:09:44):**  Almost black on there and there's one spot on the map. That's that's minus  15.73 inches behind normal. Oh  That's right. That's where I'm at. So I posted that one of my friends from Flint Hills is like yeah  
**[0:09:58-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:09:58):**  I'm that dot that's minus 17.9  I said well, yeah, but you get like twice the rain that I normally get a hundred and fifty miles away. So  17 back for you  
**[0:10:12-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:10:12):**  It's bad. I get it, but it's probably not quite as bad as you know, almost 13 back for me  Mmm, so into to kind of help people understand, you know, I'm not too long ago  I posted videos of how bad the drought conditions were on tick-tock, you know, and it uh, I  
**[0:10:31-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:10:31):**  Would say, you know like in one of those videos I showed where  The water line would be as if that tank were full and this is at my place  The our lease place right by Schulenburg and so it's I mean it was a good 30 yards. Uh,  
**[0:10:48-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:10:48):**  receded I mean  Okay, we we got to deal with a little bit of vocabulary here  You're calling it you're saying tank and when you say tank, I think of a 16-foot fiberglass tank because that's mm-hmm  
**[0:11:00-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:11:00):**  That's my paradigm or I think of you know, a tank or some kind of fiberglass tank sitting on the ground or you know  That's lightly in  You're talking about a pond, correct?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:11:09):**  Yeah, that's that's a tank. That's that's kind of a Texas terminology for pond like, you know  What well a pond is smaller than a lake. So I you probably call it a pond  But yeah, we call it a tank. I mean, that's just kind of how I grew up here in it. So  
**[0:11:27-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:11:27):**  And my buddy from Arizona at Brecker, he corrected me. He educated me a few years ago  It's like no, that's a that's that's a tank. Like what are you talking about? That's a pond Edneys  No, that's a dirt tank. That's we call them dirt tanks, right? Okay, fine you Arizona weirdo again  
**[0:11:44-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:11:44):**  Yeah guys down in Southwest do stuff a little bit different so right  So drought drought planning you mentioned, you know your place in how it's bill when it's bad there  You've got some other property farther east that you can go to  
**[0:11:58-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:11:58):**  We could and and traditionally we have but  At those times when we have needed that property sometimes it would be during the middle of hurricane season and  That's probably less than ideal right? And so  
**[0:12:14-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:12:14):**  I would say there's been a few times where I've had to pack those cows up and haul them back. But I  Forget what the name of the hurricane was but  Because like usually  
**[0:12:27-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:12:27):**  Because both places in Anouac in how it's built  We go off of i-10 because the place in Anouac it's I don't know 15 minutes south  of  
**[0:12:40-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:12:40):**  i-10 and so  We just go on i-10 and go towards house or vice versa  But there would be hurricanes where you would have people from all over just stopped on i-10  
**[0:12:53-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:12:53):**  For hours and hours and hours not moving  Where they were in place like so the traffic wasn't moving or people were just stopped because they were well  The traffic just wasn't stopped like that. You'd have cars just lined up on i-10 trying to get out of  
**[0:13:08-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:13:08):**  the coast and  At one point the last time I did it me and my buddy my buddy helped me and so  What not like because normally that drive takes about three hours  
**[0:13:21-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:13:21):**  Five minutes and then you're like, okay  So we're going to drive for about six hours. Um  If I remember correctly that drive took us at least six hours  
**[0:13:33-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:13:33):**  And and so we had to go through back roads and all this crap and it i'm just like i'm not doing this again  So we don't have cattle down in Anouac anymore because of that  But and so now it's it's just hunting property and a financial resource  
**[0:13:51-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:13:51):**  Okay  So we're just kind of reminded of a of a hurricane that I had to ride through when I was in the navy in virginia  and  
**[0:14:01-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:14:01):**  You know generally would if you're assigned to a ship  And there's a storm coming you just leave because you're a lot you could run away at sea  I mean, right right you could you could generally run faster than a hurricane can catch you  
**[0:14:13-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:14:13):**  But our boat was in the shipyards so we weren't going anywhere. Oh, man. Yeah and  It ended up like the the main body of the storm was supposed to come right through where I lived and right through  You know right through Norfolk, Virginia beach area, right? So my buddy Richard he had a place out in the country  
**[0:14:31-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:14:31):**  About an hour away little town. I think it was called Dendron  And he was like, well, hey, it's not supposed to be bad out there. Just come out to Dendron. We'll ride the storm out  cool  
**[0:14:41-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:14:41):**  so we went out there and  Yeah, the storm decided it was going to shift its track a little bit farther to the left than they thought it would  And the eye came right over us and it turns out where I lived in Virginia beach  
**[0:14:54-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:14:54):**  barely got hit  So we had to ride out the worst of the storm  And you know, you've dealt with hurricanes. There's always trees down blocking roads power lines down  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:15:04):**  Yeah, we had to work for  pretty much a half a day  Just so we could get out of town  
**[0:15:12-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:15:12):**  And then it took us another half a day to make the hour and a half drive back to Virginia beach  So we first started going south and started running into closed roads and flooding. We're like, okay  Well, we'll just box around all this stuff, right? Yeah, that didn't work  
**[0:15:25-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:15:25):**  We ended up having to go all the way back to the north all the way back around Richmond  Yeah, um hurricane hurricane traffic patterns are not fun  It's a lot easier when they just call you up and like yep storm coming get on the boat. We're going  
**[0:15:38-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah, and that's when you just hope your car's still at the base when you get back that's for sure  Um, you know, I remember when harvey hit houston. It's  You had a a lot of people from louisiana in their airboats what they called them the occasion navy  
**[0:15:54-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:15:54):**  Came to help and help rescue teams and stuff like that. I mean you have cars all over underwater  I had  From at my parents house it uh water was inches from the door and some of it was flooding into the back door  
**[0:16:09-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:16:09):**  Into the back door, um, and we were sitting there with the shop vac  just hosing out water for hours and it uh  I didn't get much sleep those those few nights for sure  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:16:23):**  I could imagine  I could imagine  All right  
**[0:16:27-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:16:27):**  Moving on. Let's uh, let's circle back to beef masters. Let's talk about  beef master cattle and um, I guess start start with breed history and kind of end with why they're cool  Okay, uh, so  
**[0:16:40-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:16:40):**  Beef masters they were developed by tom lacer in 1931  He closed his herd in 1937 and then they became recognized in 1954  They were developed on six characteristics  
**[0:16:56-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:16:56):**  Which is weight confirmation hardiness milking ability fertility and disposition  and those are the kind of criteria I think that don't just apply to beef masters, but  Beefmasters, but I mean they can apply to any cattleman. Um,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:17:10):**  You know weight's important because that's what gets you paid  Uh confirmation you have to have a good sound animal with good feet and legs lots of muscle  um  
**[0:17:20-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:17:20):**  You know  Some of that's probably also consistency in the shape and size of the cuts. Correct. Yeah  I mean and the way tom lacer defined it was a type on the hook  
**[0:17:30-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:17:30):**  Um, you know, which I think is very applicable to commercial cattlemen in the seed stock business  um a lot of its visual appraisal, um because  What makes money in the seed stock business as well is based on how that animal looks people  
**[0:17:47-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:17:47):**  Want to be able to buy something what they like to look at  Um, and then you got hardiness, which you have to have an animal that can withhold  poor conditions  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:17:58):**  Um, you know, for example this drought my cattle are  they're not in  Perfect condition by any means but they're not in poor condition  
**[0:18:07-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:18:07):**  And you know, they my pastures look like golf greens except they're brown and dead  Um and then milking ability you have to have a cow that can that has a good sound utter  You know small teats for that calf to be able to nurse on its own  
**[0:18:22-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:18:22):**  Um, but she has to be able to convert that milk into pounds on that calf  Um, you know and fertility  Without that cow breeding we wouldn't be making money  
**[0:18:32-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:18:32):**  Um, you know, she has to be able to breed back with that calf inside, you know, too many people make excuses saying oh  You know, she's not bred back because she has that calf aside. Well  She's not making you money that's costing you money. Yeah, like take away  
**[0:18:47-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:18:47):**  All of our bullshit all of our fences, correct? All of our corrals all the ai  You know and and then what's what you know take away all the inputs and let's see what gets bred in  in someone else's commercial herd  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:19:00):**  And then the last one disposition  You don't want to be around cattle that are going to hurt you  I mean you have to have animal animals that are easy to work with  
**[0:19:09-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:19:09):**  Disposition also applies to carcass quality when they're sitting there running around high head and they're going to waste that marbling  And they're going to be yeah, that's an animal that's in higher stress, right? And when an animal is experiencing a state of high stress  They're not gaining weight  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:19:25):**  Correct  Correct  Um, and then so moving on, uh, the original genetic makeup of beef masters  
**[0:19:33-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:19:33):**  Is one half boss Taurus and one half bossa nichas the boss Taurus comes from herford and short horns  Um, well milking short horns specifically, okay  Um to kind of improve that utter quality and then the boss indicus, um, it was  
**[0:19:49-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:19:49):**  As kevin kind of called it the zebu cattle. I mean I  If you look like on wikipedia they say brahman, but it wasn't that simple they used  A lot of nalori jeer and goose rock cattle  
**[0:20:04-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:20:04):**  Um, and so that's kind of how it goes I feel like  Um, and so that's kind of how it goes. I feel like I feel like there's still some colonialism  In the breed names that are carrying over like  
**[0:20:19-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:20:19):**  Because you know a stupid european white people couldn't pronounce the african word for the breed  So they just made something up or mistranslated it and that got accepted into literature and into you know  And into our culture and I think we need to kind of maybe  
**[0:20:32-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:20:32):**  Unlearn some of that right? Yeah, and see i'm not gonna lie whenever I said jeer  I listened to kevin deluze podcast and that's how he pronounced it  So i'm gonna kind of go with that because he would know better than I would  
**[0:20:45-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:20:45):**  I would agree. I would agree. So  Um  But yeah, that's that's kind of the general makeup of of beef master cattle  
**[0:20:54-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:20:54):**  Uh for the first time ever i've been able to go to last year's cat, uh  Uh sale look at their herd. It was back in september and it was really cool experience  um  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:21:07):**  They had their highest turnaround of pregnancy rates  In a while and so I think they only had  20 not get bred back  
**[0:21:17-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:21:17):**  Um, they moved their cattle  in march give or take from uh,  Matheson, colorado down to falfuras  
**[0:21:25-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:21:25):**  Okay, so and they moved because of the drought that's why they're moving back down and so they it's pretty serious change in environment  And forage. Oh, it's yeah. I mean some of the cattle were breathing pretty heavily because they couldn't handle such such humidity  at first but  
**[0:21:42-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:21:42):**  Uh surprisingly they did really they were doing really well  Um, you know, but it was cool to see the the foundation hurting in the flesh for the first time  It was definitely one of my bucket list things, you know  
**[0:21:56-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:21:56):**  Yeah, that that definitely would be cool. Um, so I wrote a note down here, you know one of one of tom lasseter's  Uh, it was six points right six essentials. Yes, sir. One of them was milking ability  and so let's talk about that first for just a second and  
**[0:22:14-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:22:14):**  you know since  since the 50s 60s have came and gone and  Grain is cheap enough to feed to cows and steel and diesel are cheap enough to build these massive, you know feeding facilities  
**[0:22:27-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:22:27):**  I think that milking ability has gotten screwed up in in the modern commercial type cattle that are you know for that environment  right  Um, you know one of one of the eps that that's on a lot of you know, a lot of bull catalogs is milk production  
**[0:22:42-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:22:42):**  and you know, of course the holstein guys they want to focus on milk production and  I think there's a huge difference between a cow that's going to put out a hundred pounds of milk a day versus a cow  That's putting up 20 pounds of milk a day in the nutrient density  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:22:57):**  of that milk  and  like in my mind, you know  
**[0:23:04-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:23:04):**  We're talking about a breed that is developed back in the 20s and 30s and pretty much set  and  Back in the 20s and 30s. We didn't have the benefit of  
**[0:23:13-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:23:13):**  Sweet feeds cake distillers grains  You know, it was a lot lower energy feed back then and it was a lot  It was lower energy budget through the entire year  
**[0:23:26-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:23:26):**  So a cow that's going to exhibit excellent milking ability on a very energy limited diet like that  That tells me a couple things that cow can lay down enough body fat  She's she's exceeded her nutritional requirements that she's laying down significant fat deposits  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:23:44):**  because  You know it it needs to be said  An animal a mammal does not make milk directly from the food that it eats  
**[0:23:54-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:23:54):**  It has to eat the food. The food has to be stored as fat and then the milk is made from the fat cells  Right, so we have to have those fat deposits before we can have good high quality milk  So and it kind of goes like i'm working my way through the bondsman lectures book  
**[0:24:10-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:24:10):**  Right, if you if you're familiar with the book, it's a little dense  I'm not i'm not but i've i've wanted to figure out how I could get a hold of those  you know i'm saying because i've i've heard about bondsman a lot and i've definitely wanted to  
**[0:24:25-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:24:25):**  Understand his brain a little bit. Okay. I'll tell you where I got my copy of the book  in his brain a little bit. Okay. I'll tell you where I got my copy of the bondsman lecture papers  And i'll try to remember to get back to milking ability. I actually got my copy  
**[0:24:42-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:24:42):**  From steve campbell  Okay, and that was down at grass fed exchange. He had him down there for sale  And I bought a copy if you're looking for a copy of that bondsman book on amazon or a bookseller  
**[0:24:55-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:24:55):**  Be ready for three to five hundred bucks. Okay, it's so far out of print  I mean everything is super rare and you don't now in the last couple years since people have actually started hearing about the bondsman lectures  a lot  
**[0:25:08-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah, it's obviously in demand. So right  Um, they're out there  They're just they're just difficult to get and if you're really interested in trying to pick up a copy of those bondsman lecture papers  
**[0:25:19-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:25:19):**  I would suggest going to talk to steve campbell at tailormadecattle.com  And i'll try to put a link to that in the show notes, right?  But uh, so going back to milking ability, um  
**[0:25:34-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:25:34):**  The thing that I found very interesting about tom lacer's philosophy is  He was very he  Had a very regenerative mindset and so i've never heard the term regenerative agriculture until i've listened to you know  
**[0:25:52-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:25:52):**  Tik tok, you know and but as soon as that kind of light bulb went off in my head and i'm like  That's exactly what tom lacer was trying to preach whenever he constructed beef master cattle  Because he was very  
**[0:26:11-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:26:11):**  Emphasized on wanting to  See how he can develop cattle that excel with nature with what it provides nothing else  and so  
**[0:26:22-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:26:22):**  You know it that's again. That's why I say the six essentials that he provided  You know, I think that can be very applicable to not just beef master cattle, but anyone that has cattle  Sounds like he was really trying to promote breeding an animal  
**[0:26:38-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:26:38):**  That fits your environment, correct, correct  And uh, it's a kind of go ahead to kind of uh,  Understand understand that a little deeper  
**[0:26:49-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:26:49):**  Since we were talking about books. He they uh, the last year family. They have a book called  the lacer philosophy of cattle raising  And you can you can find that on amazon and you can find that uh on easel easel cattle company.com  
**[0:27:06-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:27:06):**  Which is one of the lacer herds  It'll be i'll put i'll find it. I'll make sure we get a link in the show notes  Um, it'll be i'll put i'll find it. I'll make sure we get a link in the show notes, right?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:27:17):**  Yeah. No, I just I think that book in that philosophy  Can only benefit anybody that had cattle. I mean it it doesn't just pertain to  beef masters  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:27:29):**  So right  I'm  I'm still hung up on milking ability. Mm-hmm  
**[0:27:35-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:27:35):**  and um, so one of the things that that my friend ed told me, um  My friend ed breaker was my men was he was a mentor a really good friend for several years  He had a ranch just up the just up the river  
**[0:27:47-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:27:47):**  Um, you know, i'd help him with management fencing burning type stuff and he'd help me a lot with cattle  And uh, so he he's the one that got me started on corrientes. Okay, and one of the things that ed  Ed always told me about  
**[0:28:03-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:28:03):**  Was he looked for the cows that had a real small bag?  But we're still raising a good calf, right?  And he always said that the milk that corriente makes  
**[0:28:15-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:28:15):**  Is way richer than a typical angus cow is going to make she's going to make a lot less  But it's going to be a whole lot richer  And you know that that kind of falls in with what we're talking about, you know  
**[0:28:28-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:28:28):**  Yeah, the cow's got to put lay down fat, but she only needs to lay down  just enough fat  So she can live through the winter and make enough milk for her calf. That's all her body's going to want to do, right and  
**[0:28:42-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:28:42):**  You know through selective breeding we find these good we find these, you know smaller frame cattle that are forage efficient in the pasture  That have great milking ability  You know, those are the ones that definitely need to be kept because they're providing, you know, that extra punch their calves  
**[0:28:57-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:28:57):**  All right. I agree 100 and so  One way that we are in the beef master breed, and I'm sure with a lot of other seed stock breeds as well  One way that we're able to determine that is ratios. So  
**[0:29:11-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:29:11):**  If you can find an animal that  Or if you can find a cow that consistently has calves that top their contemporary groups  That's the kind of cow that you need to have in your herd for sure  
**[0:29:21-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:29:21):**  Okay, unpack that a little bit like what what metrics are you using to measure that?  So  Uh  
**[0:29:29-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:29:29):**  The beef master breed they are they automatically calculate ratios. So when you have a contemporary group  Although you have to have calves that are born within a 60-day window. Okay, and so that  And it has to be from the producer themselves  
**[0:29:47-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:29:47):**  Like you can't buy a cow and have a calf inside and then bring it and that calf will not be in that contemporary group  It has to be produced on your ranch  and so  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:29:58):**  uh  You have  The mean ratio number is 100. That's the middle. Okay, and then so the the calves that perform  
**[0:30:08-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:08):**  The average they're going to be at or close to 100 the animals that  uh  outperform their contemporaries will ratio are you talking like strictly on a weight gain performance?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:21):**  weight  in scan data  and scrotal circumference with bulls  
**[0:30:26-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:26):**  um any kind of weights and measures is where  These contemporary groups are applied or the the ratios are applied  um  
**[0:30:35-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:35):**  and so  The better performing animals are so  It also it depends on how big the contemporary group is  
**[0:30:44-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:44):**  uh with the ratio window  but  The bigger the contemporary group and the better the animal performs the higher above 100 that ratio will score  
**[0:30:56-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:30:56):**  Now the poor the poor before performing animals will ratio under 100  so  Again, that mean average number is 100. Okay, and so the higher the performing animal goes  
**[0:31:09-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:31:09):**  The higher above 100 it goes and so obviously  Um, and that that ratio number will affect that animal's eps  Okay  
**[0:31:19-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:31:19):**  And so that's kind of how that works  Okay, and so if you can find and and so also in addition to those ratios  Um in the in the system it will show okay this animal ranked second out of 15 or first out of 15  
**[0:31:35-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:31:35):**  So that kind of helps you understand where that animal scored in that contemporary group  Okay, that makes that makes some sense, right  All right, where do we go now  
**[0:31:50-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:31:50):**  How do you feel about EPDs do you think that EPDs are  Are accurate measurement or you think they're just kind of an okay guideline? So  I do utilize EPDs in my herd but  
**[0:32:04-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:32:04):**  Um, so  The genetics that I use are from the cooperative that i'm involved with  Okay, and so I know a lot of people have skepticism on EPDs because they feel like oh people are lying about it. Well  
**[0:32:19-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:32:19):**  you can pick apart you can  Have a big assumption as to who those people are because the numbers seem incredibly unrealistic  But  
**[0:32:33-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:32:33):**  But  And especially if you're using your own genetics the EPDs will fall into place as to where they should  Um, you know and and again, it's not a tool. It's not or it's a tool. It's not the messiah. It's not  
**[0:32:50-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:32:50):**  The end-all beat-all. It's a tool don't single trait select for it single trait or select for a balanced animal  Because when you single trait select  You are going to sacrifice other important traits  
**[0:33:04-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:33:04):**  Um, so again just use it as a tool. Um, but from my experience EPDs  Have been pretty consistent with how the animal has performed but with EPDs you have EPD accuracies  Which is what you have to look at also, okay  
**[0:33:20-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:33:20):**  and  Um, I dna test my animals and that helps with the accuracy as well because you have uh, genomic enhanced EPDs  and uh, you know, it's again you have to  
**[0:33:34-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:33:34):**  if if you're new to  An association you have to figure out what program  To invest in initially and then from that point you either raise your own genetics or  
**[0:33:49-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:33:49):**  Keep yourself invested in that program to create consistency within your herd  Create consistency within your herd  Yeah, and I think I see a lot of guys either  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:34:03):**  I see a lot of guys just kind of not really  What what the hell am I trying to say here?  It seems like a lot of folks just want to take an easy way out and have an easy form  
**[0:34:12-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:34:12):**  It is and especially in the registered business. I've seen a lot of people  Come in with a lot of money  They don't want to do anything. They don't even want to fix their own fence  
**[0:34:21-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:34:21):**  They don't even want to manage their own cattle. They want to pay someone else to do it  They just want to show up at the meeting with the with the name on the shirt and the big black hat  It's to them. It's about shaking hands and making money, but if they don't do it properly, they're not going to make money  
**[0:34:37-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:34:37):**  They're going to lose money. And those are the kind of people that you'll see gone within five to ten years  But  You know, I feel like in the cattle business in general you have to earn your stripes  
**[0:34:51-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:34:51):**  You have to sit back. You have to learn you have to be mentored by someone initially  The cattle business is not a get rich quick scheme and too many people think it is  That try to come into it  
**[0:35:05-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:05):**  And it's incredibly unforgiving to slow learners  It is  And I mean and I think that the main factor is when someone tries to get into the cattle business  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:16):**  You have to love it and you have to have a passion for it  Because if you don't you won't last  I agree  
**[0:35:23-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:23):**  And I think that there's different  different avenues that that passion can take  You know, some people have a passion for a breed some people just have passion for cows  
**[0:35:33-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:33):**  Some people have a passion  To be on horseback all day and out in the sunshine, right?  And some people have passion to want to go out and just walk around the grass all day  
**[0:35:42-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:42):**  Right, it's finding the combinations of your passions  That make the light that can make your livestock operation and your lifestyle work  All right, I agree 100 on that  
**[0:35:54-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:35:54):**  You made a comment earlier that I'd like to circle back to while we're still, you know  reasonably close to the subject of breeds and breeding about  about breeding for looks versus performance  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:36:07):**  I believe they can go hand in hand because  Visual appraisal  Visual appraisal can  
**[0:36:16-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:36:16):**  It it can depend on how the animal performs if you have again you have to animal that's easy fleshing  If that animal is not easy fleshing, they're going to fall apart. And so you have to look for that. It's not something  that can be  
**[0:36:32-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:36:32):**  I don't know. It's it's not a numerical value  Um, it's a visual appraisal. Um, and again, you have to look for an animal that has good feet and legs  um  
**[0:36:43-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:36:43):**  You know you have to animal that that structurally sound, you know, good top good hip  Hip on them, uh, lots of muscle behind them. You have to they have to be wide from behind when you look at them  um  
**[0:36:55-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:36:55):**  You know  And you have in your cows need to look like cows and your bulls need to look like bulls  Otherwise, there's going to be a hormonal or hormone imbalance  
**[0:37:07-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:37:07):**  Yeah, I I agree like the  It no other place do we want things to all look the same, you know  a square box the boys to look like girls the girls to look like boys other than in the show ring with um,  
**[0:37:19-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:37:19):**  Yeah with some types of cattle and I I think you know, I  I go back to you know, what bondsman says what steve campbell translates and what he says  You know the bull needs to look like it's walking uphill on level ground, right?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:37:33):**  You know big neck big shoulders good guts  Good guts, you know medium waist decent, but your cows you want your you know  decent neck small shoulders  
**[0:37:45-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:37:45):**  Big guts big butt good udder and you want her to look like she's walking downhill on level ground exactly. Yeah  um, you know a lot of your power and and you get from the bull and a lot of your  Kind of more eye appealing, uh feminine traits you get from the cow and that's you know  
**[0:38:04-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:38:04):**  You know that kind of creates a balance when you cross those two together  When you say that bull's got a lot of power  What do you mean?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:38:13):**  uh  A lot of muscle mostly mainly a lot of muscle just a lot of natural thickness  Um, you know wide wide and widespread rib  
**[0:38:24-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:38:24):**  um  You know and  I don't know how to explain it better. But uh, I mean muscle goes a lot of a long ways with power  
**[0:38:36-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:38:36):**  You want to see something that just looks like it's jacked just yeah on top of muscle or  yeah, you want so you don't want to go overboard with it because  When you have an animal that's too extreme in one direction, it's going to sacrifice other traits  
**[0:38:50-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:38:50):**  So if you have it, it's if you look at a bodybuilder, he has a hard time walking around  And so if a lot of them don't know how to stretch right well  So if you have an animal that has too much muscle, they're going to be short-strided  
**[0:39:04-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:39:04):**  They're going to they're not going to walk like an a like an athlete  Okay, and you want the best way you want to put it  Is you want a cow to walk like an athlete? It's got to have  
**[0:39:14-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:39:14):**  flexibility to it because it's it's gonna  It's not going to be easy for them when they're walking on on long on long terrains, you know  big pastures  
**[0:39:26-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:39:26):**  Yeah, you can see my my stuff's not exactly flat, you know  I've I've got to have some athletic cattle that can travel hills and you know that that are that are pretty mobile, right?  Um, so  
**[0:39:40-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:39:40):**  We're still trying to talk about beef masters here. Um  So tom laster came up, you know with the breed philosophy and you know, it does very much sound like  What we're calling regenerative agriculture now, uh-huh and  
**[0:39:54-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:39:54):**  You know just doing some more thinking about that the time frame that he developed it all these modern inputs weren't available  They were not no  And I think we're we're entering an era where the modern inputs are going to become  
**[0:40:07-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:40:07):**  I think they'll still be available  I just think they're just going to keep going up and up and up in price rapidly, you know faster than we can  faster than we can increase our revenue to buy sure sure and I think that  
**[0:40:19-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:40:19):**  And I think that I I really feel that you know  We need to be moving back towards what the beef masters are with every breed of cattle, you know something that's  You know, we need to be looking at these animals that are going to do better on the resources we have  
**[0:40:33-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:40:33):**  Right that are going to raise a good calf that we're not going to have to use use a lot of inputs in so I agree  that being said  What what are what are some of the better beef master crosses you've ever come across  
**[0:40:47-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:40:47):**  And what are some that don't work if you've ever seen any you're talking about like beef master cross with other breeds or cross breeds  Yeah, beef master with brangus or beef master with you know  I think it all depends on your region but  
**[0:41:01-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:01):**  Based on what i've seen beef masters with angus do really well  Because I mean angus obviously are in such high demand in the throughout the commercial industry  Commercial industry um beef masters cross with charlays because they really put the pounds on they really put the pounds on they do well  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:22):**  A lot of  Sale barns are familiar with charlay because of that yellow color  Um, and you know angus and charlay do really well  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:31):**  um  I really like red angus  Um, you know, especially like if you're in more south regions where it's hotter  
**[0:41:38-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:38):**  I think those do well because uh  A lot of black cattle are underneath those trees while the more lighter colored cattle are out working  Your beef masters stay out working all day in the texas heat or they go shade up all day  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:53):**  They work all day now. I mean occasionally you'll see them underneath the tree, but that's with any animal  um  but they uh  
**[0:41:59-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:41:59):**  They're out working  When a lot of cattle are resting underneath the tree, that's for sure or standing in the creek or standing in the tank  Yeah, so I got I have a jersey nurse cow  
**[0:42:12-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:42:12):**  um  and she will be  Almost head deep into that pond while the you know, my other beef master cows are  
**[0:42:20-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:42:20):**  Are out working or she'll be underneath the tree  She looks like she I mean she'll have her tongue sticking out panting like she's about to die  Okay, the beef masters. You just sit there in the top of the hill and in the hot wind blazing sun  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:42:32):**  Just having a good old time, right?  I  I would definitely back that up the last two years  
**[0:42:38-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:42:38):**  I've co-mingled my corrientes with uh with some angus and some herfords and you know  that type cross  And it's really interesting that the first warm days we get coming into you know, after they show up coming in, you know late may and june  
**[0:42:52-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:42:52):**  At corrientes they stay out. They stay out hustling work all day and those black cows. They just yeah  They head for the water they head for the shade  Man, I think that uh corriente cattle especially are kind of under appreciated price wise  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:07):**  I think that they they create a good solid foundation maternally  Of course, they don't do the best on across the scale  but  
**[0:43:16-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:16):**  I think they're a great  Man, I'll send you a picture of some ribeyes  Some ones we just got back from the plant really. Yeah. Yeah  
**[0:43:25-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:25):**  I mean, no, you know, it's it's one of those things where you kind of have to bypass the sale barn and feedlot with with  those  100 percent  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:35):**  Um  I don't know. It's  And I and i'm kind of getting to that point to where like my bull my bull calves that  
**[0:43:42-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:42):**  Won't make make the cut, you know, i'm i'm trying i'm wanting to figure out a way to  Start up a producer to consumer type business  On the side, you know, that's you know, i'm gonna probably start really small couple calves here and there to kind of get a feel for it  
**[0:43:58-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:43:58):**  but  I want to bypass the feedlot and you know packers and sale barns  Very cool it you know, even if it's just not even  
**[0:44:12-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:44:12):**  Not even four or five animals a year  That can still be a very significant bump on a ranch's bottom line just direct marketing even five head  Yeah, yeah  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:44:22):**  I've uh, let's see i've heard of people  that had  That had some steer calves  
**[0:44:30-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:44:30):**  I mean they  Grows somewhere close to four thousand dollars off of a steer  Which is incredible compared to you know, six to eight hundred bucks across the scale at the sale barn  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:44:41):**  Across the scale at sale barn  Uh, I don't have a copy in front of me  but just for grins  
**[0:44:50-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:44:50):**  And i'll try to remember put a link in the show notes to the usda grass fed beef report  They only put it out about once a month  Then the last one I saw was I printed at the end of august I think  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:03):**  And it came out the beginning of august  right  uh  
**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:08):**  the court if you believe the usda numbers and  There there's guys selling  pasture-finished  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:15):**  grass-fed  halves  For six bucks on the rail six bucks a pound on on the rail  
**[0:45:23-0:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:23):**  That's about that sounds about right. Uh  Grass fed ground beef  National average I think was 850 a pound on that report. That's good  
**[0:45:35-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:35):**  Rib-eyes  40 a pound sirloins were 35 a pound. Wow. That's that's approaching  American wagyu prices  
**[0:45:47-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:45:47):**  Yeah, I mean if you're in the right market  I mean, yeah 40 dollars a pound for ribeye sign me up for that right all day all day  Sign me up but uh, you know the market  
**[0:46:03-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:46:03):**  It's there. I think the market is there  The price is there to support what we're doing. I mean for the economics in october of 22  I mean november might be completely different  
**[0:46:15-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:46:15):**  But you know currently I think the economics make a really really strong case  To grass finish animals, right? Right, and I think  I think that price elevation a lot of that goes into trust because people trust what  
**[0:46:29-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:46:29):**  Because people trust what what the producers are doing they can you know a producer can take a picture of an animal saying this is what?  You're getting  Yeah, you can't you can't say the same thing for commercial  
**[0:46:42-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:46:42):**  beef at the store  Yeah, 100 and that's that's something i've been talking about for a long time is is transparent traceability in the food system in the food supply  and there was um  
**[0:46:56-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:46:56):**  Well, there's one a guy on tik tok, wyoming rancher. His name is drew pear person pearson. Okay. I hope I said that right  You probably it's probably pearson. Yeah, one of them is probably wrong and like it's an email whatever  Anyway, drew's a really cool guy. We had him on  
**[0:47:12-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:47:12):**  Gosh, I want to say it was back like episode 15 or 17 or something. Okay, and he's got a really cool program called beef chain  and  Uh, basically you take your eid numbers  
**[0:47:24-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:47:24):**  Right you send them to them and they start tracking them on the blockchain  and like eventually the goal would be  That you know when my calves are born or the first time they're working to get entered into my system  
**[0:47:37-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:47:37):**  Those numbers go off and they get tracked it they get tracked on on beef chain  And pretty much nothing would happen again until I processed it  And then when I process it or have that animal processed then a qr code  
**[0:47:52-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:47:52):**  Goes on each one of those packages  Okay, and that qr code  Traces black back to that blockchain record  
**[0:48:01-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:01):**  And boy beef chain is set up. I would have control over who gets to see what parts of that data  That's interesting. So if I put in if I put in that data record, you know  birthday way day  
**[0:48:14-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:14):**  When we worked them when we put the tags in when we did the vaccines when we cut, you know and waits at different dates  And waits at different dates  All that gets attached to that animal's permanent record  
**[0:48:25-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:25):**  On the blockchain and it can't be changed and if it does get changed  There's a record of the change and who changed it has to sign, you know that that was changed  Wow  
**[0:48:35-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:35):**  Um, and then that data  You know as long as there's a uh chain of custody  That keeps that meat tied to that record  
**[0:48:44-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:44):**  You know that can go all the way to the end consumer. So they've actually done this  um  With some with some beef that they shipped over to I believe Taiwan and Japan  
**[0:48:56-0:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:48:56):**  That when they like when the when they serve the meat at a restaurant  They bring out a qr. They bring out a card with a qr code on it  And the consumer can scan that qr code and look at every day all the data they want about about that animal where it was from  
**[0:49:12-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:49:12):**  How it was raised when it was born when it was slaughtered what it weighed and if it had any any medications  Wow  Yeah, that's cool  
**[0:49:22-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:49:22):**  So I and I think that's a direction  You know  I guess we can have a conversation about you know eids and mandatory tracing and traceability  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:49:32):**  now  right  We're sitting here talking about eids and tracking shit on blockchain. Okay?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:49:38):**  That's one thing the government telling me you have to put eids on your cows and you have to give us the numbers  Now we've got a problem right i'm i'm not a fan of someone telling me what I can and can't do with my kettle  Or just telling us you have to you have to put these buttons in all your cows  
**[0:49:57-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:49:57):**  You don't have to give us the numbers but you have to have this this identification on your animals, right?  I i'm not even sure I like that either  um  
**[0:50:07-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:50:07):**  But you know the fact is  There's a lot of technology that exists that can benefit us in a lot of different ways  If we choose to use it, but there are always you know, there's always risks that come with technology  
**[0:50:22-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:50:22):**  I agree  So, um, I gotta pay a bill real quick. So we'll be right back in about 60 seconds.

**[0:51:44-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:51:44):**  so  We were talking earlier the the beef masters were  We're probably maybe originally one of the first  
**[0:51:55-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:51:55):**  breeds developed along some of the regenerative agriculture principles  So  You know, I and obviously it really seems like we got away from that as an industry  
**[0:52:08-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:52:08):**  As the whole of the industry we really got away from that. Mm-hmm, you know as we kind of got into the 50s and 60s  Um  So have you what what changes have you made recently to move back to a more regenerative?  
**[0:52:23-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:52:23):**  type of ranching  well, I'm still in the process of one of trying to make those changes, but uh, I  Would I definitely need to kind of  
**[0:52:39-0:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:52:39):**  Restructure my  Like I need I need to develop more cross fencing to do rotational grazing  I'm not at that point yet, but I'm that's definitely one of the changes that I'm wanting to make  
**[0:52:54-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:52:54):**  You know like we've we've  You know the past couple years we've done weed killing but that's not regenerative. So  What I'm trying to figure out is how you can get  
**[0:53:05-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:53:05):**  a better control of certain undesirable weeds within that past year  So that's an undesirable weed  Well, like because we got broom weed like that's that's choking out some of my grass  
**[0:53:18-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:53:18):**  And so I don't know how to kind of get a handle on that  because I mean and so we have I have a  Regenerative friend that lives down the road for me  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:53:30):**  and  You know because I'd ask him that same thing he said that you know spraying  Saltwater along those pastures  
**[0:53:39-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:53:39):**  Spraying liquid molasses and so that would kind of create more of a pellet ability standpoint  to eat the some of those undesirable things, but I also got I  also have weeds that have a lot of stick burrs and cock burrs which  
**[0:53:57-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:53:57):**  Like to eat that stuff right and so how do I get a handle on that? You know I'm saying and  So that's that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out how I can get a better handle on that  Part of me part of me kind of wants to say that you know things like yellow stickers and a couple burrs and  
**[0:54:16-0:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:54:16):**  the broom weeds  Are a sign of poor health?  Right, I'm not don't take that as an attack. No. No, I mean it's it's it's it's just the way it is  
**[0:54:27-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:54:27):**  But that also means that the only way you go like the direction is up. Yeah, and  I  I still have cock burrs. I still have stickers in the pasture. You know like there's there's places that are undesirable right and  
**[0:54:45-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:54:45):**  You can choose to look at it as a problem yeah, or you can choose to not look at it  Yeah, I mean  One of the little Cowboys that worked for my dad back in the late 80s and early 90s  
**[0:54:59-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:54:59):**  There is a like there was a washout by a fence or some erosion or something and  one day dad was getting really upset about it and get kind of keyed up and  He was he was wanting to fix it wanting to know what to do and you know  
**[0:55:12-0:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:55:12):**  Just had like a 65 horsepower Massey Ferguson tractor with a front-end loader on it like  You're not gonna go do a bunch of dirt work with that thing  That's not the right tool for the job right and he couldn't figure out how to fix it  
**[0:55:24-0:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:55:24):**  you know and he kept talking about kept talking about and  Eventually, I haven't just said well if it bothers you just so damn much. Why do you keep going over there and looking at it?  Yeah  
**[0:55:36-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:55:36):**  Fair point, but it's sometimes that's easier said and done though  Yes  Yes, you know very much so  
**[0:55:44-0:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:55:44):**  But going back to our practices we've always in the winter we've always  Drilled oats. Well, I say drilled and it initially we we would disc it and then drill it  And then  
**[0:56:02-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:56:02):**  That we didn't like messing with the the grand drill that much so we would disc it  Spread it and then discover it again to kind of cover it. Okay, but  That's in so I made a comment the other day on  
**[0:56:18-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:56:18):**  Tik-tok where I said some of our some of the things that we're doing is costing us money and that's one of those things  I do believe that  Putting down notes is a good thing because it cuts back on feet or feeding. Hey  
**[0:56:30-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:56:30):**  For sure. So I think in the thin and the method I think that would work that would kind of  be  regenerative related is  
**[0:56:41-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:56:41):**  to just  No-till drill it  You know and I have a buddy that doesn't he does really well with it  
**[0:56:47-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:56:47):**  So I think that would be a regenerative approach to what I've been doing  And I think that's a good thing  I think that would be a regenerative approach to what I've been doing  
**[0:57:03-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:57:03):**  You know, and so that's that's kind of what I have in mind at the moment, but I'm completely new to the whole  regenerative  Philosophy and so I'm definitely wanting to learn more about it for sure  
**[0:57:18-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:57:18):**  Well, like we were like we talked earlier about  You know your forage on most of your ranches is good in the fall and in the spring, right?  so  
**[0:57:29-0:57:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:57:29):**  Now hear me out  If we you know, turn back the clock  1700 1800 whatever when there's still plenty of Buffalo roaming around right? What if  
**[0:57:42-0:57:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:57:42):**  Like in the fall in the winter time, they were down around your part of the world  Right because you got good forage like the grass has you know, there's good punch. There's good green grass  Yeah, and then as you go through the you know  
**[0:57:54-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:57:54):**  The fall and the winter and you start rolling into spring they start running out of grass down south  And they just chase the green up all the way north through the plains end up in canada in the summer  And when it starts running out of grass and gets cold in canada  
**[0:58:08-0:58:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:58:08):**  The whole buffalo herd goes back to texas and eats everything back and forth along the whole way, right?  And that would really make sense like for my forage availability and like my forage  You know when I have forage and when I have protein in the grass, right? So  
**[0:58:25-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:58:25):**  Like my grass is going to start coming in like I can have cool seasons  In march if i've got rain and temperature most often I won't get much until probably mid april  Mid to late april by the time the soil temperature gets up enough and i've had some moisture  
**[0:58:39-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:58:39):**  That's when my cool season wakes up  Three to four weeks later the warm season wakes up  A couple weeks after that's when the cool season quits. So i've got i've got great protein  
**[0:58:51-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:58:51):**  and forage availability from  That was my phone. I've got great protein and forage availability from about may 1st to about  Into july  
**[0:59:04-0:59:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:04):**  You know sometimes early july sometimes late july  And sometimes that can even stretch all the way down into september just kind of depends on the year we've had  Right, but then there's a point where we get to the heat of the summer  
**[0:59:15-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:15):**  My warm season grasses shut off  You know, they go into they go into root reserve and stem and seed head  And they shut off and we just fall off this cliff of nutrition like the protein just kind of disappears suddenly  
**[0:59:29-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:29):**  That happened like two months ago right because it's so freaking dry and  And  Now  
**[0:59:38-0:59:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:38):**  We're just kind of coast on stockpile, but then  In a year where we'd get rain  I would have a protein bump  
**[0:59:46-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:46):**  in november december  That would last till about mid january  Maybe beginning of january when it gets really cold and the weather starts coming in  
**[0:59:56-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=0:59:56):**  um  I was kind of counting on that winter pro that that late fall protein bump last year. Yeah, I didn't get it  Well because of the lack of rain. Yeah, i'm not getting it this year because because uh, because like we  
**[1:00:09-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:00:09):**  Was it we we put out oats?  And it didn't do no we put out ryegrass because we because we  were bailing for our neighbors a lot and that kind of  
**[1:00:20-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:00:20):**  You know interfered with our schedule and plant notes. So we just spread out ryegrass  And uh that didn't come on with a crab  and so  
**[1:00:30-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:00:30):**  uh, and I and you know, I blame it on the rain, but I mean ryegrass by itself  I don't like planting because it's so stringy and small like it's not a broadleaf at all  um  
**[1:00:41-1:00:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:00:41):**  That'll do I mean  It's a good grazing crop though, right?  Well, I mean like because the way we do it is uh, we'd put oats and ryegrass like I wouldn't put ryegrass by itself  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:00:53):**  um  You know, so  we would put oats and ryegrass together usually but uh  
**[1:01:01-1:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:01):**  Again, because you know, we got caught up cutting hay, you know for our neighbors and stuff like that. That's uh,  Kind of what how it played out last year, but usually every year  Especially when we get some rain  
**[1:01:14-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:14):**  Those oats improved a lot. They helped they helped drastically in terms of feeding hay or not feeding. Hey, you know  Yeah, yeah  Kind of on this same line  
**[1:01:26-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:26):**  so i've got the  Let's just call it right around 7 000 acres of native range. Okay on the ranch. There was uh,  From what I can tell on the on google satellite images  
**[1:01:38-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:38):**  Like I can find about five hundred and sixty to five hundred and eighty acres that were farmed at one point  According to the fsa office. There is only  340  
**[1:01:49-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:49):**  Okay  so somewhere between  350 and 600 odd acres of farm ground were ever that were all on this ranch  
**[1:01:58-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:01:58):**  Because that's pretty much all that was flat enough to to be farmed  right and  You know the question keeps coming up to me, you know other people ask my wife asks and of course I ask myself  
**[1:02:13-1:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:02:13):**  Okay, so there is a couple hundred acres that are flat enough I could drag drag a tool across it with a tractor  Mm-hmm  Dad planted that stuff back the last of it back to grass in 1985  
**[1:02:27-1:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:02:27):**  Okay  and  It took it wasn't until probably  
**[1:02:33-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:02:33):**  2004 2005  That we're really successful getting the forbs and the tall grass  re-established in those areas  
**[1:02:43-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:02:43):**  And I I get really hesitant to think about you know  Hooking up to a tractor and a big drill  To go drag something into the dirt  
**[1:02:53-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:02:53):**  You know go drag in cover crop seed at twenty dollars an acre  Man, that's an awful big gamble  It is it is a gamble awful big gamble for a guy like me that's trying to operate on you know  
**[1:03:06-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:03:06):**  Without any without machinery like that, you know, I don't know that shit. I'd have to go i'd have to go rent that power  and  It just seems like that's a that's a that's a lot of expense, but I can see where you know  
**[1:03:18-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:03:18):**  It I I could definitely see a use case scenario for it  Now i'm not saying that i'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm saying that  If I had farm ground that was still being farmed today  
**[1:03:30-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:03:30):**  Like literally the guy across the fence  Who's uh, they farm wheat a lot of wheat around here, especially on the tops where my farm ground is  And it's probably it's just as bad as you think it is  
**[1:03:41-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:03:41):**  Mm-hmm, you know  A week after they cut the wheat they're running the disc through it. It gets this two or three times. Maybe a spray  Then a field cultivator and they're planting it right now. So it's all right, you know  
**[1:03:54-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:03:54):**  It's it's less worse than six-month fallow corn, but it's still you know, two three four-month fallow  fallow field  for wheat  
**[1:04:04-1:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:04:04):**  I don't know if I had a wheat field that was surrounded by pasture. Mm-hmm  I'd be putting in some i'd i'd be transitioned trying to transition that to no-till  Right i'd be putting in native grasses  
**[1:04:19-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:04:19):**  I mean I get native grass seed is probably some of the most expensive shit you can buy on the planet  Okay, and so it's like when you say native grass seed is that like to that region or just  Like what would go into that native seed?  
**[1:04:34-1:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:04:34):**  For me  I mean there'd be some cool seeds I'd put in but primarily I'd want to make sure I had some warm season  You know native warm season grasses big blue stem little blue stem  
**[1:04:44-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:04:44):**  Switchgrass Indian grass, um, and maybe even some cytos drama. Uh-huh and you know I  I I I  I didn't do my research so i'm not not really prepared to talk about grass seed blends, but um  
**[1:04:57-1:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:04:57):**  I would look for a blend  That's that's that's representative of what should be in your area now  That being said  
**[1:05:08-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:05:08):**  Two percent of the original native range is left  You know up and down the great plains and I feel very fortunate that I have  I've got a chunk of that  
**[1:05:18-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:05:18):**  You know, I've got the vast majority of this ranch has never been converted  From grassland to anything else  So there's 98 of it that's gone right and  
**[1:05:32-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:05:32):**  You know  I'm gonna assume that you're on like  where you're at was completely farmed up ripped up and  
**[1:05:39-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:05:39):**  Improved grasses were planted or something non-native is there and it's it's mostly a monoculture  so  The 46 acres, uh that we own  
**[1:05:50-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:05:50):**  My dad planted uh coastal  At some point, you know, uh, which which I mean is still pretty much there  Um a lot a lot  
**[1:06:04-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:06:04):**  Of my area has a lot of bermuda grasses  You know, we we haven't really touched  Our lease place with different grasses or anything like that all we would except for the oats  
**[1:06:17-1:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:06:17):**  During the winter, but that's about it. Um  As far as a warm season grasses, i'm not sure what specifically but I do know it's bermuda grasses  Um, and i'm not sure if that I I mean I don't think that's native I mean because bermuda grass isn't native to texas  
**[1:06:34-1:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:06:34):**  I don't think  Um, I don't I don't think it is either right but what i'm getting at is you know, no matter  but what i'm getting at is you know, no matter no matter what your land base looks like now or what  
**[1:06:49-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:06:49):**  Few species of grass are on it or could be on it, right?  I think that you know that all of us in the plains  Well, even you know in the mountains or you know in the east  
**[1:07:02-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:07:02):**  right  We need to be looking at transitioning back away from these quote improved pastures or improved grasses  that require inputs  
**[1:07:11-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:07:11):**  Back to something that's more native that doesn't require inputs, right?  But the the trick is is how do you get there? Like you don't just take a farm field that you know has been growing wheat  Wheat on a summer fallow rotation for the last 80 years  
**[1:07:27-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:07:27):**  You're not just going to go drill in native range seed and something's going to come up next year  I could tell you that ain't going to happen like that. That would be a pipe dream  so maybe the thing we need to look at is like a pasture cropping transition to where  
**[1:07:43-1:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:07:43):**  you know, we take this pasture and  Maybe the first year we do like a soil we no till in a soil health blend  like turnip radishes things that'll fix nitrogen and other  
**[1:07:56-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:07:56):**  others in the soil  Then we come in  You know, and maybe there's some native seeds  
**[1:08:02-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:08:02):**  Mixed in there, you know warm season cool season grasses  Then the next time you come in  You no till in something else, you know till in like, you know an oats or a rye or a wheat  
**[1:08:13-1:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:08:13):**  Just something that's going to come up just something that's going to grow some more living roots to provide forage for the cows  Because it may take it, you know, it probably it may take a year two three four  To establish a seed bank to where it will start  
**[1:08:28-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:08:28):**  Regent where the seed bank can regenerate the plants and the plants you see come up every year are coming from the seed bank  And they're what will grow that year based on available soil nutrients and available rainfall, right?  But what does that look like  
**[1:08:47-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:08:47):**  Yeah  I mean, I would like to know that for sure. I mean  um  
**[1:08:52-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:08:52):**  You know, I I don't know I want to do I mean  I mean the the thing about regenerative agriculture that that kind of fascinate fascinates me is obviously  the saving  
**[1:09:02-1:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:02):**  money in your pocket  um, and then also  Uh, you know kind of kind of helping the land and I mean at that point vegans don't have an argument  
**[1:09:16-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:16):**  You know  Ah  Well, that's a can of worms it is I it is  
**[1:09:24-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:24):**  It is  Okay, are the vegans, right?  To say it depends on what it is  
**[1:09:33-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:33):**  um  I guess when you look at their ant when 30 000 foot view their argument that animal agriculture is destroying the planet  Uh  
**[1:09:48-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:48):**  I mean for my I mean, I I don't know the exact number but in terms of carbon footprint methane gas isn't  nearly as detrimental  as  
**[1:09:59-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:09:59):**  uh carbon footprint from vehicles  And things like that. So I mean  I I would agree with that and I guess  
**[1:10:08-1:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:10:08):**  I I wasn't necessarily trying to  Trying to trap you into saying anything at all, right? No, no, no, I know  No, no, no, no, uh, and I think I think I think a lot of the vegan arguments are extremely superficial  
**[1:10:21-1:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:10:21):**  and  But then again, I think they also have some extremely strong arguments  Because they're viewing life through the lens a very narrow lens of what they see through their activists  
**[1:10:36-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:10:36):**  and organizations like pita and and very  cherry-picked  media  
**[1:10:43-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:10:43):**  you know  and  I'm sure there's some confirmation bias going on there. We're all guilty of it  
**[1:10:49-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:10:49):**  I'm, not going to pretend that i'm not guilty of suffering from confirmation bias every once in a while  And  I I guess there's a little bit of that, you know right here on our side because  
**[1:11:00-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:00):**  You know, we have a tendency to view the world from our own narrow lens  sure, and you know  the way the  
**[1:11:08-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:08):**  my paradigm is  Like vegans wouldn't have a vegans should not have any sort of a problem with anything i'm doing out here  right  
**[1:11:17-1:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:17):**  and  Right wrong or indifferent. That's that i'm not doing business practices. Just keep vegans happy. Like let's be clear on that  I do things the way I do them because I think it's the right way, right now  
**[1:11:31-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:31):**  when you have some of them saying that you know conditions in  When hog houses are horrible or you know having to euthanize an entire barn of 10 000 hogs and the way they did that  Was horrible, right that shit is indefensible  
**[1:11:47-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:47):**  right  You know the 10 000 head of cattle that died in the kansas feed lots back in the summer due to the heat bulge overnight  That shit is indefensible  
**[1:11:59-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:11:59):**  And that's why the vegans have an argument  Right, that's why people are listening to the vegans is because we collectively in the beef industry in agriculture  We do shit that is indefensible, right?  
**[1:12:12-1:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:12:12):**  And um, but I do I do think that on our side  you know  While they try to make an argument they don't you know, for example the way temple grandin developed  
**[1:12:24-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:12:24):**  uh working systems for cattle the way that she developed a  Uh system to process them  um  
**[1:12:31-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:12:31):**  You know, I they don't have an argument. I mean because because I I did a tik tok video the other day of where  Uh, peter tried to make a video on an animal getting stunned  And it blew up. I ain't gonna I mean it got like what 1.4 million views  
**[1:12:48-1:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:12:48):**  I think it's kind of blown up in their faces. Honestly, it did it did I mean like because in that video  Because in that video, there's nothing wrong that I see it was it's quick humane  Okay, well and what's the alternative pita?  
**[1:13:01-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:13:01):**  Let them die of old age in a pasture  That's not only hurting themselves, but the environment as well. I mean, that's not humane. No, it's not  You know the most humane  
**[1:13:12-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:13:12):**  The most humane way is is a bolt gun and we're talking about harvesting animals, right?  Right, right. I agree 100 and to that extent. Um  I had uh had dinner with some friends last night and this was a this was one of the topics that kept coming up in conversation  
**[1:13:30-1:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:13:30):**  is  Ethical slaughter  How do we you know, how do we provide ethical slaughter to the to the most amount of people as possible?  
**[1:13:40-1:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:13:40):**  And you know, we're talking about you know  Great. We're just kind of throwing a lot of ideas around we're talking about mobile slaughter units again and you know going around and you know  a group having one and contracting around or you know having various fractional ownership interests where  
**[1:13:53-1:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:13:53):**  You know producers would have a fractional ownership interest in a mobile plant the mobile plant would  come to your ranch and you just lead the cow up or you know, call them into a little pen and  One second they're eating grass and pasture on the sun on their back and the next they're on a one-way trip to freezer camp  
**[1:14:09-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:14:09):**  right  right  I'd love to see us get a lot closer to that model and and lower stress on the animal because  
**[1:14:19-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:14:19):**  We owe it to our animals  to give them  Absolutely with with ultimate respect even up to and  
**[1:14:29-1:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:14:29):**  Slightly past their final moments alive  I agree 100  I think they call me a little weird, but when I uh, when I drop them off at the plant  
**[1:14:40-1:14:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:14:40):**  I say goodbye to each one of them and I thank each one of them as they come off the trailer  Mm-hmm  I do too  
**[1:14:48-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:14:48):**  Like because we had  Off that jersey nurse cow that I mentioned earlier. We had a beef master jersey cross steer and you know, I took him to the packer and  You know, I it's uh  
**[1:15:00-1:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:15:00):**  It makes you think a little bit, you know and and appreciate what they have to contribute to you  It's a different trip than when you're just taking one to the barn  Right, and you know the guy that buys her at the barn is just going to send her right to the plant  
**[1:15:14-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:15:14):**  I mean, it's a it's a different trip when you take her yourself  It is  It is  
**[1:15:21-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:15:21):**  Now I something that people ought to experience a little more often I suppose  But so kind of continuing down this path, you know that  Is some of the some of the practices that vegans get upset about you know, like hormones in the meat  
**[1:15:37-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:15:37):**  Okay, I get that yeah, I totally get that  I also totally get why backgrounders and feedlots will use hormones  Right. I mean you take the nuts off your boys. There's no sex hormones in there  
**[1:15:52-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:15:52):**  Right, they need to be replaced. Okay, but why are we pumping them full of estrogen?  Why are we pumping them full of basically sex change hormones?  Why not just keep it there if that's what the case if that's what you're trying to get back?  
**[1:16:07-1:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:16:07):**  Yeah, you know  Why why why do we have to mix testosterone with estrogen?  To inject our castrated male cattle with why don't we just do testosterone?  
**[1:16:18-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:16:18):**  Okay, I get it. It's a meat quality thing because you know like we were talking about earlier  The bulls need to look like boys and the cows need to look like girls and what's the difference there?  Okay, we want to we want our boys to be big chiseled muscle  
**[1:16:33-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:16:33):**  You don't want that chiseled muscle on the cow you want nice soft rounded curves, right? Right?  Testosterone puts up that hard lean muscle  Estrogen puts up that fluffy soft muscle right? So I okay I get it. That's why we got to use  
**[1:16:49-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:16:49):**  That's why we're injecting  steers with estrogen  to  
**[1:16:55-1:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:16:55):**  Get them to make that that softer fluffier muscle that's more rounded more curved for tenderness  But is it though?  Probably not but I mean it's not that it's not that it's not that it's not that it's not that it's not that it's not that  
**[1:17:10-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:17:10):**  Probably not but I mean, I assume that's their goal  Okay, you know tenderness  I you know, I catch all kinds of hell for my cattle. Oh, those are long horns will taste like a boot  
**[1:17:28-1:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:17:28):**  Whatever  Okay, we're eating one that's five years old that I jerked out of the pasture and hauled to the processor  Yeah  
**[1:17:36-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:17:36):**  Is it tough?  It's only slightly tougher than anything you'd buy at walmart  Right the taste is freaking amazing  
**[1:17:44-1:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:17:44):**  Right, I can eat an eight ounce piece of that and be way more full than eating a 24 ounce  Certified angus from walmart, okay  Marbling it wouldn't a graded prime  
**[1:17:58-1:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:17:58):**  But it's really good looking meat. It's it's super good looking meat and I wouldn't say  That it's tougher than old boot leather  in fact, I had a  
**[1:18:07-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:18:07):**  one of the folks that I sold a half to  They had sirloins the other night and they said once they got past the connective tissue on the outside and the fat  That it was so tender. They could almost cut it with a fork  
**[1:18:19-1:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:18:19):**  Interesting like okay  Yeah, by the way, I just want you to know that was a six-year-old coriander that I pulled out of the pasture and hauled to the processor  That's interesting  
**[1:18:30-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:18:30):**  So there's  Not all grass finnet not all grass is created equal I agree with that  and  
**[1:18:44-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:18:44):**  That's something  that there is a quality issue like with people doing grass-fed beef because  The forage that they ate for the last 60 days has so much of an effect on the flavor profile of that meat  
**[1:18:57-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:18:57):**  Yes  And that's that's what it really comes down to is is the diet that lasts, you know, is 60 to 90 days  that's going to give a lot of the meat and flavor profile and when I  
**[1:19:09-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:09):**  When I eat some of this that you know out of ours that we processed  I can close my eyes and almost get a vision  of the grasses and that you know of the forbs and of the  
**[1:19:20-1:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:20):**  Of the area that they've been in for the last couple of months. I can almost get that vision in my head  Just from the taste that are in my mouth  right  
**[1:19:29-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:29):**  and  I don't think that I don't think the folks that are going to walmart buying that cab that prime cab  Get near that same experience  
**[1:19:40-1:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:40):**  right  Because I mean, you know because a lot of those stairs they're  they're pushed too hard too quick and  
**[1:19:49-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:49):**  You know tenderness and you know marbling it it that that's what takes time  You know  And that's that's why I like Wagyu  
**[1:19:59-1:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:19:59):**  Cattle that that's why it takes so long for them to  Develop that marbling. That's why it takes what 32 months give or take yeah for them to finish  Because like if you look if you butcher a Wagyu  
**[1:20:12-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:20:12):**  Animal as a yearling or 14 months old  It's not gonna have much better marbling than a korean  Yep  
**[1:20:22-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:20:22):**  You know, so it it all depends on how they're developed how long they're developed  And you know the way you do it what you do it on what you develop them on  It's what you develop them on I think is is is a lot of it. Yeah  
**[1:20:39-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:20:39):**  you know I  I feel like I can take any of my calves  At any age after weaning  
**[1:20:47-1:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:20:47):**  After weaning and they could they could go to the yard and transition to corn and gain  Great. Mm-hmm. Would they finish like a straight up Angus?  At the same weight hell no  
**[1:21:00-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:21:00):**  I'm, i'm gonna be a lot lighter. I'm gonna be probably 20 percent, you know, 15 to 20 percent lighter  and finish weight  Yeah, but it'll still finish. It'll still pack on pounds and it'll still pack on marbling and condition and  
**[1:21:12-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:21:12):**  And  I my old mentor ed  Now granted this is all anecdotal and third hand whatever right he told me that he uh, he sent a  
**[1:21:28-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:21:28):**  He had some corriente  charlay cross calves  And he had a whole lot load of them. Mm-hmm. And he he kept ownership of them all the way through the yard all the way  
**[1:21:37-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:21:37):**  to the plant  How many of pot load of  Corriente charlay cross calves you think graded into the cab system  
**[1:21:48-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:21:48):**  He said he had over he said he had 40 percent  Of those calves that didn't have a drop of angus blood in them. None of them were black. It's at 50  Oh, really? He pulled cab premium on them  
**[1:22:00-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:00):**  Wow. Yeah, and I think uh  Almost 20 percent of them graded prime  graded prime  
**[1:22:09-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:09):**  And another thing that goes into it that I don't think  people really grasp  A handle on is is genetics genetics play a huge factor into it because in the beef master business  
**[1:22:22-1:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:22):**  you'll have animals that are  because like we scan our cattle, I think the  The deadline window is 500 days either 500 550 days ones. No, I think it's 500 days  
**[1:22:35-1:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:35):**  but anyway, so  so they  They get scanned and I mean you can tell which genetics  
**[1:22:43-1:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:43):**  Uh consistently marble well, which ones don't  um  and  
**[1:22:48-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:48):**  like especially  You go like because there's a bull  developed by lorenza lasseter called elbar and fuego  
**[1:22:55-1:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:22:55):**  He is one of the better marbling bulls and a lot of the a lot of those calves are developed on straight grass  And so like you can look at that rib fat  And then look at that marbling until which one are the true marblers for example if you have  
**[1:23:09-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:09):**  uh an animal that  marbles at a 4.5 which is a choice, okay, okay, and then you have they have  Under a tenth of an inch of rib fat  
**[1:23:22-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:22):**  That's going to be one of your good marblers  But then you have an animal that has  I don't know a 2.5  
**[1:23:30-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:30):**  IMF  but then has  0.25  
**[1:23:36-1:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:36):**  rib fat  That's not going to marble that well. And so like in the in part of what I when I select cattle  And i'm looking for that marbling content. That's what I look for is I kind of  
**[1:23:49-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:49):**  uh compare  the marbling to the rib fat, okay, and so that's you know, I uh,  So are you looking for a ratio between?  
**[1:23:59-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:23:59):**  rib fat and the marble score  So each each certain characteristic have their own ratio  um, but yeah, I mean in in uh, I mean  
**[1:24:10-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:24:10):**  I'd like I'd say I mean in an ideal world. I like to have an IMF score of at least four because that's choice  But I will you know all accepts in the threes because that's high select  High select um and so  
**[1:24:27-1:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:24:27):**  if you theoretically if you can do high select or choice on forage only  Switching to grain in a feedlot will bump that up significantly  Yeah, and then so and of course, you know the usda considers finished at 0.45  
**[1:24:43-1:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:24:43):**  so if I if they can have but like you can you can also tell  If an animal's been fed grain or not based on how big that rib rib and rump fat is too. So like if uh,  You know, they're at close to finished, you know, they've been developed but if they are  
**[1:25:01-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:25:01):**  Under  I would say I mean if they're like close to a tenth of an inch of rib fat or less they've definitely that's straight grasp easy  Um, so I mean again when you can find an animal that marbles high  
**[1:25:16-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:25:16):**  that marbles high  with  a minimal amount of rib fat  
**[1:25:22-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:25:22):**  That's your outlier right there. And that's the one you want to keep  Correct. Okay  So let's take away. Let's take away all the technology tools  
**[1:25:32-1:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:25:32):**  Okay, what's your visual indicator for that flushing ability? Okay. What are you looking at specifically?  If an animal can keep their condition  In a rough environment that's part that's a lot of it, um, but it's not not just that but like like  
**[1:25:49-1:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:25:49):**  In terms of carcass merit, but an animal that has a good that is easy flushing  Flushing ability correlates to fertility as well. Yes  so  
**[1:26:01-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:26:01):**  I mean visually if you can find an animal that  Is has a good flushing ability  Those are the ones you need to keep as well  
**[1:26:11-1:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:26:11):**  I guess what um, like are you looking at anything specifically in the ribeye or rump area versus ribs?  Um, so  I don't know how to explain it but like you can tell  
**[1:26:26-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:26:26):**  If an animal is going to have a lot of ribeye area if like if you look look at them from behind or just look  At their top their top lines are going to be significantly wider  Sometimes you have those animals that have like if you look at a loaf of bread it kind of  
**[1:26:40-1:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:26:40):**  Has has that groove and then dips in the middle that's going to be a big ribeye animal  You know, so basically with the top is going to emphasize ribeye area  And then just muscle expression itself  
**[1:26:57-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:26:57):**  Okay  Okay  Okay  
**[1:27:04-1:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:27:04):**  So let's um, tell you  Tell me about what what what's your job description for a cow  What what makes a successful cow for john tipton?  
**[1:27:21-1:27:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:27:21):**  Well, uh cows are a factory they need to work  um  You know, they can't be pampered. They need they  
**[1:27:28-1:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:27:28):**  Need to get bred around 13 to 15 months of age starting  They need to have that calf  At around two years old  
**[1:27:42-1:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:27:42):**  You need to have they need to have a good udder  You know real tight bag plant, you know small teats it's where that calf can fit in its mouth without me having to help it  And then she needs to get bred back when that calf is that side  
**[1:27:57-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:27:57):**  And she needs to continue doing that throughout her life  Do you pull calves not really I mean I have but not in a while. Um  The last time I did it, uh,  
**[1:28:15-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:28:15):**  I I think I mean you can you can also to like  Because the calf was born late  Um, and it was a heifer that was born  
**[1:28:27-1:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:28:27):**  Over a hundred pounds, which isn't normal  But and it was it was off of a heifer too. So the first calf effort  Did you keep her did you get rid of her? She died she had she had an aneurysm. Oh, that's not ideal. No, so  
**[1:28:45-1:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:28:45):**  But I guess that that still answers the question yeah, I mean, okay, would you would you have kept her?  Uh  It it would depend on the circumstances. I mean it would depend on the due date of that calf. It was if it was born late, you know  
**[1:29:03-1:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:03):**  Um  Is it that cow's fault?  But at the same time  
**[1:29:10-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:10):**  When I select for animals I look at  You know their adjusted birth weights. I look at their birth weight ratios and I look at that birth weight EPD  I mean on heifers, especially  
**[1:29:24-1:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:24):**  I use a bull that I know will be a calving ease bull  Okay, and so  You know for the most part I haven't been  
**[1:29:34-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:34):**  I haven't been wrong  uh when selecting on what I mean, it's you know heifers especially that you gotta  You gotta make sure that they're with a bull that isn't gonna throw 90 pound calves  
**[1:29:46-1:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:46):**  I mean, I could definitely see that I could definitely see that so  But also when it comes to birth weights  It's not all on the cow. It's on the bull, too  
**[1:29:59-1:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:29:59):**  So you can't call a cow for something that's 50  100% responsible on the bull  Okay  
**[1:30:09-1:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:30:09):**  I I mean I I can see your point like yeah  I like to say that i'm a little more strict than that, you know, if a cow doesn't bring in a live calf  Well, no, I mean if the cow doesn't bring in a live calf, I mean  
**[1:30:23-1:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:30:23):**  Doesn't bring in a live calf  Or she has to be assisted  Yeah, she just go down the road, right? And I mean I agree with that though  
**[1:30:31-1:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:30:31):**  Whatever reason she didn't bring in a calf even if she had a live calf and it got eaten by coyotes  Or the calf got sick and died  Well, if you're gonna blame the cow if you read that that book that tom lester wrote or lori lester wrote  
**[1:30:46-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:30:46):**  uh  lester's philosophy of cattle raising  um  
**[1:30:51-1:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:30:51):**  Whenever you keep a cow that has lost a calf  That cow is going to have an advantage over other all the other cows that have had calves. Um  And so explain that to me like i'm five  
**[1:31:05-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:31:05):**  Because because to me  You know, like like we talked about with the job description of a cow. She's got to bring in a calf  I mean that's her whole entire job  
**[1:31:14-1:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:31:14):**  And if she rolls a donut one year like that's got to be a balance between what is her  What is her genetic value to my herd?  Of future progeny and can I afford to feed her for another year?  
**[1:31:30-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:31:30):**  In order to try to get another calf out of her, right? And I I get what you're saying  But I think a lot of guys get in a trap like oh, we'll breed her back next year. She'll get back next year  And you know, they'll put two or three hundred dollars a cost in the cow over the winter to keep her around  
**[1:31:44-1:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:31:44):**  Instead of turning her into a thousand dollar bill  They'll put three hundred dollars a cost in her try to breed her again next year and she rolls a donut the second year  Well, yeah, no, I mean  
**[1:31:56-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:31:56):**  Most I mean we've again we've never really had calving issues. So I  so that that answer was you know that  the question was kind of  
**[1:32:08-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:32:08):**  You know different because I mean it's just we we haven't really run into that issue  much but um  You know, so again  
**[1:32:18-1:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:32:18):**  When that cow the cow has the advantage because  It has a lot longer time to recuperate compared to the other cows that do have calves  So she has an advantage of recuperating compared to those other cows  
**[1:32:33-1:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:32:33):**  But then if we keep her in our herd because she had  Let's say an unfair advantage of a of an unproductive year to gain back that body condition  to gain back that body condition  
**[1:32:46-1:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:32:46):**  I I kind of almost feel like  that's not doing us favors down the line because then we have  genetics that  
**[1:32:54-1:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:32:54):**  That need to skip a year to to get back to fertility  right  No, I agree  
**[1:33:01-1:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:01):**  Yeah  But you got to do what works for you and your environment. I mean  Every everybody has a total everybody's got a totally different situation and that's the bottom line, right?  
**[1:33:11-1:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:11):**  You know what works for me won't work for my neighbors across the fence  right and so  um, you know and another thing that came out of that philosophy book is  
**[1:33:23-1:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:23):**  A cow should provide a dividend  Every year whether it's that calf or her  Yes  
**[1:33:32-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:32):**  Yes  And sometimes the dividend is uh, is it freezer camp that's true. That's true. Ah  So, uh, so how do things look for you the rest of the winter?  
**[1:33:46-1:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:46):**  Do you have enough forage to get through back to green grass or are you uh still working on that?  Uh, let's see. We got  An inch of rain at both places not too long ago, but I don't think that's near enough for what we need  
**[1:33:58-1:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:33:58):**  I think we need about a good 10 inches  You know to fill up our tanks  um  
**[1:34:04-1:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:04):**  but as far as forage goes  uh, it's  As of right now, it's not looking good. Uh, because from  
**[1:34:14-1:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:14):**  From all that summer drought  but  So I definitely don't have any stockpile grass whatsoever  
**[1:34:20-1:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:20):**  um, but we like I said, we bought about 120 bales  Of improved jigs grass so that'll that's helping us so far whenever  You know, we need to feed cows  
**[1:34:32-1:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:32):**  Um, you know  but you know, I I get that like  Unless you saw unless you saw the drought coming in the spring  
**[1:34:43-1:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:43):**  Yeah, there's no way to prepare for it unless you saw it coming in the spring. Well, the thing is is i'm kind of  Based on how the winter goes is how the rest of the year is going to go  and so like  
**[1:34:58-1:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:34:58):**  This the last winter it didn't rain that much  So I didn't really think anything of it, but looking back on it  That's probably a big indication. We're gonna have a bad drought  
**[1:35:12-1:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:35:12):**  Generally, yeah  um, my benchmark is  Less than four inches of rain between November 1 and April 1 indicates indicates drought  
**[1:35:23-1:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:35:23):**  and you know, keep in mind that's based on my 22 inches ish of rainfall a year and the  Let's call it the statistical average distribution of rainfall throughout the year for the last 130 years  If I don't get four inches in the in the dormant season  
**[1:35:43-1:35:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:35:43):**  I better be planning for drought. It better be dry last year. We had like two and a half  Yeah, so, you know, i'm i'm looking in going into April  Going into April, you know, i'm going through March  
**[1:35:55-1:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:35:55):**  I know where i'm already sitting for rain. I can look at the national drought monitor  And look at the drought mitigation center. I can look at the climate prediction center and back in March. They're all saying the same thing  Like it's going to be dry for the next three months like okay  
**[1:36:10-1:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:36:10):**  I've got a drought indicator  CPC says drought for three months. That's where i'm going. That's where i'm planning right and that's the direction I went and  It seems like  
**[1:36:22-1:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:36:22):**  It seems like the people that are really struggling through this drought are the people that have never been through one  Yeah, I mean it's  you know  
**[1:36:34-1:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:36:34):**  How you know south texas it's it's been prone to  Or at least in the halos area it can you know  Drought, you know smaller droughts  
**[1:36:44-1:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:36:44):**  Have been common, you know, like to the point of where the grasses become dead  But  Never to the point of where I just have no grass  
**[1:36:56-1:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:36:56):**  You know to where to where the grass just doesn't grow at all, you know  And it was scary I i've never seen it this bad in my life  This bad my life, um, so the last bad drought we had here, uh, 10 11 12  
**[1:37:14-1:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:37:14):**  It was it was not near this bad  yeah, and some of the old timers that have um  Since gone extinct and departed us on this earth  
**[1:37:25-1:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:37:25):**  They  I remember several of them saying that the drought that we had back there 10 11 12  Was worse  
**[1:37:32-1:37:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:37:32):**  Than the bad one they had in the mid-50s around here  Now  I was thinking about this last night. Um when we were coming back from town  
**[1:37:44-1:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:37:44):**  I feel like I kind of have  A half-assed accurate picture of the history of the plains as far as major events, you know  Europeans when they were aware and you know when when native americans were where and you know who did what?  
**[1:37:58-1:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:37:58):**  And and how things may have looked like I feel like I kind of have a general idea of that  but then like I get into more specific things about you know, how things were here and how things have been here for the last  150 years  
**[1:38:13-1:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:38:13):**  And you know doing this podcast talking to folks like you and you know, a lot of other people i've talked to  um  I think there's a lot of history that we don't understand about our area and about you know, what went on and what was there?  
**[1:38:25-1:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:38:25):**  You know the last hundred hundred and fifty years and how the area used to look  right  and  
**[1:38:33-1:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:38:33):**  Not saying that, you know that that's where we're going back to but  I guess what i'm saying is  you know that  
**[1:38:42-1:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:38:42):**  Yeah, shit. I guess I don't know what i'm saying. Lost train of thought again. That'll happen  Um  So yeah planning for winter i'm um, i'm still struggling to get  
**[1:38:58-1:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:38:58):**  The supplement hay that I need  okay, and  i'm gonna own that one I uh  
**[1:39:05-1:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:39:05):**  I should I should be I should have been more proactive  In making that happen instead of relying on somebody else to get it for me. So yeah  Yeah, that's why that's kind of why we've me and my dad have tried to bail our own hay  
**[1:39:18-1:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:39:18):**  um a lot of the hay that we do build though comes from  uh our neighbors so  Uh, like well, you know bail hay for them then split the hay 50 50  
**[1:39:31-1:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:39:31):**  Yeah  Yeah, and that that totally makes sense. You know, like we were talking earlier  Uh, you know, i've got you know, it's old farm ground  
**[1:39:39-1:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:39:39):**  Man, it sure would be sure would be nice to have my own hay field or have my own alfalfa field  You know, it's just there that you know, I hire somebody to come in and plant  I hired somebody to come in and bail well, then you get in a custom hire expense  
**[1:39:54-1:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:39:54):**  Well, then we're farming now and then oh well while we're doing that let's let's maybe plant some cover crops so we could strip graze  you know, there's a lot of possibilities like um  so, you know, I thought about  
**[1:40:09-1:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:40:09):**  Just trying to come up with various schemes to get my cows through the winter  on as little as possible  With as little effort and labor and and diesel fuel as possible  
**[1:40:19-1:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:40:19):**  and you know part of me think part of me still kind of thinks that  That maybe plant some cool season covers  Yeah is not the dumbest thing in the world that I could do right? I mean, it's it's it's helped us like because  
**[1:40:34-1:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:40:34):**  If I remember whenever we  Only put out hay  I mean every other day we would plant some cool season covers  
**[1:40:41-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:40:41):**  I mean every other day we'd be putting out two bales per place kind of thing  and  Then whenever we started planting oats  
**[1:40:50-1:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:40:50):**  I mean  I have about what 30 mama cows when we've had that for a while, but  There was sometimes where we only put out 20 bales that winter  
**[1:41:03-1:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:03):**  Ouch  Well, I mean because of those oats, I mean we didn't yeah, we did  Oh, you didn't need to put up that because you had the oats. Yeah, gotcha. Right. Yeah. Yeah, we didn't  
**[1:41:14-1:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:14):**  You know, we didn't we you know our hay feeding  Depleted tremendously once we put up those those winter grasses  So and and I mean, you know again  
**[1:41:26-1:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:26):**  I'm trying to figure out a more cost effective way to put that out in that and you know, my guess is is to  to no-till it  Yeah  
**[1:41:37-1:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:37):**  Yeah, well there's uh  Some other strategies, you know if you're gonna  One one strategy I've seen I think my friend Katie talked about it  
**[1:41:49-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:49):**  um  About doing like a swath grazing type scenario  Where they do go in with a swather and lay everything down and put it in a swath  
**[1:41:58-1:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:41:58):**  and maybe they and maybe they might bail a little bit of it just so they know like  How many feet down that swath?  Is x number of pounds?  
**[1:42:07-1:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:42:07):**  Right, so then they just fence off  A portion of that swath and you know like make blocks  So if you need you know, if your cows are gonna need two thousand pounds of forage for the day  
**[1:42:18-1:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:42:18):**  You just go out and you measure off what about two thousand pounds is in that swath and add a little bit for  poor measurement and fudge factor  right and roll with that and then  
**[1:42:28-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:42:28):**  You know, there's still a diesel fuel pass of the swather  But compared to the fuel for baling and the time for baling  It's a lot less  
**[1:42:38-1:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:42:38):**  It is and you know  You can replace that baler and a tractor and then the loader tractor and the bale trailer  With a guy on a four-wheeler with a reel of poly wire  
**[1:42:49-1:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:42:49):**  Right  So there's also that um  I got to get out of here a little bit. Let's talk about hay war and then uh, then we can go oh man  
**[1:43:02-1:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:43:02):**  I didn't pay too much attention to it, but it was it was uh, it was entertaining for sure  Yeah, so, uh, it hasn't come out yet but uh previous episode I've done that everybody should have already listened to by that  And this comes out with uh with Caitlin from Noble Research  
**[1:43:20-1:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:43:20):**  Okay, the you're wrong. Mm-hmm  She she kind of got a little salty with me. She's like yeah you started all that then you just ghosted everybody on the app  and left us to fight your battles for you like  
**[1:43:33-1:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:43:33):**  Sorry when I get a video that's get half a million views  I gotta log out and not read comments for a while because that shit is not good for my mental health  right  
**[1:43:42-1:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:43:42):**  Man, I tell you what that that app can get stressful for sure  Yeah, there's something it's tight. There's it's a different level of toxic for sure  But it's also a different level of connection it is yeah, I I mean  
**[1:43:56-1:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:43:56):**  There's things on that app that I've learned  Like because I mean I I have an animal science degree there's things on that app that I've learned that I didn't learn in college  You know, there's a lot of things that I did learn in college college  
**[1:44:12-1:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:44:12):**  That were extremely useful that I still use today, you know, like AI  I learned out of AI in college and I am AI my own cattle, but I mean  Again, there's just it's a different kind of informative  
**[1:44:25-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:44:25):**  right  And it's a different  It's a different kind of engagement than pretty much any other platform too. It is it is and you hit a different audience  
**[1:44:38-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:44:38):**  I mean, I I I I  I mean, I there's always all kinds of weird stuff coming up on my coming up on my for you feeds. I'm like  Why is this here?  
**[1:44:47-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:44:47):**  But uh pet raccoons pet tigers i'm like what in the hell is this?  Yeah, and then the next one is somebody dancing and then the next one is somebody yelling about the price of hay  I mean, it's it's yeah  
**[1:45:01-1:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:01):**  Yeah, it's kind of wild  But I will I and maybe this is echo chamber effect  I see more conventional guys starting to ask questions  
**[1:45:10-1:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:10):**  And moving towards the more regenerative practices then I see guys doing regenerative stuff going the other way  I would agree with that because I mean i'm probably an example of that because  i've all i've  
**[1:45:22-1:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:22):**  known is conventional stuff, but  um  You know, i'm i'm  
**[1:45:30-1:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:30):**  again, my main  Again, my main thing that i'm wanting to accomplish is cut the cost that I have been paying for  um and then being able to  
**[1:45:44-1:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:44):**  improve the environment for the longevity of  my family down the line  right  
**[1:45:51-1:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:45:51):**  so  And I want my great great grandkids to still be raising beef master cattle. I doubt that would probably happen  But you know, that's that's the goal  
**[1:46:01-1:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:46:01):**  and so if I can  Be able to make that happen in any way I can that's what i'm gonna try to do  I like it. I was I was sitting here thinking listening to talk thinking and thinking back to  
**[1:46:17-1:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:46:17):**  Oh, we were talking about vegans earlier. Mm-hmm. And  I think once once people kind of start coming over to regenerative agriculture and learning about the soil and ecosystem function  We start asking questions  
**[1:46:32-1:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:46:32):**  About conventional practices and a lot of those conventional practices that are accepted  Are indefensible from an animal welfare point of view or a human health point of view  And  
**[1:46:48-1:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:46:48):**  Social media is helping shine a light in some of those dark corners and asking some of those questions  That that some of the big players in the industry would rather not have asked  Or rather not have said out loud  
**[1:47:01-1:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:01):**  See vegans back to vegans  Again, I forget I  I need to take better notes. I forgot what the hell I was going to say again  
**[1:47:10-1:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:10):**  We we've got to be a little more transparent we got to be a little bit more open about what we're doing  And better about meeting people where they are not just other producers  But some of these vegans are going to be more open about what we're doing  
**[1:47:24-1:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:24):**  Not just other producers but some of these vegans and  I I think it bears to be said that you know  They just have a they have a a strange idea of what sort of animal suffering is acceptable  
**[1:47:44-1:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:44):**  Like okay  You want everybody to eat plant-based diet?  Great  
**[1:47:49-1:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:49):**  Let's farm up the whole damn world and let's plant everything, you know to soy and kale  right  But here's the problem  
**[1:47:58-1:48:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:47:58):**  When we rip up those fields, we destroy all the life in those fields. We spray our insecticides on and we kill all the insects  Which in turn is less food for birds, which in turn is less food for other birds and other predators  so it's like  
**[1:48:15-1:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:48:15):**  We  If we follow the path that the vegans want us to follow bill gates wants us to follow eating fucking fake meat  And plants all the time  
**[1:48:25-1:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:48:25):**  We're going to be on a brown ball of dust  Yeah, like wall-e the movie wall-e is our future, right if we go down that path  And then their whole ideology is just going to go down the crap hole  
**[1:48:38-1:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:48:38):**  Because they can't grow nothing  exactly  like  
**[1:48:44-1:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:48:44):**  Oh, we'll just invent our way out. We'll just invent new fertilizers. We'll just invent better pesticides. We'll just invent better insecticides  No, I don't think that works anymore. I think we're at the point  Where mother nature has said?  
**[1:48:55-1:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:48:55):**  enough  enough with the bullshit  right  
**[1:49:01-1:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:01):**  And  I think I think it could be scary in the future with you know food availability  you know, there's  
**[1:49:10-1:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:10):**  That i'm seeing  I've been seeing it on on our favorite app and on and on facebook, uh the last couple of days  And by the time this comes out it may be a reality  
**[1:49:22-1:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:22):**  that  There just might not be winter vegetables  Yeah  
**[1:49:27-1:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:27):**  because of the drought and lack of lack of irrigation water and too high temperatures where  In southwest arizona where most of our vegetables are growing for the winter  Well to kind of give you a better understanding of how bad that drought this drought has been our water well went dry at the house  
**[1:49:43-1:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:43):**  Oh fuck  Yeah, and so I because I have I have breeding seasons for my bulls, you know from my herd  I had to turn around and let my bulls out with my cows. So they're going to have summer calves some of them  
**[1:49:58-1:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:49:58):**  So you can take a shower or wash dishes, is that what you're telling me?  Well, that's so this is our I don't live at that place. But yes, okay  So I mean I because like where I live I live in katie, which is in outskirts of houston  
**[1:50:10-1:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:50:10):**  But why didn't you just tell me you lived in katie? I know where that is  Like howlet's mill and all these other little towns. I don't know where the hell that's at. Yeah. Katie. I know where that's at  Yeah, like so good, right?  
**[1:50:21-1:50:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:50:21):**  Uh  No, that's like it's on the west side of houston, okay. Yeah  But yeah, so I mean because my buddy he uh was down the road and i'll shower his place  
**[1:50:35-1:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:50:35):**  When I go out there  Wow  we had um  
**[1:50:41-1:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:50:41):**  We had some we had some friends. We're in the executive link program with that. Um,  Let's see. How do I tell this story without any identifying details?  Let's just say they were in northeast colorado  
**[1:50:54-1:51:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:50:54):**  Northeast colorado  And they had a fairly small operation and they'd been there  After they'd been there about a year. They had to drill another water well, and it wasn't that great  
**[1:51:04-1:51:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:04):**  And then they got like the property they had came with a water right?  from  Another property north that they got to use and they had water at their house, you know the barn and the guest house  
**[1:51:16-1:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:16):**  and one of their first  one of their first concerns was well, how do we do this, you know, how do we build this business and I said like  So hold on here  
**[1:51:25-1:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:25):**  You moved in there and a year later one well went dry  So you start getting water from the other one and it's dropped 15 feet in the last couple years. Mm-hmm  um  
**[1:51:36-1:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:36):**  How are you guys gonna run a feedlot and raise cows if you don't have water there?  right and they just kind of stopped and  You know over the next couple months they went back and they you know went back through the well logs and did some work on  
**[1:51:47-1:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:47):**  their water wells and they came back to the next meeting and we're like, um, yeah, we're worried about the water  We're probably gonna sell the place  Right and they're in nebraska now  
**[1:51:56-1:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:51:56):**  Wow, and you know, I I get that like eastern colorado is a totally different scenario than where you're at but  I think the important thing to say here is  we've mismanaged water in a lot of the country and  
**[1:52:10-1:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:52:10):**  You know  It's one thing to run out of grass in a drought  It's another thing to run out of water. Yeah, that's a much much bigger deal and it is  
**[1:52:20-1:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:52:20):**  You know, we talk about drought proofing the ranch with grazing planning  Another huge part of that is drought planning drought proofing the ranch with infrastructure  I mean  
**[1:52:33-1:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:52:33):**  I'm in a we've been talking about drought all the episode. Yeah  I'm not gonna sit here and bullshit anybody and say my creeks are fine because they're not  They're hurting my ponds  
**[1:52:45-1:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:52:45):**  Okay stock tanks. They're all hurting too. Right three to four feet low  Which isn't a big deal when all your shit is 15 feet deep  Right, you know if your pond is only five feet deep and it's four feet low I get that's a problem  
**[1:53:01-1:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:53:01):**  but you know, I  I don't know but you know, I all the all the ponds on the ranch are fairly young and  They're not full of dirt and they were designed to be deep to be able to you know, to be able to live through  
**[1:53:17-1:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:53:17):**  Droughts like this so right. I'm  And and drought proofing the ranch for me  Is um  
**[1:53:26-1:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:53:26):**  Let's see. Let's see if I can do this off top my head cold. I've got 29 tanks  I've got nine different pumping stations and eight water systems  I've got two storage locations and each storage location. I store about 20 000 gallons of water  
**[1:53:42-1:53:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:53:42):**  Wow  So I don't have to rely on groundwater to water my cows is is the moral of the story because  Ponds go dry creeks go dry  
**[1:53:56-1:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:53:56):**  Preaks go dry. If my water wells go dry  There will have been signs that they're going to be in pain  Like my ponds will have to be dry for a long time before i'm going to lose well with my water or lose my water  
**[1:54:10-1:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:10):**  wells  so  But that being said, you know you we just I just  
**[1:54:18-1:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:18):**  learn to not rely on a creek or a pond and  so  That's my emergency grass. Yeah, I still have grazing around my ponds. I still have grass around my creeks  
**[1:54:31-1:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:31):**  And i've deliberately saved that in case I do have a major water system failure  right  You know  
**[1:54:38-1:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:38):**  in a better year  That might not be so much of a component in the plan, right but  These last two years  
**[1:54:48-1:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:48):**  I've had to make sure i've left grazing  Where I could get to it if I had a major water problem  right, I mean I  
**[1:54:56-1:55:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:54:56):**  From from the bull say that we had I lucked out  I mean that's gonna pretty much pay our way for  Drilling a new well. Hey, there's somebody at my door. I will be right back. All right  
**[1:55:11-1:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:55:11):**  It was just fedex dropping something off they felt the need to knock on the door extra loud today for some reason  That'll happen, you know when you live  20 miles from town and somebody knocks on your door middle of the day. You should probably go see who that is. Yeah  
**[1:55:25-1:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:55:25):**  Yeah, yeah, and it's weird because like if some like as if i'm at my parents house in the middle of houston  Someone knocks on door. It's like whatever but like if i'm at the ranch and someone knocks on my door I get a little like  Okay. Well, what is that?  
**[1:55:38-1:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:55:38):**  Yeah, what are you doing in my driveway? How did you get here?  You know, it's a  It's it's a little different out at the ranch it is because I mean you don't know it could be anybody, you know  
**[1:55:53-1:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:55:53):**  Well, I live off of a back road  Yeah, it's a paved road, but it's still a back road. I mean, it's pretty much only locals  It's not it's not really a through road it right  
**[1:56:05-1:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:56:05):**  But where the ranch is down on the highway  Us highway 160 cuts right through the place  And headquarters where my dad lives where the shop is where my pens are  
**[1:56:17-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:56:17):**  It's on the highway  Oh, wow, it's right on the highway  and  
**[1:56:25-1:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:56:25):**  It hasn't happened a long time since you know people got gps and you know tom tom map quest but uh  I remember there was a story my dad used to tell  It would have been it would have had to have been earlier mid-90s  
**[1:56:39-1:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:56:39):**  He was out on the porch one day just drinking a beer  And this fella rolls in like a Lincoln town car  right  
**[1:56:48-1:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:56:48):**  And you know, they have this conversation and this guy starts asking him like  Oh, where's the nearest fuel? Well, it's another 20 miles down the road. Where's nearest hotel? It's another  20 miles down the road  
**[1:57:00-1:57:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:57:00):**  And then the guy's like well, where are the mountains?  And dad's like what?  These are the foothills right? I'm close to the rocky. I thought should be close to rocky mountains, right?  
**[1:57:13-1:57:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:57:13):**  And dad's like no, no, sir  You need to get back in your car go another seven hours if you think you're in the mountains  I had no idea where he was  
**[1:57:24-1:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:57:24):**  He was just driving west to go to the mountains to go to colorado  Like no, you're about seven hours short pal. Mm-hmm  Yeah, that guy might have been  
**[1:57:33-1:57:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/90-Jon-Tipton-e1qn7vu#t=1:57:33):**  He might have had all six cans of a six-pack just didn't have the plastic thing and you keep them all together right?  All right, man, is there uh, is there anything you want to talk about today or uh, you ready to get out of here?  I think that's about that about covers it man.

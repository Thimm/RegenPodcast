We got a really special treat lined up for you today.  A lot of people have been asking questions.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:00:54):**  What is blockchain?  What is beef chain?  And what the heck is cryptocurrency?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:00:59):**  Our guest today, hopefully we can get some of those questions answered.  He's from Wyoming, he's a cattleman, and he's involved with beef chain.  So welcome to the show, Drew Pearson.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:09):**  Drew, welcome to Ranching Reboot.  Hey, thanks for having me.  It's great to have you here.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:16):**  And oh man, CK, don't quit glaring at me.  Did you forget about me?  No, I kind of did.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:23):**  With me as always.  You're here too guys, don't forget about me.  Yeah, can't forget about CK.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:27):**  CK, our co-pilot.  So Drew, first let's start off with some of your background.  Where are you at and how'd you get there?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:39):**  Well I'm in the northeast corner of Wyoming.  I'm actually, our ranch is right halfway in between the Black Hills, which I don't  know if people have heard of that, like Deadwood, South Dakota is in the Black Hills, and the  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:49):**  Big Horn Mountain.  I'm centered right in the middle of that.  It's kind of like the country here is big rolling hills, lots of sagebrush.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:01:58):**  I got here, my great grandpa on my dad's side came here from Sweden at the turn of the century  in the early 1900s.  Him and three of his brothers homesteaded here and then he just ended up with all of  
**[0:02:08-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:02:08):**  it.  On my mom's side, one of her grandpas was one of those guys that ran away from home  from an abusive father when he was a teenager and joined a cattle drive, you know, with  
**[0:02:19-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:02:19):**  that old story and ended up here and he homesteaded a place also.  And so we run mostly Black Angus cattle.  We run on about 20,000 acres here.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:02:34):**  So that 20,000 acres, is that mostly like BLM or permanent lands or is that all deeded?  In most of it's deeded.  We have a couple of Wyoming safe sections.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:02:44):**  There's a couple of little chunks of BLM that we've got and you know, dealing with  BLM the last couple of years has not been very fun, but we make it work.  What do you think is the most not fun as far as BLM?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:02:59):**  Just what their requirements or?  Well, so we've got some land that has these buttes on it and on the very top of them is  BLM land.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:03:09):**  And so the BLM came up with this rule, it's called their viewshed rule.  And if a Native American is to stand on top of that and there's something within their  viewshed they don't like, or if you're wanting to build something like a fence or a road  
**[0:03:22-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:03:22):**  or oil well is going to be drilled, you have to okay it through them.  And it used to be something like 100 yards was the viewshed rule.  They tried expanding that out to like five or 10 miles.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:03:32):**  So then that was going to be affecting people's ranches that weren't even associated with  this part piece of BLM land.  And you know, that was about a summer of fighting with that and getting that taken care of.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:03:44):**  But it was it was a pain.  But that I'm fortunate that I live in a state that is 98% privately owned, and I have deeds  to all my stuff, and I don't have to worry about things like that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:03:59):**  But I think we also have to be conscious about, you know, sharing our land with, you know,  with people that do have a historical tie to it.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:04:08):**  And, you know, we never had any problem with with those people going and doing whatever  they wanted there, but this this viewshed thing where on my own private land, I can't  build a fence without government's permission or whoever.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:04:24):**  Oh, it goes against my I'm sure we could have some fun conversations about government and  food police later.  But so you're, you say you're third fourth generation there on the ranch.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:04:37):**  You know, that's that's kind of getting increasingly rare as, you know, things are harder to keep  in the family.  So like, describe your operation.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:04:46):**  You said you had your primarily black Angus cows, are you are you more of the regenerative  side and rotationally grazing?  Are you still more on the conventional side?  
**[0:04:54-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:04:54):**  Like there's not any judgment.  Oh, no, so definitely sort of the conventional I've, I've done quite a few things here, you  know, like raising smaller cows and what we used to try and get into, you know, 11, 100  
**[0:05:08-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:05:08):**  pound cow is the max size we want and smaller groups of cows in different pastures just,  it helps me manage things better and pay attention to the grass better and managing my grass  better because where we're at the climate is so kind of temperamental, like last year  
**[0:05:26-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:05:26):**  was just an absolute horrible drought.  And those come along around here every five or six years.  And if you're overstocked, that just get paid for that twice.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:05:38):**  Yeah, don't you guys have like crazy terrible wind?  I know I've driven through Wyoming and I thought I was gonna die.  But I mean, for the most part, you guys have some crazy wind that like how fast do they  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:05:49):**  go or the speed?  I would say I would say an average day you're gonna have, you know, five to 20 mile an hour  winds, that's just average.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:05:57):**  You know, the kind of windy day for us is, you know, 30 miles an hour.  And then when they get up to the 60 mile an hour winds and start tipping over.  That's what people start talking about.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:06:08):**  I usually get blown back into the house when it hits about 20 or 25.  blown back into the house.  Is there like some is it like the climate and region like someone asked me why they're  
**[0:06:22-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:06:22):**  what Wyoming was when he was like, I don't know, I should ask someone who's from Wyoming.  I think it kind of has to do with with the Canadian plains and then the Rocky Mountains,  you know, the we have what they call Alberta Clippers and things like that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:06:36):**  And when coming from planes in the mountains, funneling it and what things like that.  So that makes sense.  So yeah, we've we raised mostly black Angus cattle.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:06:47):**  I've started cross breeding with some short horns, we were getting some pretty wild and  waspy waspy cows and finch jumpers and stuff that would chase you out.  And we have a pretty bad coyote problem.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:06:58):**  So we thought, you know, if a cow run me over, she'll definitely keep a coyote off of her  calf.  But then it kind of got a little excessive.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:07:05):**  So I started breeding some short horn in there to get that a little calmer her and it has  helped a bunch.  And we we start calving in April and May.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:07:15):**  I mean, it's like having efforts right now I pulled the calf about 30 minutes ago, but  then we we keep them until sometime in October when they're between 525 pounds 550 pounds.  We sell them through superior livestock, which is has worked pretty decent is working for  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:07:32):**  us, you know.  And you're selling through superior on a program.  Right?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:07:39):**  Yeah, so yep, yep, we were utilizing the beef chain program that we started.  And you want me to go into how that all came to be?  Let's hit it.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:07:49):**  That's why we're here, buddy.  I want to know we want to know all about beef chain, especially from a producer's perspective,  because every other person I have heard talk about beef chain is a crypto investor is a  
**[0:08:04-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:04):**  CEO, or is somebody that's being negative about it.  So I really, really want to hear a producer's perspective from the ground up at what it's  like and what it's doing for you.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:16):**  Yeah.  And for the listeners, it's similar to blockchain, right?  But in a beef context, is that what we're doing?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:26):**  I'll definitely explain all that.  So Wyoming started passing these blockchain laws because several years ago, when Bitcoin  was first becoming popular, I tried to buy some.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:37):**  And because I lived in the state of Wyoming, I couldn't.  And so the Wyoming legislators started coming up with these laws to make it a really friendly  place for blockchain companies to come and operate.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:48):**  And by the way, beef chain doesn't really utilize any of those laws.  Beef chain could have existed without these laws, but it brought some of our attention  to blockchain.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:08:59):**  So we started, my brother-in-law and my wife and I, we started looking into what blockchain  is.  My brother-in-law, he's a Wyoming representative.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:09:07):**  He's an expert on it.  He's the guy.  But we kind of learned what it was and what a blockchain is, is just a ledger of transactions.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:09:18):**  And so the thing that's so interesting about it, or so powerful about it, the technology  is once a transaction has made it onto the ledger, it cannot be altered ever.  And it's unhackable and I'll go into that later.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:09:33):**  But so we learned that blockchain is something that you could track cattle on.  And so then the end consumer, they're buying a stake.  Once blockchain becomes mainstream, if they understand it, they realize that this information  
**[0:09:49-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:09:49):**  has been on this ledger since this calf was born and has never been altered or changed.  So we thought this is a great way to track cattle, but people aren't going to buy a tag  from you just because you're going to attract a calf on a blockchain.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:00):**  We needed something else.  So that's when we went through the USDA and got a process verified program where we can  go and verify people's cattle that qualify their steer calves or whatever they're selling  
**[0:10:12-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:12):**  as, as all natural, meaning they receive no antibiotics, no growth hormones and agent  source verify them.  And we started a Wyoming plus program just because we're out of Wyoming.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:22):**  And that just verifies that their calves were born in Wyoming.  And so then they get an RFID tag for all their calves.  We order that for them.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:31):**  Is that just a normal 840 tag?  Yeah, they can do an 840 or whatever the 960 or whatever the other one is.  The benefits to using an 840 tag is you can also use it as a bangs tag, which has kind  
**[0:10:44-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:44):**  of become a big deal in Wyoming.  So we got our PVP programs and we're selling that to people because we were seeing if you  marketed your cattle as all natural, all these programs, you were getting at least 10 cents  
**[0:10:58-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:10:58):**  a pound or more, 10 cents a pound or more compared to people who didn't.  So we kind of learned that if you're not using a growth hormone program to get those extra  pounds, if you're not doing that and if you're keeping good records, you're basically leaving  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:11:15):**  money on the table by not using a program, by not marketing your cattle as not having  that hormone.  And if you're keeping the records where if I gave this calf an antibiotic, I can point  
**[0:11:24-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:11:24):**  that calf out because I've marked it in some sort of way and it's in my ranch logbook.  And that's one of the misconceptions people have about the all natural program is you  can't give antibiotics.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:11:34):**  You absolutely manage your cattle herd on you.  Organic, you can't give antibiotics, but once you do, they just go to a different market,  right?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:11:44):**  Yeah.  So if you do have to give something an antibiotic, you just have to have a way of marking it  with a different colored ear tag or a notch in the ear tag.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:11:52):**  And you have to put it down in your ranch logbook.  You know, I gave this calf five CCs of LA 200 and you send beef chain a picture of the  RFID tag and we take care of the rest for you.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:12:04):**  So that's how beef chain got started.  And then we've been working on a consumer facing product where you go to a restaurant,  you order your steak and it's going to come out with a QR code sticking in a little toothpicks.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:12:17):**  You can scan that QR code and it's going to bring up a landing page for that rancher and  it'll give you information.  The rancher has a pretty decent write up about the history of his ranch, what kind of things  
**[0:12:31-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:12:31):**  he's doing there, you know, family pictures, because all these ranches we work with, they're  family run operations.  And then he's got a nice video talking about why he does things the way he does.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:12:43):**  And then all of these transactions of that beef, you can go to a transaction page and  you can see when that animal was born, when it was shipped, when it was processed, and  when it showed up at your plate.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:12:57):**  And we've learned a lot doing that.  This is a pilot project and we've learned through some studies the University of Wyoming  did for us that 95% of people are willing to pay more for a steak if they knew where  
**[0:13:07-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:13:07):**  it came from and they know the history of it.  And something interesting I also learned, we kind of worked with a business professor  at UCLA and he said consumers also want to know that the rancher is getting his fair  
**[0:13:21-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:13:21):**  deal, he's getting his fair shake on that steak, which for the vast majority of ranchers  is not happening.  But if we can make a difference for guys that are selling direct to consumers, they're feeding  
**[0:13:35-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:13:35):**  them out and processing themselves and getting them in a steakhouse, then we can add value  to that.  And so then we're helping out ranchers and consumers.  
**[0:13:45-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:13:45):**  Right, so it's like Mike Calacrate said, ranchers used to get 70% of the dollar and now they're  getting less than 30%?  35, yeah, 34, 35 cents on the dollar, the consumer beef dollar I think is the figure  
**[0:14:02-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:02):**  he quoted.  That was episode four.  If anybody needs to go back and check that out, quote me on it.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:10):**  And so obviously we can't work with the big three packers because this is absolutely something  they're not interested in.  They like that supply chain being blurred.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:20):**  Absolutely.  So having to utilize privately owned custom slaughter facilities that are USDA certified  is the way we're having to go.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:29):**  But I don't know if your listeners probably know maybe a little bit about what's going  on with those three major packers and how they're buying meat from other countries and  selling it as labeled as product of the US because it was packaged in the US.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:44):**  Oh, let's talk about it.  Let's talk about why the big packers are definitely against things like beef chain and transparent  traceability.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:14:52):**  Well, in country of origin labeling too, right?  Yeah, so back when country origin labeling was around, it was a pretty decent deal.  We're getting good prices for our cattle, but these packers, they don't want you to  
**[0:15:10-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:15:10):**  know where it came from because it costs their investment money for a package.  You're not going to pay $4 or $5 for a package of burger if you know it came from Mexico  or South America.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:15:21):**  You don't know what are the regulations as far as withdrawal time for antibiotics in  those countries.  What parasites are they working with?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:15:30):**  What regulations do their facilities have?  But with their massive profits, I've got some numbers here like Tyson didn't make, but they  profited in 2020, $42.2 billion.  
**[0:15:45-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:15:45):**  And JBS is at $34.9 billion and Cargill's at $20 billion.  So that gives them just a massive amount of money to throw at lobbying.  JBS spent around over $7 million just in lobbying and they were able to land themselves a $900  
**[0:16:02-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:16:02):**  million government need contract.  So they're just so powerful that us little ranchers can't battle something that big.  And politicians don't want to touch it because these packers have become so efficient at  
**[0:16:17-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:16:17):**  processing beef and getting it out across the United States, out across the country.  They're so efficient they don't want to mess with the food chain plus their lobbying powers  and it's just become a horrible ordeal for us ranchers.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:16:34):**  And they've also been able to keep beef prices low because of their extreme consolidation.  In 1960, a pound of beef cost $6.97 and in 2019 it cost $5.80.  I can't think of anything else that has remained that low of a price in that time.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:16:54):**  What did a pickup cost in 1960 and what did a gallon of fuel cost in 1960?  I bet you could buy a gallon of fuel with your pocket change back then.  And what would an hour of labor or what would a day helper cost you in 1960 versus what  
**[0:17:09-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:17:09):**  it cost you today?  Absolutely.  You know, those are some serious problems that those of us in production agriculture,  
**[0:17:19-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:17:19):**  we've had to deal with for the last, you know, 60, I guess it has been 60 years since  1968 can do math on all those fingers.  So I used to work for a boutique packer, the hunter, they killed 1000 cows a day.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:17:35):**  And they would say that their argument against country of origin labeling is, you know, because  we were in California, they would ship in Mexican steers, and then they would have them  for 120 days.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:17:48):**  Right.  And so they're like, well, you know, it's really about the finishing product.  And so that was the argument for against it.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:17:54):**  Right.  And I'm still thinking, but 90% of its life was in Mexico.  We don't really know what kind of forage or whatever else they got.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:18:05):**  Yeah.  But you know, that's a problem that the beef chain is right now at a small level.  We're not taking on any major package right now, but we're trying to solve it with traceability  
**[0:18:18-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:18:18):**  through blockchain technology.  So something I know a lot of ranchers and producers are concerned about, especially  with my involvement with Pasture Map over the years is how secure is my data?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:18:31):**  How secure is my data and how can I make sure that my data for these EID tags and the cattle  movement isn't being used against me?  Exactly.  
**[0:18:46-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:18:46):**  So I use different I use the different program before before we started the chain.  I was pretty sure they were collecting information about like what what antibiotics I was using.  And they were able to sell that data, you know, targets, you know, to do some marketing  
**[0:19:01-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:19:01):**  and I when we started this, I said, I'm not interested in that.  This is just charge a flat rate to ranchers.  We're not going to make money if they make more money.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:19:11):**  We make money because they're our returned customer.  And so and another thing that ranchers worry about along those same lines is they don't  want all their public.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:19:19):**  They don't want all their information on a public blockchain.  They don't want what they're selling them for, how many they've got on there.  So they just what I tell them is the only information that goes on the blockchain is  
**[0:19:31-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:19:31):**  that CAF's RFID tag number and whatever certifications they have.  It's created kind of technical terms, it's created into a hash and that's what's on a  blockchain.  
**[0:19:42-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:19:42):**  They're not going to know things like how much you sold that CAF per pound, or if you  processed it, what you're charging for ribeyes or something like that.  I think that there's a lot of concerns that I've heard that probably won't come to fruition  
**[0:20:03-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:20:03):**  like is the government going to be tracking my cows?  I don't think we're ever going to have to worry about that.  Yeah, so we do get audited every year by the USDA because this is the USDA program and  
**[0:20:14-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:20:14):**  they have to make sure we're doing things right.  But the USDA cannot come to us and say I want a list of every rancher that you are utilizing  or that's using your program and a tag manifest of all our calves and all the information  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:20:28):**  you have on.  They can't legally do that.  They would have to go get a warrant or something like that.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:20:32):**  They can't just show up and demand that information.  And we damn sure wouldn't give it to them without a fight.  We're ranchers ourselves and that's not our cup of tea.  
**[0:20:46-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:20:46):**  And the data is all encrypted and unless the data owner gives you a key or a piece of a  key, you cannot read data off that blockchain, correct?  Yeah, so this information, unless you're wanting it shared like this rancher that we're using  
**[0:21:03-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:21:03):**  where he's got the QR code and those transactions have been tracked, the QR code shows what  this animal is certified in.  But it's only if somebody wants it shared.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:21:18):**  If you're doing some sort of marketing like he is where he's trying to prove or show the  life of this cattle from where it was born until it gets to your plate.  But as far as ever being able to change any of that information or look it up, all this  
**[0:21:35-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:21:35):**  blockchain stuff is really protected by mathematics.  It's not necessarily like an internet is a server is protected by a firewall and if you  can give the firewall a virus then you're into that server.  
**[0:21:49-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:21:49):**  This is all decentralized.  So I mean I can get into that if you'd like to kind of help explain to people.  The more you can explain things from a boots on the ground producer level, the more we  
**[0:22:03-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:03):**  like it.  Okay, so if we all remember 2008, the recession, things weren't going great.  Not quite as bad as what we're dealing with now but there was problems with the dollar.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:17):**  And so some people that we don't know, we don't know who they are started this Bitcoin.  They use the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  We don't know if it's one person or a group of people but as advanced as this is, it was  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:30):**  probably a group of people.  So they started Bitcoin and they literally, the first thing ever sold on their ledger  was a pizza.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:39):**  Somebody bought a pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins which would be, I don't know, whatever 10,000  times 50,000 is right now.  A big pile of money.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:47):**  The world's most expensive pizza.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:22:52):**  So they developed this program and they wanted to keep it decentralized and part of the reason  of keeping it decentralized is so one person or one entity or one group could not have  a massive amount of control of this and it also makes it so there's no central point  
**[0:23:07-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:23:07):**  to where this can be hacked because it's run by, at the beginning it was run by anybody  with a computer that wanted to get involved.  And so like I said before, this is all based on mathematics and these big huge digits that  
**[0:23:21-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:23:21):**  are 256 numbers long.  But anyway, they created Bitcoin.  There's only 21 million Bitcoins that are ever going to exist.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:23:31):**  So they kind of used the gold standard to base value on it.  So it's not like the American dollar where we need some more, let's just print some more.  There's a finite amount of it.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:23:41):**  And another thing that brings value to a cryptocurrency is its use case.  So if a credit card company decides it wants all of its transactions to be tracked on a  blockchain so they're not having to have a warehouse full of computer servers that they  
**[0:23:57-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:23:57):**  maintain and pay for and has the vulnerability of being hacked or shut down.  They can have a blockchain do this for them for a fee.  And I'm kind of losing my place here on all this.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:24:11):**  So I can go back to how a blockchain works.  I'm kind of getting sidetracked here.  So the way a blockchain works is there's a transaction that happens and these are happening  
**[0:24:21-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:24:21):**  now they're happening thousands per second.  These transactions are put into a pool and these are called unconfirmed transactions.  So then we'll use Bitcoin's blockchain as an example.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:24:33):**  So all the people who have nodes, these are small little computers.  Their only purpose is running this system.  There's a huge map algorithm problem that they have to solve in order to win the right

And these map problems are huge, 256 numbers long.  It takes something, these computers are all racing to solve this answer.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:25:02):**  It takes like 10 minutes for them to solve it.  So the winner who solves the math transaction shares that work with all the other nodes  on the system.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:25:12):**  They all verify that that's correct.  And then these transactions are all then put on a ledger.  All the miners and the nodes verify that these transactions are valid and then it goes on  
**[0:25:23-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:25:23):**  a ledger.  And so Bitcoin's right now, they're doing something like 9,000 transactions per second.  So that helps make this highly unhackable, but also because it's so decentralized.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:25:41):**  So then the transactions are on the ledger.  Now let's say you want to buy some Bitcoin.  So you have to open up some sort of a mobile app like Coinbase or something like that.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:25:53):**  And that creates what's called a wallet for you, which is basically like an account.  It's a wallet.  And you're going to buy some Bitcoin from somebody.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:26:00):**  So when you buy it from them, you're sending them the address for your wallet.  And there's a public key and a private key involved in that.  These are things you don't have to know when you're doing this.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:26:10):**  It's all done automatically for you.  But then that person sends you whatever you want to keep your address safe so that somebody  can't just do the reverse mathematics and get into it.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:26:22):**  All of these are protected by what's called elliptical curve cryptography.  And so elliptical curve cryptography, multiplication is pretty straightforward, but to do the reverse  to get your address and get into your wallet is division, and that's almost impossible  
**[0:26:44-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:26:44):**  on an elliptical curve because you're having to literally guess every single permutation  of a digit that's 256 numbers long, which would literally take tens of thousands of  years for a computer to do.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:26:59):**  I'll take your word for it.  I barely got out of algebra.  That's why things on a blockchain are so well protected.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:27:09):**  It's ironclad locked in there is because of mathematics.  And this is a pretty advanced mathematics stuff.  So what beef chain did was say, let's say I've got a bunch of calves that are all natural  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:27:23):**  and I've got one that's not.  Somebody down the line can't buy that calf and say, I'm going to go ahead and market  this as all natural.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:27:29):**  I'm going to go in there and change that and say, this thing never got LA 200.  It's all natural.  It's not possible.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:27:34):**  So the consumer knows this animal is antibiotic free.  As long as that information was put in there truthfully in the first place.  And so some people argue that, you know, Bitcoin is now using massive amounts of electricity,  
**[0:27:51-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:27:51):**  what they, which they are.  So the blockchain company that we have teamed up with or hit our wagon to is it's called  IOHK.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:28:00):**  They're rebranding the name to IOG input output global.  Their blockchain is called Cardano and it's called a proof of stake blockchain.  And so what that means is anybody who has a computer can download what's called the  
**[0:28:14-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:28:14):**  dataless app, which is what runs their, their blockchain.  You buy some of their tokens and then you, it's called staking.  You stake their tokens to a staking pool.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:28:24):**  These staking pools are people that own the mining nodes or just the miners.  Your computer then becomes a node and instead of your computer or a node having to burn  up all this electricity and power to try to win the right to mine a block.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:28:39):**  One of your tokens is just drawn.  It's kind of like a lottery.  So if your token is drawn that belongs to you out of what you've staked, then whoever  
**[0:28:48-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:28:48):**  you've staked with then mines those transactions.  So it just uses a really finite amount of the of electricity and anybody can get involved.  You can go buy a hundred dollars, $50 of this token and you can be a node on Cardano system.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:29:05):**  So it's even more decentralized.  Do the producers need to have, do the producers that are participating in block in beef chain  need to be a part of the Cardano network with a node?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:29:16):**  Nope.  They, they don't have to do, they don't have to do anything at all like that.  You know, as of right now, because we're just starting out, we're just literally, the USDA  
**[0:29:29-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:29:29):**  requires us to keep all of this information, RFID tags and certifications that they're  in a safe place.  It's either a computer server or they've allowed us to use the blockchain because it's even  
**[0:29:39-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:29:39):**  more safe than an internet server.  So ranchers don't necessarily, to be involved, you maybe need to have an email address for  us to get this going for you.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:29:55):**  So smartphone not required.  Yeah, you don't necessarily have to have a smartphone or anything.  We can literally mail you an application, you fill it out.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:05):**  We do it all over the phone, set you up with when your tags are going to show up.  You let us know when all the tags are in their ears.  We come out and do an onsite audit.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:13):**  If, if you're doing all the programs, if you're just doing source and aid verified, that's  just over the phone and then we come out, we do an audit.  And when I was audited before by different companies, it felt pretty invasive.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:26):**  So I've tried my best to make sure it's not that way.  I really explain things like, have you given a calf LA 200 and what's your protocol for  marking that?  
**[0:30:36-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:36):**  If they say, yeah, I gave this one LA 200 and I gave it a pink ear tag, I'm going to  need to see that that's in your log book and see that calf to verify that.  And it's not that we don't trust these ranchers.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:49):**  That's it's the name of the game.  We are third party verification.  So we have to verify that.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:30:53):**  Yeah, there, there has to be some spot checking to keep everybody honest.  Yep, definitely.  Because if you send a spear to a packer that's been, that has antibiotics and hasn't been  
**[0:31:05-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:31:05):**  injection site and people have paid more for the animal because it's all natural, there's,  there's going to be hell to pay after that.  So is beef chain a cryptocurrency and how is it different from a cryptocurrency?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:31:24):**  So beef chain, we do not have like a token or a cryptocurrency right now.  And I can go into what cryptocurrencies are.  So these, these nodes that are all mining these transactions and doing the work.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:31:35):**  Once a, once a block has been forged and all the transactions are on it right now, I think  Bitcoin pays 6.25 Bitcoins per block.  So if your, if your, if your nodes work on that block, you get a percentage of those  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:31:49):**  Bitcoins.  That's how they're paid.  So you can see if there's more use cases for a blockchain and more of this money is going  
**[0:31:56-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:31:56):**  out the door to these people that brings more value to it because there's less of it, less  of it in, what am I trying to say?  There's less of it available.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:32:08):**  Less of it in circulation.  Limited quantity.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:32:11):**  So right now, like we know each other through TikTok and because of my videos and hashtagging  cryptocurrency in this, there are literally probably thousands of people that are talking  about cryptocurrency.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:32:25):**  They bring up their graphs and they say, this coin is doing awesome.  And they talk about the candles and the dips and all this, this chart talking, you know,  head and shoulders here and a flag that means that the coins are going to do this.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:32:37):**  But there's so many of these tokens that, that have no use case and they have no limited  supply, but they're just going through the roof because of all the hype.  I guarantee you there's a bunch of those tokens that will not be here any year and people  
**[0:32:51-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:32:51):**  are making money on it, which is great.  You go buy like doge coin is one you hear a lot about.  I think they make 500 million of those a year and they're going to do it every year and  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:02):**  people buy them up the next day.  It's gone up in value.  They sell them.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:06):**  Well, they just might as well be the federal reserve at that point, if they're going to  keep printing them at that rate.  And so there's, there's people now because of the hype of this, they're making it to  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:16):**  token.  That's a scam.  They're selling it to you and then they're just going to disappear and you'll hold this  
**[0:33:23-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:23):**  token that has zero value.  And that's really going to hurt the Bitcoin industry when a bunch of people, not the Bitcoin,  the blockchain industry, when a bunch of people get left holding a bag of worthless tokens.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:34):**  I mean, my personal belief is that the value of all cryptocurrency is intrinsically zero,  but it's what we can do with that blockchain that powers cryptocurrency, that that's where  the value is for me.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:51):**  Okay, exactly.  Exactly.  You know, this, some of these that are just hype coins that aren't worth anything, they're  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:33:59):**  not doing anything.  They're not creating a value.  People are going to get bitten by those, but these ones like Cordano, they have a bunch  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:07):**  of use cases.  They're actually doing things.  Those are the ones that have value, you know, that company is going to be around it and  
**[0:34:13-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:13):**  Tinder for now and the coin is going to go up.  And what they're doing with the technology, in my opinion, is, is more important than  than the coin itself.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:22):**  You know, Bitcoin is worth a bunch of money, but it's, it's worth that because of what  their technology is able to do.  And when you, Brian, do you have any Bitcoin?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:34):**  I do, I have some Bitcoin.  You guys do?  Can I read a text?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:38):**  My friend, my ranger friend in Missouri who really wants me to buy Bitcoin.  I'm going to read it because it made me laugh, but now I'm maybe, maybe he makes sense.  He says, there's a chance for it to fail still, but right now it looks like the best it ever  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:34:54):**  has.  I'm not scolding you.  I'm trying to inform you so if something big happens, I don't have the guilt of not telling  
**[0:35:00-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:35:00):**  you.  And that, I mean, that I feel like is kind of the, how everyone else is saying invest  in Bitcoin and this cryptocurrency because it's, it's gonna, it's going to be the real  
**[0:35:13-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:35:13):**  deal.  I passed on some Bitcoins in, I think it was 2006 or 2007.  There was an MMO character that, that I was playing that I was like trying to get rid  
**[0:35:24-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:35:24):**  of and I needed money to pay bills and this guy was offering me the equivalent of 450  bucks in Bitcoin and I think they were like, they were less than 20 cents.  I think they're between six and 20 cents each at the time and it was $450 worth of Bitcoin,  
**[0:35:42-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:35:42):**  but Bitcoin doesn't buy groceries in 2009 so I had to take some cash and believe me,  I wish I would have taken at least half of it in Bitcoin.  But yeah, that would be, that'd be, that you'd have 22, that'd be 2000 some odd Bitcoin right  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:02):**  now.  That's a lot of money.  But, so this isn't in any way financial advice, but the old saying, when's the best time to  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:10):**  plant an apple tree?  And that was 20 years ago.  20 years ago.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:13):**  That's the second best time is right now.  So there's, there's lots of people that have become billionaires from Bitcoin because they  bought it in 2009 or 10.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:23):**  But you know, my opinion of it, like this isn't advice, is that Bitcoin, the most it's  going to do now is probably in this year, the next two years is double in price.  So the best you could do is double your money on it.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:35):**  There are some other ones out there like, like Cardano that I feel could go up to, it's  trading right now to like a dollar 30 a token.  It could get up to $5.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:45):**  I don't know if it will, but that's, that's kind of what people smarter than me are saying.  So there's some money to be there.  And plus you can, I forgot to mention this part about the staking.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:36:55):**  When you stake on Cardano's network, because you're helping run the network with your computer  being a noted stake, you get paid rewards also.  So you can get paid up to, you know, around 3, 6, 10% interest on what you stake.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:37:11):**  So you get, it's passive income.  But I do think it's, it's probably here to stay.  I don't know how much government regulation will come into it.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:37:20):**  Like I said, the best thing you can do is do a bunch of research.  A lot of this can be kind of hard to understand, but if a coin has a use case that's a use  for it and it has a different date, they have white papers and those can be boring and hard  
**[0:37:36-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:37:36):**  to read too.  But there are some people on TikTok that I think are giving great advice on tokens to  buy.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:37:46):**  But then there's a bunch of them that are horrible.  But yeah, I think it's definitely here.  The thing that'll happen now is, you know, I got into Bitcoin a while ago, so right now  
**[0:37:56-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:37:56):**  I'm super happy where it's at.  It's bouncing around from 60,000 down to 50,000.  I don't really care, but somebody that bought it 56,000 and now it's down to 50,000 is just  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:38:09):**  mashing their teeth.  They're having a bad day.  I think it'll go up and they'll be fine.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:38:15):**  It's one of those things you buy it and you can't look at it every day.  Look at it every month and see where it's at.  Great.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:38:26):**  We had some questions from the Ranching Reboot Paddock.  The first one we want to get to is our good friend Jeff Goodwin, who was last week's episode.  Jeff asked, how are the major retail sector companies going to overcome their mass balance  
**[0:38:42-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:38:42):**  approach with traceability through blockchain?  So you know, right now Walmart is using blockchain to track their leafy greens and some other  vegetables.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:38:57):**  And the reason they're partially doing that is because of that salmon outbreak we had  a couple of years ago.  And you know, it made a lot of people sick.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:39:03):**  I think it took them six or seven days to track that back to where it originated from.  But with blockchain technology, they've tested this and it literally took two and a half  seconds to track something back to where it originated from.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:39:17):**  So instead of having to clear every shelf across the country and cost them who knows  how much, they can just go to just those stores that are contaminated and clear just those  and keeps people from getting sick or dying.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:39:31):**  Or trace the blockchain back to the source of contamination and then go back up and get  all the products from there even if they went to other stores without doing a mass recall,  pulling everything off at every Walmart shelf in the country.  
**[0:39:46-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:39:46):**  Exactly and you know, GBS a couple years ago had a huge recall where they recalled like  12 million pounds of beef and they got less than 2% of that back just because they're  throwing it out the door so quick.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:40:01):**  It's almost impossible to track from there.  So Michael Kinsey wants to know again from the Ranching Reboot Paddock, how does blockchain  in the commodity beef market not lead to corporate takeover like Packers maintaining their own  
**[0:40:18-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:40:18):**  independent Ledgers?  Well, that's a pretty good question.  For a Packer to be involved and want to have their own ledger, that's a really good question.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:40:36):**  Partially because this is producer led, they're controlling their information, they could  potentially dictate who they're selling to.  And I've honestly never been asked that question before.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:40:58):**  But I will have to give that one some thought.  Yeah, if you think of something we can always definitely circle back to that.  Michael's a smart guy.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:41:09):**  He asked really good questions.  So the last one we had from the paddock for you, it's kind of a two-parter of some Will  Haynes and he asked, does beef chain honor third-party certifications from other auditors?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:41:23):**  For example, if he bought NHTC calves and wanted to add them to beef chain, what does  that look like?  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:41:34):**  It would just be if he's wanting to certify them as if he wants to add to his certifications  because they've used a USDA certified PDP program that's pretty easy to step into.  And to extend on to that, we also certify feedlots.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:41:55):**  So it's not just for the rancher.  Obviously, it's got to continue down the chain.  And probably sale barns as well for those of us that don't like to do with superior.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:06):**  Superior is not the best option.  Yep, we do.  We deal with sale barns also.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:14):**  So I've got a box of 840 tags and a pen of pears.  Where do I start?  What's the onboarding process look like?  
**[0:42:23-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:23):**  So you can go to beefchain.com.  It's beefchain.com.  We're actually working on that to make a button where you just push application.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:35):**  Or you can get on to beefchain.com and just contact us.  We will send you out an application either through email or if you want it in the mail.  And you can read through that and that'll kind of give you an idea of whether or not  
**[0:42:47-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:47):**  you're going to be able to qualify.  If you keep records of when your first calf was born, when the last calf of that season  was born, do you record doctoring records, antibiotics and stuff?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:42:59):**  Do you use hormones?  Some people use cedars for AI purposes.  Are those stored in a safe place?  
**[0:43:09-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:09):**  Some of these questions are required by the USDA.  Obviously you don't have cedars laying out on your deck.  I do.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:16):**  I totally do.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:19):**  You fill out an application that'll give you a pretty good idea.  Go ahead and if you already have your own tags, put them in their ear, send us a tag  manifest.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:31):**  Then we'll schedule an audit.  Somebody will come out and go through this list of questions.  It maybe takes five minutes if we don't send BS too much.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:39):**  That audit will go to a level one reviewer, then a level two reviewer.  If there's no issues, you'll get a shipping certificate in the mail.  So then when you go to sell your cattle or ship them or whatever, that just goes on to  
**[0:43:52-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:43:52):**  the next buyer.  What's got to go to the next person is obviously the tag manifest and the shipping certificate  which says these cattle are certified by USDA PVP in all natural or NHTC or whatever.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:44:11):**  Besides the cost of the tags and the EID equipment, what are producers' costs to participate  in the beef chain program?  So to do the full gamut for us to come and do an audit is going to cost you $1200.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:44:30):**  I was waiting for you to follow up with a then.  Well I've actually got a little dealer I can pull up and give you the exact numbers  of everything.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:44:41):**  I mean I guess what we're getting at is, is it a significant cost burden?  Is it a yearly reoccurring thing?  And then of course where we want to go with that is what kind of premiums can we expect  
**[0:44:58-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:44:58):**  as producers from this system currently and as it develops.  We've got to make sure that the premiums are definitely going to offset the cost.  So yeah it costs for everything about $2 a tag and then if there is no onsite audit required  
**[0:45:16-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:45:16):**  there's no other chart.  If you have an onsite audit that's $1200 whether you have a 1000 head or 200 head.  So then you have to renew every year or if you have two different calving groups, if  
**[0:45:32-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:45:32):**  you calve in the spring and you calve in the fall both those groups have to be audited  and certified.  But it is a reoccurring deal every year.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:45:46):**  When you sign up with Beef Chain we send you a ranch manual and it will have a bunch at  the back of it, it will have a bunch of things that you can utilize like a doctoring record  where you can write down the dates and what you doctored and how much.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:45:58):**  We help you get your feed letters if you feed mineral tubs or something you have to get  a hold of the manufacturer to make sure there weren't any things USDA doesn't like in there  on the forager things like that.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:46:10):**  And we help you do all that.  There's a page in there for pasture moves.  So if you move from the south pasture to these pastures it makes it easy to fill up.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:46:22):**  Then when it comes time to audit just plop that down in front of your auditor you can  go through it right there and try to make it as easy as possible.  Most ranchers have found if you keep decent records this is super easy to do.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:46:37):**  I know guy.  So you mentioned move records.  Like some of us move three herds every day or some of us move one herd five, six times  
**[0:46:50-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:46:50):**  a day.  What kind of move records do you guys really want?  Well so the move records just help to bear it's a way of verifying that those cattle  
**[0:47:01-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:47:01):**  are on your ranch.  It's just a way of verifying the source part of it.  So if you're staying in the same pasture and you're doing rotational grazing just just  
**[0:47:13-0:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:47:13):**  right now when you move out of that pasture or something to the next one you could say  you could say something as simple as I was in this section of land from this date to  this date.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:47:25):**  I mean it doesn't have to be super super specific like that like move cows into this  paddock then five hours later they have that off so I move them again.  I can imagine there's a software company out there that probably has an API that would  
**[0:47:42-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:47:42):**  that would interface with that and make that a little bit easier of a process.  What do you think CK?  Okay so Drew I work for Pashmark if you didn't plug that in already so grazing management  
**[0:47:53-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:47:53):**  software but we talked about pivoting two years ago so we're like okay what is what's  the next steps for Pashmark as a business and so now we're in the carbon market right  but I wanted to do the QR code that was I was like we need to do blockchain QR codes  
**[0:48:08-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:48:08):**  we have some data we'll just enhance the data for ranchers and then they could do the natural  programs because what it opens up to European markets in and the ranchers are seeing what  did you say 10 cents per pound added and what does that feel like a whole for a whole animal  
**[0:48:25-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:48:25):**  like it's like two 250 dollars or.  Yeah so if you if you are not using these these programs and you're selling like yeah  500 pounds if you use the programs like last year you were you're bumping up to nine hundred  
**[0:48:44-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:48:44):**  dollars an animal if if they weigh 525 pounds if not you know you could have broke even  in our area you've got to sell a cap that's 550 pounds around 850 dollars you got to get  from the break even so the more you can add to that you know that's that's how guys get  
**[0:49:03-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:49:03):**  to go on vacation and put their kids through college or actually ranch full time and quit  their outside job your wife doesn't have to have two jobs in town yeah.  So right now the premium you said was about 10 cents 10 cents a pound do you expect that  
**[0:49:21-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:49:21):**  to go up?  You know with with the surveys that we have the University of Wyoming has done with this  there is a big increase in people wanting to know where their beef came from and you  
**[0:49:35-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:49:35):**  know it used to be that 99 percent of the population made their living in agriculture  and one percent was was urban people and that was cool it flipped flop.  So but people are becoming more conscious conscious eaters and wanting to know where  
**[0:49:50-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:49:50):**  it came from and not just know where it came from but be educated in it and understand  it and we're seeing a big influx in that and in Wyoming you know there's farmers markets  opening up all over the place because they can look the people in the eye that raised  
**[0:50:04-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:50:04):**  the animal and know more about it and we're just seeing that that's that's becoming more  popular to know where you're to know where your food came from because these people have  been lied to before you go to Whole Foods a couple years ago or wherever it was they

**[0:50:29-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:50:29):**  Absolutely.  So I see I see the value increasing in it as more people want to become educated you  know once they learn we're not all trying to poison and kill them we're just trying  
**[0:50:39-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:50:39):**  to sell the best beef we possibly can and get get more of them onto our side then they're  going to want to learn more and be willing to pay more to know where it came from and  the dream is to someday somebody goes to a grocery store and they're there to buy a particular  
**[0:50:56-0:51:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:50:56):**  ranch and beef or they go to a particular restaurant because it's serving this particular  guy's steak that's his favorite versus last week it was so-and-so steak not so much my  favorite but gets his buddies his favorite and and that's that's the brand loyalty this  
**[0:51:16-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:51:16):**  this niche marketing where you you know it's people have their favorite kind of whiskey  or or whatever let's let's have your favorite kind of you're not just your favorite kind  of beef but your favorite region it was raged in or whatever ranchers have to get out of  
**[0:51:32-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:51:32):**  the mindset that beef is a commodity and start marketing it as a as a well like how they  want it like why can you twirl wines where you know you have the estate or you have the  non-estate the state means actually will raise where they live or in this region yeah  
**[0:51:53-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:51:53):**  and what we have learned is it might be a hard pill for ranchers to swallow to change  their operation but in the whiskey industry you know Jack Daniels has its Jack Daniels  whiskey you go buy at their liquor store that maybe makes them some money maybe doesn't  
**[0:52:07-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:52:07):**  but then they have their Jack Daniels select or special reserve that costs a lot more that's  only about 10% of what they sell but that's what makes them their profit so if a rancher  was to say I'm gonna retain ownership of 10% of my herd I'm gonna feed them out and I'm  
**[0:52:22-0:52:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:52:22):**  gonna sell the beef myself they're gonna make possibly more money than that than selling  to the sale bar and that might be a hard pill to swallow or something hard to transition  into but it's kind of looking the way that the rancher is gonna have to to do to make  
**[0:52:38-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:52:38):**  money and if if we're there to help them pull their hand through it it won't be so tough.  The math certainly shows that a producer doesn't have to direct market self-finish and direct  market very many animals to really really make a difference on his bottom line especially  
**[0:52:57-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:52:57):**  if he keeps the feedlot and the packer out of it.  Absolutely yeah if you can you know beef chain is working towards what I want to do someday  that's definitely what we're working towards is I've got a notebook over here full of restaurants  
**[0:53:12-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:53:12):**  that are wanting steak that where they know that came from and I've got a notebook here  of ranchers that got that steak and depending on what you want I make the connections.  If this restaurant only wants grass-fed grass-finished beef it's like all right I've got this rancher  
**[0:53:27-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:53:27):**  here this is how much he's charging for 20 loins per pound.  And it's not just for the grass-fed products or you know you guys are also tracing the  good fits yeah you're also tracing the typical you know feedlot corn-fed beef as well right?  
**[0:53:47-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:53:47):**  Yeah if a restaurant says we want it aged we want it grain finished and aged for 30  days it's like all right I got a guy for that I got a guy who's doing that here he is here's  this phone number or here's what he's charging we'll set you up with the QR code and everything  
**[0:54:03-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:54:03):**  and that's that's the end game.  That's such a good idea.  Here's the data to prove that he's got what he says he's got.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:54:12):**  Here's the data that backs up his claims because of the way a blockchain works that data has  never been able to be altered or changed.  So trying to give the consumer the peace of mind that if I'm going to go pay $60 for a  
**[0:54:27-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:54:27):**  steak because it has these claims the camcorder better have those claims.  So let's see what that wow I'll probably forget to edit that out later.  Let's shift gears a little bit here and let's talk about let's talk about a few other things  
**[0:54:47-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:54:47):**  I think we kind of and you really covered beef chain and blockchain I'm I think I got  about all my questions answered that I had about that.  CK did you have anything?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:54:57):**  She's got barking dogs.  One thing I'll add before you skip is this blockchain stuff is it does sound complicated  but the more videos you watch on YouTube or something the more you read about it all of  
**[0:55:10-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:55:10):**  a sudden the lights will flip off in your head and you'll get it and you'll wonder  why we weren't doing this stuff 20 years ago and it's we basically had to wait for  technology to come up with to catch up with this idea.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:55:19):**  This idea has been around for decades but yeah you'll people will get it just do a little  research I mean if a dumb hillbilly rancher like me got it.  I love it though we make jokes internally at PastureMam like we make fun of blockchain  
**[0:55:33-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:55:33):**  because we're like no one gets it it's not a real thing but honestly it sounds like you  guys have figured it out so that's amazing.  So like I said to shift gears here a little bit what are some of the resources in schools  
**[0:55:50-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:55:50):**  that have really helped you out in your ranching career?  Well I don't have a college degree which is everybody else involved in beef chain except  for Tyler Lindholm one of our founders they've all got big long letters behind their name  
**[0:56:05-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:56:05):**  but I don't have any of that but you know obviously my dad helping me out a lot with  learning how to ranch and we kind of did things at first when it wasn't popular because it  made business sense you know it used to be big cows raised big calves big calves making  
**[0:56:21-0:56:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:56:21):**  more money but then when you put a pencil to it it costs a hell of a lot less to feed  a 1100 1200 pound cow through the winter and if you do your breeding program right and  she raises 550 pound calf you're making more money.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:56:35):**  So things like that as far as helping with beef chain the University of Wyoming has reached  out and helped us quite a bit I have a meeting every day with this guy named Cory Billington  who he's worked for Heineken Hewlett-Packard he's at 3,000 people working under him he's  
**[0:56:52-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:56:52):**  the business professor there I think he's literally a business professor there because  he was bored and he just wanted to help so that's an absolute wealth of knowledge in  all this Washington State is trying to help us out.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:57:05):**  I was on a meeting the other day with the business professor at UCLA the head business  professor there he's the one who actually brought up that consumers wanted to know that  ranchers are getting their fair share which I guess I had never even considered that.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:57:20):**  Luxembourg University just reached out to us and I did which is in Germany I was a keynote  speaker at a blockchain week that they have which when I initially agreed to do that I  did not know it was that big of a deal.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:57:36):**  Oh really?  How funny.  Yeah luckily it was all done over video but okay two o'clock in the afternoon there which  
**[0:57:44-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:57:44):**  was six in the morning here and I had been up till about four in the morning calving  heifers so it was it was nerve-wracking but luckily some of the speakers weren't too it  was kind of boring so I was able to knock their socks off with some of this information  
**[0:57:59-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:57:59):**  about the packers and you know a package of bird could have a hundred different cattle  in it and stuff like that.  These dirty little secrets of the meat packing industry that nobody wants to talk about.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:58:11):**  That's what they don't want to admit that's why they exactly like we like it because it's  easy just throw them all in the same bin.  But you know education wise as far as myself just reading every article you can in different  
**[0:58:25-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:58:25):**  ranch magazines and trying to separate the bullshit from the facts and what makes sense  and what doesn't.  You know learning about crossbreeding your cattle and how that can be beneficial and  
**[0:58:37-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:58:37):**  ways to graze and there's a guy on TikTok that a lot of people really tear down I think  it's he's an Oregon sisters cattle company or something is his name.  We've met.  
**[0:58:49-0:59:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:58:49):**  I don't think people necessarily agree with this.  People don't necessarily agree with his politics or anything like that but if you can't watch  that guy and learn something about soil and grasses I mean what are you doing?  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:02):**  There's some knowledge there.  We actually picked Hobbs.  I did.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:08):**  The CK went along with it.  We picked Hobbs for episode one because I thought he was the perfect spokesman to kick  off a podcast.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:17):**  That guy is just.  It's got the tone.  Yeah he's really well spoken and articulate.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:23):**  He can really defend his points.  He definitely can and I see people tearing him down and it's like I'm not sure where  he is politically and it doesn't really matter to me but I can sit there and listen to a  
**[0:59:36-0:59:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:36):**  minute long video and learn something about grass or soil.  It's worth it.  I'll do it.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:44):**  Definitely and he's doing a lot to educate and well the gentleman that we asked a question  from the Paddock earlier, Michael Kinsey, he was on the second episode and he's off  in Georgia and he's doing some really neat things too.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=0:59:58):**  Reverend Wild Ranch, that's what he is on TikTok.  So what's the biggest challenge you're facing right now?  Well you know the blockchain technology is so new and it's kind of scaring people.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:00:18):**  They only know about Bitcoin if they've heard of anything at all and thinking that they're  going to sell their calves for Bitcoin.  That's what they're going to get or just educating people has been the biggest challenge.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:00:30):**  Like I said before, ranchers think if you're doing all natural they cannot get hormones  or not hormones I'm sorry antibiotics which is not the case.  You can.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:00:40):**  You just got to make sure they're tracked and logged.  Yeah and so we're doing this pilot project where I worked on getting a rancher that sells  direct consumers signed up and then get a restaurant that wants to serve as beef.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:00:55):**  So the biggest hurdles were explaining blockchain technology and there's been some people come  out of the woodwork service, a lawyer off an accounting speaker in Newcastle said this  is all communist run, beef chains all communist and obviously he's never met me or talked  
**[1:01:10-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:01:10):**  to me or anybody involved.  But getting past the hurdles of this new scary technology and this new currency that just  because I'm involved in this doesn't mean I think or want Bitcoin to take over the dollar  
**[1:01:25-1:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:01:25):**  as far as our currency.  I'm a patriotic American.  I want the dollar to be doing well but the way they're printing it and valuing it is  
**[1:01:33-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:01:33):**  kind of scary to me so I want to invest in something that's fine.  So just educating people on that technology so I got my rancher signed up and talking  to restaurants was almost impossible to get a hold of an owner of a restaurant that you  
**[1:01:50-1:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:01:50):**  you're not associated with or don't know.  I mean I called the restaurants in Portland, Oregon, Aspen, Colorado, Boulder, Wickenburg,  Arizona, Jackson Hole, Wyoming and just getting to where I could talk to somebody high up  
**[1:02:03-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:02:03):**  in that restaurant was almost impossible but I finally got a list of the top 10 steakhouses  in Wyoming and one that was pretty close to us that I enjoy myself was on that list and  I heard through the grapevine that they are wanting a new meat supplier because I think  
**[1:02:20-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:02:20):**  they use Cisco had had sold them some kind of crappy beef that you know all these restaurants  are coming back online so the packers are kind of falling behind so they're killing  it and cutting it up while it's still jiggling and throwing it out the door and maybe there's  
**[1:02:35-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:02:35):**  some things that shouldn't end up in your restaurant that's maybe not graded correctly  but they want a new supplier so I went and talked to them and explained it to them.  If I could get down and explain it to people then it's not so scary that they're sitting  
**[1:02:48-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:02:48):**  face to face with the CEO of the company and I'm not a communist and if I can get their  ear for a minute I can kind of put their mind at ease at it but that's been the biggest  challenge as far as beefing.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:03:00):**  Well great, so what's been your biggest fail in your ranching career and what did it teach  you?  The biggest fail would probably be wishful thinking that we're going to have good ranch  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:03:17):**  every year.  Like last year was such an absolute horrible drought.  Didn't see it coming.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:03:23):**  With everything else going on in the world it was just an absolute crazy year so there  was COVID and then we had a grasshopper plague, we have a mouse plague, just all these things  going on and just wishing and hoping that there's going to be rain the next year is  
**[1:03:43-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:03:43):**  just not a safe bet to play.  We had culled our herd pretty hard a couple years ago so I thought these are all nice  young cows I really don't want to get rid of you know let's just see what happens and

**[1:04:11-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:04:11):**  maybe that's the failure being too proud of them not wanting to get rid of them but you've  got to manage your grass you've got to protect it so luckily I'm going to be able to leave  some ground and save my ass but had I not you know I'd probably be selling pears right  
**[1:04:25-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:04:25):**  now which might be fun.  Depends on the pears you're selling and you know I talked to a friend the other day that  he was making a pretty good trade from from black ones back to Herefords I mean I get  
**[1:04:39-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:04:39):**  that that might be a questionable decision for some people but he was swapping three  for five almost.  Oh wow.  
**[1:04:47-1:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:04:47):**  Yeah I mean I thought that was it I might make that trade it seems like a good trade.  To touch on that a little bit what what beef chain could end up doing for these guys who  are selling direct consumers is you don't have to sell a black-eyeded cow to get the  
**[1:05:04-1:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:05:04):**  most for it at a restaurant I mean if they don't care what color the hair was on it you  can raise whatever works best in your climate I mean if you're if you've got a mountain  lease and you've got Angus cattle because it makes you more money and you're dealing  
**[1:05:17-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:05:17):**  with water brisket all kinds of foot rot if you want to switch to a different breed you  sure can and still make the same money I mean dealing with short worn cattle now they come  in some wild colors and those cattle buyers don't always like those wild colors when it's  
**[1:05:33-1:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:05:33):**  just as good a calf as a black-eyed one so.  I've got plenty of I've got plenty of pretty ones too.  The thing too though is certified Angus beef they can have a certain percentage of white  
**[1:05:48-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:05:48):**  they can be Holstein and they'll still tag them as Angus they just have to meet some  pretty basic parameters if you ask me.  I have a friend whose name I won't mention that retained ownership of a pen of half Corriente  
**[1:06:06-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:06:06):**  half Charlet calves all the way to the box and they graded like 40 something percent  CAB like and it was right up there kind of pretty pretty close to industry average for  Choice Prime for anything else coming out of that feedlot but Corriente Charlet genetics  
**[1:06:27-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:06:27):**  half of it made CAB program what a drop of Angus in there.  Well that's also because consumers trust the CAB brand right and so we just need to like  kind of solve how Drew's doing it is like okay we don't need to trust the way the hive  
**[1:06:45-1:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:06:45):**  looks we need to trust the way the rancher is managing and we can solve that with this  QR code and then they can actually feel a personal experience attached to what they're  eating or they're supporting what their dollars do.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:06:58):**  I like it because go ahead touch on that a little bit you know sustainability is a big  thing.  It's all of a sudden become a buzzword with consumers and I think it's the global round  
**[1:07:10-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:07:10):**  table has this crazy definition of sustainability that they've come up with which is absolutely  insane I don't remember I read it a several years ago and it talked about how much water  it takes.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:07:22):**  But if you're going to a restaurant and you scan that QR code and this ranch has been  in the same family or business for a hundred years they're obviously using some sort of  sustainable practices you don't stay in business for that long by grubbing your pastures off  
**[1:07:37-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:07:37):**  every year and trying to get every little blade of grass into that cow for every pound  you're gonna last about five years doing that.  You know I really didn't think about that that's a good angle that's a good marketing  
**[1:07:52-1:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:07:52):**  angle.  And it kind of came to the end of my mind when I was hearing about the global round  table and their definition of sustainability and the fact that they're gonna tell a rancher  
**[1:08:04-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:08:04):**  whose ranch has been in his family for a hundred years this is what's sustainable when it should  be the opposite.  They should be asking the rancher how are you being sustainable this is how okay maybe  
**[1:08:14-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:08:14):**  we should look into that.  How can we help you be more sustainable?  Well exactly, exactly.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:08:21):**  I think it's changing too is the rangers are able to tell businesses how to be more sustainable  like I think we're changing the tables.  And what's sustainable in northeast Wyoming is not the same as what sustainable is.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:08:35):**  No, the context right?  There's definitely not a one size fits all for that.  So what would be the best advice that you could give somebody starting out or the best  
**[1:08:50-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:08:50):**  advice you wish you had gotten on your first day of ranching?  That's a pretty good question.  I guess if somebody was to come to me and say I want to start ranching I would say you  
**[1:09:08-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:09:08):**  know a high dollar bull going to these bull sales I have learned that you'll have a bull  you look at his EPDs and all his numbers and you'll go out in the pen and look at him looks  like a masculine nice bull.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:09:21):**  The bull that's on the page next to him that says all the same EPD numbers and looks exactly  the same.  People are willing to pay different monies for those bulls for some reason.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:09:31):**  You can get one bull for $2,500 and somebody else can spend $10,000 for that bull.  It's your breeding program is pretty important but don't think that high dollar bull means  anything a high dollar bull is not more valuable in your breeding program than a $2,500 bull.  
**[1:09:51-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:09:51):**  If they've got the same numbers are they going to make the same calf and you know the like  we talked about before big cows don't necessarily mean more money.  You can have a nice 1200 pound frame cow and learn how to manage your grass.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:10:06):**  You cannot go lease a section of land and you know your local farm board or whatever  says that that piece of land can manage 50 head of cattle.  You need to go out and look at it talk to the neighbors in the area people that know  
**[1:10:22-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:10:22):**  and learn a lot about soil and grass because that's really what we're selling.  We're selling grass that is being harvested by cattle so you got to know a lot about that.  That's one thing I wish I knew a lot more about was grass even more than I do doing  
**[1:10:37-1:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:10:37):**  this for a living.  That would be something super important.  Manage your property, manage your grass, what you got leased.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:10:45):**  I hate to quote Burke Teichert again but I'm gonna do it anyway.  He said he's in Wyoming too right so it was perfect.  Burke says at first when he got into the business he loved his cows and after he was in business  
**[1:10:58-1:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:10:58):**  for a while he learned a little more.  He learned to love his grass and then lately he's learned to love his soil and take care  of his soil and his soil takes care of his grass which raises good quality cattle.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:11:13):**  So by focusing more on the soil everything else follows.  It's a foundation right?  Yeah and this day and age there's some old ranchers that maybe will drive by a pasture  
**[1:11:28-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:11:28):**  that you had cows in and it's all the way grubbed down.  There's a counter every 10 feet every 6 feet and they maybe think you ruined that but if  you learn about soil you let that rest.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:11:40):**  You know what's going back into your soil from all them cowboys laying out there.  You know that in a year that's gonna be all nice bunch of grass you got there.  So it's learning about that kind of thing.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:11:55):**  Another advice I would be as far as falling in love with your cows is you've got to be  kind of ruthless and cutthroat when it comes to culling cattle.  If you've got this cow that's been around 10 years and she's been nice and gentle but  
**[1:12:07-1:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:07):**  she's got a slipper toe or a lump jaw on her or something and maybe isn't gonna raise the  best calf you can't afford to have her hanging out.  She got to go down the road.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:16):**  Or didn't show up with a calf.  Absolutely yep.  Oh but that's my favorite cow Drew I've had her for 15 years.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:25):**  I can't sell her.  You'll make her into a butcher and eat her yourself.  Don't sell her just put her in the freezer and enjoy her later.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:36):**  Yeah there you go nutrient cycling.  So right now what motivates you to get out of bed?  What do you jump out of bed?  
**[1:12:46-1:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:46):**  What are you excited for every day Drew?  Well when we first started this beef chain deal it was just an idea and it has grown  so big.  
**[1:12:55-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:12:55):**  I've done I never in my life thought I'd be doing podcasts and radio interviews and things  like that but it's the fact that someday we could be it could be back where if you want  to get into ranching you can go buy a ranch or finance a ranch and you can pay with it  
**[1:13:13-1:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:13:13):**  with cattle.  Your cows that you raise can pay for it.  It can put your kids through college.  
**[1:13:18-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:13:18):**  If your wife wants to or your significant other wants to they can stay at home help  raise your family because it's you know these ranchers are torturing themselves right now  barely breaking even because they love what they do.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:13:31):**  It's your own boss you're outside every day you know some of them complain about the weather  but a lot of them don't because it's better than sitting in an office somewhere.  So if the motivation for me is I want to get it to where ranchers are doing better than  
**[1:13:48-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:13:48):**  breaking even they're doing good.  It's a good industry to get into where in my area right here alone there's a 50-mile  strip of highway right here.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:13:59):**  There is maybe two other guys my age that are still in the ranching business and their  you know their parents or their grandparents are still having to ranch themselves because  they've got bills today.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:14:11):**  They can't retire you know they could maybe have their grandson or son be the higher than  them but that doesn't pay worth a damn either.  But if it could be someday where you can do this till you're tired of doing it and retired  
**[1:14:23-1:14:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:14:23):**  turn it over and your son children your daughter can still make good money and make a living  and raise a family also that's that's the end game that's what I'm excited about is  getting that goal accomplished.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:14:36):**  Kind of a common theme we we keep hearing repeated isn't it CK healthy land happy families  thriving communities something something school that shall not be named.  Teaching for profit commercial every time.  
**[1:14:50-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:14:50):**  I mean it's it's it's true like that is the core values that we all have.  My thing is is if you have a healthy ecosystem it's going to take care of you and your family.  And if agriculture schools were to fill it up because kids want to get their ag business  
**[1:15:08-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:15:08):**  degree because they wanted to get into this that'd be awesome because they could.  That's me that's what I did.  That's how that's how we're doing it.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:15:18):**  We're making changes.  So let's go way out on a limb Drew.  I'm going to put you in charge of whatever you want to be in charge of for a day.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:15:30):**  What are you going to change?  Charge of it as far as ranching wise or the sky's the limit.  You just rubbed a lamp magic genie popped out said Drew you get one wish to do whatever  
**[1:15:43-1:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:15:43):**  you want.  Well if if yes let's say if I was the president or if I had the ability to change some laws  you know the the country of origin labeling thing is is you know a whole different subject  
**[1:15:59-1:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:15:59):**  I would go I would lean more towards the what is called the prime act.  You know you have to be certified and that's basically saying if if the state uses or something  if a slaughter facility is state certified then beef that has been processed there can  
**[1:16:17-1:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:16:17):**  go to retail.  Yeah so then you're getting the USDA out of there because basically if if a if a slaughter  facility is good enough for me and I'm resident of Wyoming why is it good enough for my buddy  
**[1:16:29-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:16:29):**  down the road who's a resident of Wyoming.  If it's good enough for the people of Wyoming it's good enough for people of Wyoming.  If it's good enough for the people of Kansas it's good enough for them.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:16:38):**  Right.  So it's certified because the one of the problems that the USDA is having is they're not able  to man all these processing facilities.  
**[1:16:47-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:16:47):**  There's not enough people working there.  Well if they have the choice between sending a guy to Tyson so Tyson can run an extra shift  and process 6,000 head versus sending that extra guy down to Kyle a locker to my buddy  
**[1:17:03-1:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:17:03):**  Ricky so Ricky can kill 10 where do you think he's going to go.  Yeah he's going to go to Tyson and keep that big monster monster going because those 6,000  head are going to go who knows where all across the country.  
**[1:17:20-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:17:20):**  But yeah that is probably something that I change that I think would help because that  gives incentive for people to go build a custom slaughter facility.  If you're in an area that's agriculture all around and people are having to haul their

Speaking of that I have news.  
**[1:17:46-1:18:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:17:46):**  I know this won't come out for a month but just yesterday the city council of Medicine  Launch Kansas approved the permit for a micro processing plant in town.  I knew you wanted to do that.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:18:02):**  I'm not doing it I just know the guys that are but yeah we need it.  Within driving distance yeah.  Twenty miles.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:18:09):**  Yes.  A place to disassemble cattle in 20 miles.  That's I mean that's going to be a good thing for the community even though it's you know  
**[1:18:19-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:18:19):**  two to four jobs.  I mean that's huge for a small for a small community that's hurting.  And then yeah and then you know we're not sending money outside of our community to  
**[1:18:31-1:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:18:31):**  the packers and the packers aren't making that four hundred dollars a head and sending  us back crap that we didn't even raise here.  So that's yeah the the restaurant that I talked to they said they were amazed that they're  
**[1:18:45-1:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:18:45):**  surrounded by ranches and they cannot it's not possible for them to get the local ranches  deep in their store because all those ranches sell through sale barns and private contractors  but you get a slap of steak on your plate there and it might have been something that  
**[1:19:01-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:19:01):**  was raised in the dairy you might be a Holstein guy with no idea.  Which it's still good beef it can still be good beef I'm not I'm not like you know the  dairy people you can have good beef but yeah.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:19:14):**  There's all sorts of different beef and not saying that you know.  But it's consistency right it's good quality beef that you would you know you're gonna  get the same consistency if you eat at the same time because that producer does it the  
**[1:19:29-1:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:19:29):**  same way or knows what what the needs are.  And these these processors are definitely not worried about quality it's more on quantity  or a small thing like that definitely gonna be more worried about the quality of the beef  
**[1:19:44-1:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:19:44):**  that they're cutting out because it's coming from a ranch and it's trying to use that to  make put groceries on the table so they're raising the best they possibly can.  And not only that you know when we're starting to keep food much more local and traceable  
**[1:19:59-1:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:19:59):**  with with things like beef chain you know you know where that animal came from you know  how it was treated.  You know you can go you know I'm when I start participating you know of course like my QR  
**[1:20:14-1:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:20:14):**  code I'd want to link back to all my social media so people could go back and see all  that stuff or you know post that I have with that specific animal from two three years  ago when it was a calf maybe it links back to them if they want to know all that stuff  
**[1:20:27-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:20:27):**  it's connecting consumers with the story and the people that raise their food.  And, and using blockchain that can be a window the other way too, where if you're able to  track your calves because right now I sell my calves, they go to a feedlot in Nebraska  
**[1:20:44-1:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:20:44):**  and then I don't know where they go after that.  If they're all in and up at a fine dining restaurant in New York City or LA, I can use  that as marketing like this is where my stuff ending up if the system ever evolved far enough  
**[1:20:58-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:20:58):**  to do that, or if your stuff's ending up in Burger King and Perkins you know I probably  should probably change my breeding program up a little bit to get some more some better  bulls or something but that's another way to end up helping beef producers.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:21:12):**  And even if you are going to direct consumer and you're going to a local restaurant because  it's so local you're going to hear, hey that that beef that steak I had last night was  awesome or that steak was a little gristly you're gonna have to change something.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:21:27):**  That burger was a little bit chewy maybe.  I also like to add in, yeah I also like to add in consumers are going to actually get  a good view of what it actually takes to raise an animal.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:21:44):**  That it's not just flop them out and harvest them you know next next fall.  There's a process.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:52-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:21:52):**  They don't just grow on trees.  A big part of this is educating people.  I mean people who knows where they think their beef comes from.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:22:03):**  I saw a TikTok the other day where they think the government's providing it to them.  They're gonna quit sending food to supermarkets for some reason.  I think why cultured meat is, I don't want to say meat, but cultured meat right is people  
**[1:22:22-1:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:22:22):**  are buying into it because they don't know how their food is raised.  It sounds more humane or whatever but they don't.  If we can educate people that ranches are steward to the land, if you take all the cattle  
**[1:22:38-1:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:22:38):**  off this land, what's going to happen to it?  If the fires a couple years ago showed us anything it would be a thousand times worse.  Down there in your guys's area all that stuff burned up.  
**[1:22:53-1:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:22:53):**  If there weren't any cattle there grazing that for how many years?  I mean how bad would that have been?  Oh I don't want to think about it.  
**[1:23:02-1:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:02):**  It was bad enough to live through it.  I kind of almost have PTSD a little bit sometimes.  Can you imagine what the cedars would look like without any grazing?  
**[1:23:14-1:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:14):**  Yeah I've seen it.  I've seen it.  Imagine if there's no grazing though.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:17):**  It would just be all that.  Ready highly combustible forest.  And if we could educate people, because we're stewards of the land, we're taking care of  
**[1:23:30-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:30):**  wildlife.  A lot of these ranches in Wyoming have elk herds on them.  If you go wipe out your whole elk herd, you're not going to have any paying hunters the next  
**[1:23:40-1:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:40):**  year.  Deer populations, animal populations.  People need to realize how cattle aren't destroying sage grouse habitat they're actually helping.  
**[1:23:55-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:55):**  And that's what all this is part of.  We aren't the bad guys.  We're not poisoning you.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:23:59):**  We're trying to provide you with a good product.  I guess we don't need to really say who is poisoning everybody in the ecosystem.  Don't really want to make too many more enemies than we already have.  
**[1:24:11-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:24:11):**  So we are kind of closing up today.  Drew, have we left anything on the table?  Is there anything you'd like to ask me or CK?  
**[1:24:21-1:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:24:21):**  No I think that was pretty good.  That was probably one of the best interviews I got to do.  It's usually people who are more technical, more tech savvy computer people asking me  
**[1:24:30-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:24:30):**  those really hard questions that I don't know all the answers to.  But yeah, this has been a fun talk.  We're good ranchers in country folks and that's who we're trying to talk to.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:24:41):**  And you've got to bring it down to that level.  Not everybody speaks computer.  I don't and I'm in tech.  
**[1:24:51-1:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:24:51):**  I speak cow.  Well, if there's anything else?  But that's one of the fun things getting to talk to other people in agriculture.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:25:03):**  I mean we maybe raise cattle different, horses versus whatever.  But when you can get together and talk about cows and grass and stuff.  That's one of the main problems I'm seeing in the ag industry is these packers have huge  
**[1:25:17-1:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:25:17):**  lobbying groups and the ranchers can't even get together in one group to create a lobbying  group.  We can't agree on anything.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:25:24):**  Wasn't that what the checkoff was supposed to be for?  Yeah.  But there's people who, I mean I personally don't like the beef checkoff but I've got  
**[1:25:34-1:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:25:34):**  neighbors right down the road who think it's great.  So we can't agree on that but we can get together and talk about cows and grass.  Just like you said at the beginning of the interview, I think I even wrote it down, that  
**[1:25:49-1:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:25:49):**  JBS made $34 billion last year and they spent $7 million on lobbying that gave them a $900  million contract.  I've been kind of thinking about that.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:26:04):**  That's over a 100 to 1 return on their money.  There's nothing that any of the three of us can do to get that much return on our money  in one year.  
**[1:26:18-1:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:26:18):**  No.  That's good.  I don't want to start on a rant about government redistribution of wealth but it's kind of  
**[1:26:30-1:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:26:30):**  ridiculous that these three, four big protein companies have manipulated lawmakers and manipulated  the rules to benefit them and lock out smaller producers and smaller plants from coming into  the market.  
**[1:26:47-1:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:26:47):**  It's scary.  It's shameful that it's gotten this far.  I hate to end there.  
**[1:26:57-1:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:26:57):**  There is light.  I think there's a lot of new plants opening up.  I heard last week that there were over 30 plants, like 38 plants that were permitted  
**[1:27:07-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:07):**  in the state of Texas to begin construction this year.  There's one here in my community.  I think there's at least two more here in Kansas that they're working on.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:20):**  I think we just have to be patient and give it time and build in that extra capacity where  we're not reliant on these big packers and their mega plants.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:27:31-1:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:31):**  It's got to be producer-led.  We can't sit on our hands and wait for the government to fix the problem because they're  just not going to do it.  
**[1:27:42-1:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:42):**  You kind of made a point.  It's difficult for ranchers to have a union or get together as a lobbying group.  It really is.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:50):**  Part of the problem is we're so spread out.  There's so few of us.  The things that make sense for my friends in California don't necessarily make sense  
**[1:27:59-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:27:59):**  for you in Wyoming, don't necessarily make sense for my friends in Florida.  We can all agree that the cows probably aren't right and we need to change how we're doing  business and we need more packing plants.  
**[1:28:12-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:28:12):**  That's been the common theme for quite a while and I think we can all get to that place.  Absolutely.  So, guys, I think on that note, I'm going to go ahead and do some music and we'll go  
**[1:28:25-1:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/15-Drew-Perrson-Beefchain--crypto-and-block-chained-explained-by-a-cattleman-e11qtak#t=1:28:25):**  ahead and get out of here for the day.  Awesome.  Well, gang, it's Red Hills Rancher wrapping up another episode of Reboot with my fantastic

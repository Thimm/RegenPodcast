**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:00:31):**  Hi all, this is Ranch's reboot with Red Hills Rancher and CK.  Today we have Michael Kinsey of Reverend Wild Ranch calling out from Georgia.  What part of Georgia are you in Michael?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:00:42):**  Chickamauga, Georgia.  That's upper northwest Georgia.  Perfect.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:00:46):**  Alright, I'm going to give it to you Brian.  Alright, thanks CK.  Mike, it's great to have you here.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:00:55):**  So tell us a little bit about yourself.  Tell us your history and your education.  What's the story of Michael?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:01:01):**  Here we go.  Let's launch off into the deep.  I did not go to school for this to be a rancher.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:01:08):**  I was not brought up in a family of ranchers.  I'm first generation.  So I guess I'll start just with kind of what set me on this path.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:01:20):**  I kind of owe a debt of gratitude to one of my best friend's grandparents who are retired  dairy farmers in South Carolina.  I grew up going to their farm multiple times a year and would help them.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:01:35):**  And that's kind of, I guess, where the first spark of passion for this profession came  from.  And then as I got older, I was in FFA in high school and that's about as close to, I guess,  
**[0:01:51-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:01:51):**  any applicable agricultural education I ever got.  I had a fabulous, fabulous agriculture teacher who also I owe a debt of gratitude to as far  as just furthering that passion, if you will.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:02:09):**  But then I ended up after high school, I went to a small Christian liberal arts college  in Cleveland, Tennessee, Lee University.  And I met my wife there.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:02:20):**  And after that, I mean, when I graduated, I got a marketing degree, left there, moved  to Metro Atlanta, worked in a couple of different fields, but most for the majority of that  time for about five years, I worked in the commercial construction industry.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:02:39):**  And kind of just that whole time from the time I was in high school all the way through  college, through that my early career, I guess you would say, I never, I always had that  passion in me.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:02:53):**  I was always reading, you know, Joel Salatin books or any kind of book that was kind of  geared more towards the regenerative ag side of things.  I was in my spare time, that's what I was doing or listening to podcasts or watching  
**[0:03:10-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:03:10):**  videos talks given by Gage Brown or, you know, just all kinds of stuff.  So that's kind of the quick and dirty of it.  And finally, I kind of just hit a breaking point with where I was.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:03:24):**  It just wasn't, I was tired of dealing with, first of all, Metro Atlanta has a lot of people,  there's a lot of people there.  That's not exactly where I grew up.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:03:36):**  I grew up in a pretty rural area and so I wasn't happy there.  And it was time for a change and me and my wife kind of just decided, you know what,  if we're going to try this, now's the time.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:03:52):**  And I think the straw that broke the Campbell's back, my wife was diagnosed with some pretty  severe thyroid condition and was told that she'd be on medication the rest of her life.  And her condition kind of continually kept devolving.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:04:13):**  And so finally I kind of felt a little helpless as a husband to be able to do anything to  help her.  And finally she sought the help of a more holistic based doctor who told her to go strictly  
**[0:04:27-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:04:27):**  organic, took her off her medication, put her on a bunch of natural herbal based supplements,  and she saw significant improvement.  And I know that may not be the story or work for everybody, but it worked for her.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:04:42):**  And I kind of basically said, you know what, if there's one thing I think I can do, it's  I can help be a part of growing healthy food for people.  That was kind of the thing that launched us towards, okay, let's actually try this because  
**[0:04:58-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:04:58):**  she's not the only person we know who's dealing with those kinds of things.  So anyway, that's kind of the quick and dirty, if you will, kind of point A to point B that  what got us here.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:13):**  That was great.  That was perfect.  I was, you know, my follow up question to that is, you know, what got you interested  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:19):**  in reaging?  But yeah, no, that's perfect.  Yes.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah.  I love too that you said, even though this works for her, it may not work for everyone,  like, but this is why we're doing it because we know that it works for her.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:32):**  So it's got to work for other people too.  And I think that's the same thing with regenerative ranching versus conventional.  It's like, we know not everyone needs it, but or can do it, but it's working for us.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:44):**  And we see, we see a mission to do this.  So we're going to do it.  Definitely.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:49):**  Yeah, definitely.  And I've kind of been on that.  Do what?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:05:54):**  My friend, Ellen Moller, last year at Soil Health U, she had a really great quote that  I like to share.  Yeah, health is a journey.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:03):**  You start where you are.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  So the title is ranching reboot.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:10):**  And for this first series of episodes, we really want to focus on new guys like you  that don't necessarily come from a traditional ranching background.  And you know, we want to talk about some of the new and innovative things that are going  
**[0:06:24-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:24):**  on in ranching.  Especially how to get started, how to go find contacts and livestock and acquire resources  and where you acquire knowledge.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:34):**  So where did you acquire your startup land base?  Well, I'll start with you.  I don't know if you've seen Brian or not, but this small series I did.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:46):**  So you want to be a rancher on TikTok?  I think I saw a few.  I don't know if I had time to catch all of them.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:53):**  Yeah, I love your content, Mike.  It's a big world.  Yeah, oh, dude, I understand completely.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:06:59):**  It's really I tried to cover some of those things for some people as far as one of my  biggest things for folks that want to get into this is a mantra is you need to get knowledge  and experience before because there's so many people that just think, well, oh, if I just  
**[0:07:17-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:07:17):**  have land, I could do it.  And that was kind of where I was.  I mean, I spent almost a decade of research on the ground trying to get my mind wrapped  
**[0:07:31-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:07:31):**  around all the nuances of this.  And then the moment your boots hit the ground and it's like, OK, I just bought my cows,  I leased this property.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:07:42):**  You realize how little you actually know, no matter how much you've done.  Scary, yeah.  Definitely.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:07:48):**  I mean, the effect maybe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, that's why I say you have to have knowledge and experience, because I was very  
**[0:07:56-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:07:56):**  knowledge rich, but I was experienced for.  And so those that's why I preach that as a mantra to folks that want to get into this  because I try to help people avoid making the same mistakes I had to make or learn in  
**[0:08:11-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:08:11):**  the hard way.  So that's one thing.  Secondly, Brian, you asked how I got my land base is why I ended up through a series of  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:08:21):**  different contacts.  We looked for farms for a long time.  We had it in our head like, OK, we're going to buy a farm because it just seemed like  
**[0:08:29-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:08:29):**  leasing was like this daunting task.  Couldn't find my lease.  And honestly, it was one of those things that I can only say was a God ordained thing because  
**[0:08:39-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:08:39):**  it just all the pieces fell into place.  One of my wife's relatives ended up saying, hey, like, I've got this place, like, why  don't you lease it?  
**[0:08:49-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:08:49):**  Just bizarre, like one of those things.  So it was always something that was like, I never even knew this was an existing possibility.  So that was my situation was kind of a fluke.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:00):**  But as far as generally speaking, you've been talking about it for a while.  You've been thinking about it.  You've been planning.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:08):**  You've been looking at things.  And, you know, I'm sure your family had heard these things.  You'd point at the idea that, you know, definitely looking for something.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:15):**  And when they hear of an opportunity, they remember to tell you so.  It kind of goes back with what Hobbs was saying on our last episode about, you know, you have  to build contacts and about, you know, working, you know, putting conscious effort every day  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:29):**  towards your dream.  Absolutely.  And me and Hobbs are of one mind when it comes to that.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:35):**  I was very big into, you know, if you're passionate about something and you want to pursue it,  you've got to kind of put that out there into the universe and pursue it and sometimes pursue  it.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:46):**  And the pursuit of that dream doesn't look like, you know, necessarily moving cows or  working for someone who's a rancher.  It may just be simply not giving up on it.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:09:58):**  Because I just know so many people that I worked with who when I turned my notice in  at the job I was at was I had a great job like and they were just like when I told them  what I was going to do, they're like, Oh, my gosh, that's awesome.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:10:13):**  I wish I had done that.  I was, you know, and so you see all these guys that were much my senior who were very  supportive of that.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:10:21):**  And it's just like, well, not to say that, you know, anybody and everybody's made to  do this because most people are and most people definitely look at it through rose colored  glasses.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:10:32):**  But there's a lot of people that give up on their agricultural dreams and stick with a  cubicle.  So to those people that those are the people I would definitely say just don't give up  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:10:44):**  on it.  Keep putting it out there into the union universe because I never thought I would be able to  do this until I was probably retired.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:10:52):**  Like I was just thought like this is something I'll just keep in the back of my head and  I'll research it and stuff and by the time I'm ready to do it, you know, I'll just know  everything.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:00):**  It's dead.  That was not the plan.  I think that was part of a trap of of a previous generation or two is, oh, yeah, get a town  
**[0:11:13-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:13):**  job and work and then we'll retire.  Maybe we can retire to come back from the farm.  And that model has never really worked.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:22):**  I mean, average age in agriculture.  See, I've been doing this now.  The this is my 15th year for they all should be retiring.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah, yeah.  Average age should eventually come down.  But it keeps going up.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:36):**  And that's a crazy thing.  Yeah, because well, and for a lot of people, and I know for myself included, like I've  had to have conscious talks with my wife where I say like, because we have a little boy and  
**[0:11:48-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:11:48):**  who is almost two years old.  And I'm at the point where I'm already thinking trying to think that far in advance is, okay,  what's going to happen one day when I'm retirement age, if he wants to take over the farm, you  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:06):**  know, because I feel like there's so many people out there who either have convinced  their children that the farm is not for them.  You know, that you can't make.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:14):**  Yeah.  Or that do not want to turn over the reins.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:19):**  control thing.  And also, I won't deny that there's probably a lot of people that are in similar boats  for me this, this is just this is what they enjoy.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:27):**  They just like Yeah.  And so even though it's hard, they like doing it, and they never known anything else.  So the thought of just handing that to someone else is like, well, why I'm enjoying what  
**[0:12:37-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:37):**  I'm doing.  I'm gonna retire.  But you know, that gets into all kinds of other issues, you know, socio political issues  
**[0:12:46-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:46):**  and economic issues.  Generation succession.  And yeah, that's, those are probably future podcast episodes.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:12:55):**  Definitely.  So I think I've been curious about for a while, and your brand is terrific.  And I haven't actually published my brand design for Red Hills rancher, but it's kind  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:07):**  of basically going to be very, very similar to yours.  But you know,  it's gonna be the R backwards are with an eight shoved in between it.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:14):**  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean,  yeah.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah.  So how did you come up with river wild ranch?  Let's, let's go ahead.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:24):**  Okay.  Because I know you have a good story.  So names, like if you knew me, like really personally, you'd know, like mine.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:33):**  I'm very particular about names and names like carry a lot of weight for me.  And I don't know if that's a marketing degree.  So things like that are important.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:42):**  Yeah, it's important.  But I mean, just beyond that, I think it probably, you know, subconsciously has to do with the  fact that I'm named after my father.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:13:51):**  And I always like carried that weight of like, what my name meant, you know, it was like,  it wasn't just a label for me.  It was like carrying a banner, if you will.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:14:02):**  So I kind of carried that or projected that into what the name of the ranch should be.  So I toiled over it for a long time.  Like there was a quite a good while we were here in operation with no name, just because  
**[0:14:19-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:14:19):**  I had not settled on anything.  And finally, I just made a list.  My wife told me she was like, just make a list of all the words you're thinking about  
**[0:14:29-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:14:29):**  that you're kicking around the names you're thinking of.  And so I just made a list of words that all had some significant meaning to me.  And she and then I handed her that list.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:14:40):**  And she actually like, just looked at it and said, Well, what about she's like, I like  reverent.  What about reverent and wild?  
**[0:14:50-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:14:50):**  Because what about reverent wild farms?  And I said, Well, I was like, and that was when my marketing degree kicked in.  Because I said, No, no, no, no, reverent wild ranch.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:00):**  That sounds good.  Yeah.  I was like, it's us.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:04):**  So that was that was it.  I mean, from that point forward, there was no, you just had that aha moment.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:10):**  We'll work with that.  So and then I sent out to Okay, now I've got to design the brain.  And yeah, that was another long process for me.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:20):**  Like, in fact, I'm sitting here at my desk.  Let me see if I can pull out.  I know it's buried in here somewhere.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:26):**  I've got like little sketch pads with all kinds of previous designs on them.  I won't sit here and search forever.  But if I can find it, I'll pull it up and show it to you.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:36):**  Right.  But I know exactly what you're talking about, though.  My husband and I are thinking of doing a business that business or like, what do we call it?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:44):**  Like even though we're a year away, we're like, have no idea.  Well, I think you should know.  You should definitely start thinking about it now.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:15:51):**  But I'm saying our sketchpad, we're writing names down making lists.  What do you think of this thing?  We should be able to afford the local forage in the area.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:00):**  You know, like Bluestem vet here in Kansas for friends with or like Fred Hills rancher  like that to me, I love it.  So  
**[0:16:07-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:07):**  to me from from a marketing perspective, I mean, this is where the one the one thing  that my my degree has actually helped me in is it's just in this app.  Yeah, that's awesome.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:21):**  Is just being able to say like, okay, like, well, that flows good and be able to look  at like other major brands and like, okay, well, what's good about that brand that it's  yeah.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:33):**  And so anyway, that I spent a while designing my brand.  And I had a probably 4050 one offs of just crumple up the paper and throw it away.  And I finally did the same thing.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:45):**  I narrowed it down to like, three or four that I was like, okay, I could go with either  one of these but for various reasons.  And then finally, my wife was I let her make the decision because you know, it's easier  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:16:58):**  to give it to somebody else.  I'm like, okay, which out of these three, which one do you like the best?  She's like, that one.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:17:02):**  I was like, Cool, we'll do that.  Awesome.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:17:06):**  And, you know, I just want to say for the people that are listening that aren't necessarily  involved in a I've never been around cattle.  You know, the brand is the brand you put on your cattle and that's your mark of ownership.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:17:18):**  Yes, and it's, it can't be colored, it has to be very simple lines.  And it also kind of has to be representative of your outfit or translate, translate to  something, you know, some symbol.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:17:36):**  I saw one today one this morning on tik tok that somebody said that was a shit house brand  and I thought that was kind of funny.  So like your brand is, I mean, it's terrific, represents you.  
**[0:17:51-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:17:51):**  And I think that's kind of the important point to get across, especially to somebody that's  starting out is that there is a lot of significance in a name, because that name and that brand  is going to represent you, your ranch, and your cattle for ever, ever.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:10):**  And that's the next legacy.  Yeah.  And that's the gravity that I had like resting on my shoulders and I know anybody else who's  
**[0:18:18-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:18):**  ever like, you know, sat down and then like, okay, I've got this cattle ranch, I need to  come up with a brand.  Because I had to think about it too, from a perspective of what would I like to see,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:28):**  you know, branded on the run for my cows one day, because this is something you may you  may understand, Brian, I don't know, in Kansas, do you legally have to brand?  Are you still an ear tag only state?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:40):**  Well, we're optional.  We do have registered brands.  So and that's a legal mark of ownership here in Kansas.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:48):**  But yeah, there's nothing like a brand committee or brand inspections like there are in some  other states.  Okay, well, like I know in some states, like legal ownership is by brand.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:18:59):**  And in Georgia, it's not that way.  But I, I've had a lot of people ask me in on TikTok and whatnot, what, you know, will  I ever brand my cattle?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:10):**  And I like I always say like, yeah, I'll probably end up doing cold branding.  Just I personally just really like the way a cold brand looks on a red hided animal.  The white hair.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah, yeah.  And so that that's kind of probably the direction I'll go.  But I'm also like super particular because I refuse to I have some really nice cattle  
**[0:19:31-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:31):**  already, but I refuse to brand anything that I didn't breed and raise.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:40):**  That makes a lot of 100%.  Yeah, I'm like, I'm not going to take somebody else's genetics, there was under management  and put my brand on it and try to just like say, Hey, look what look what we've got.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:52):**  And because I know that happens.  And I just refuse to me, that's just like an integrity thing.  I guess I just won't do it.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:19:58):**  Exactly.  I think that's something that that we need to bring to the industry is a lot of transparency  and accountability to our customers.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:20:11):**  So let's talk about your customers and your marketing.  So how are you marketing and who are you marketing to?  So this is funny, because I really do you want to talk about where I'm at now?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:20:24):**  Or do you want to talk about the like, the start of the business, like when I when I  set out to do because because of COVID I've had to pivot and  hear the whole story.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:20:37):**  I want to hear the whole story because yeah, you know, we've all lived through it.  Yeah, definitely.  So um, so I started out with the intention of being organic, grass fed, you know, getting  
**[0:20:49-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:20:49):**  grass genetics, cattle, and I was going to go from I was going to be conception to consumption.  So that was the goal for me.  And so I set out and I've since talked to many people who are aspiring ranchers and  
**[0:21:05-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:05):**  told them this is absolutely not what they should do.  The first thing I did is I bought the cows that were on the property that we leased because  the person that was currently leasing it was looking to get out of it.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:19):**  We're all wanting to sell.  So I was like, well, it's an opportunity.  Pretty good black Angus cows.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:25):**  Like it's not really what I want, but it's a good foundation.  Good starting point.  And so I did that.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:33):**  Well, if anybody who's in this industry knows that a cow calf industry, if you're not going  to sell the calves, if you're trying to get to the end consumer, this is the longest possible  path for that you can take.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah, you're looking at a timeframe.  And so I made that mistake.  That's what I did first, first mistake.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:21:57):**  But I saw that through.  I ended up buying in some steers, some South Pole steers from another guy who wasn't too  far away and selling some of that beef marketing, my beef, mainly, I didn't really market my  
**[0:22:12-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:22:12):**  beef that much more than outside the circle of people I knew.  So it was mostly just friends, family, friends, family, word of mouth marketing.  I wasn't like posting Facebook ads or any of that kind of jazz.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:22:27):**  So like in that aspect, the marketing degree did me no good because I basically was just  like, you know, because I have it in my mind is just growing slow is sustainable, but it's  crazy as this will sound.  
**[0:22:46-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:22:46):**  And I guess TikTok is a justification of this is I know when I like put my mind, my creative  juices towards like, okay, this, I need to sell this or I need to do this.  It can get out of hand quick.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:23:03):**  So that is kind of like I was always reserved to market myself because I know I have the  ability to overmarket myself, if that makes sense, to not be able to keep up with the  demand I can generate.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:23:17):**  And so that in that respect, that's just playing to my strengths is I know I can market it,  but I might not be able to get the product to the consumer, which makes a mad consumer.  So basically, like I got to a point where right before COVID, I like I was really the  
**[0:23:37-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:23:37):**  engine had started really starting to turn over.  I was shipped.  And this was kind of all coincided at one time, it's like, at that point, I think my  
**[0:23:46-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:23:46):**  TikTok account was like it 10,000 people and I thought like, Oh, my God, like I have just,  you know, I have more people than I could ever imagine to market to.  And I had people wanting me to ship them beef in Miami in New York.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:03):**  And like I was shipping, I wasn't shipping beef like that far, I can sell to kind of  a more regional scale.  But I was shipping beef like in the southeast.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:15):**  And I was like, Oh, man, this is this is going to be the year like this is 2020 is going  to be it.  And then like the basically the moment COVID started to run, and they shut down the major  
**[0:24:30-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:30):**  packing plants, just the train wreck happened.  And so currently, I still don't have any processing dates for this year.  No.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:41):**  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the processor I have that I was working with it was fabulous.  I mean, I know people that have been using him, like, for the remainder of 2021.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:53):**  No processing day.  Correct.  And so I know people that have been working with my processor for 15 years.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:24:59):**  They don't have processing dates.  What's going on?  Who's who bought all the dates?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:25:07):**  Well, here's the thing too, is with that model.  There's no recourse.  If I go in and I book up, I want five cows a week.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:25:20):**  I can book them solid five cows a week.  And if I cancel, I got no skin in the game.  There's no deposit.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:25:28):**  There's no nothing.  So a lot of people did that and then found out that, oh my God, there's all this demand  for beef.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:25:36):**  And then they go to the sale barn and just get cold cows, haul them up there and they  were selling ground beef out of a cold cow for $10 a pound in the midst of the COVID  crisis.  
**[0:25:48-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:25:48):**  But the ripple effects from that shutdown, we're still seeing that.  And that's regional for us.  I mean, any processor anywhere close to us has that same backup.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:00):**  Like you are not getting in this year.  It's the same story here.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:05):**  And I haven't heard any different from anyone, any part of the country.  That's part of what led me down the path to like, okay, might want to start my own processing  facility, but we'll get into that in a minute.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:20):**  But I have since pivoted because I know like with the window of, okay, this year I'm out.  There's no processing.  So I'm not selling any organic grass fed beef.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:33):**  I've got my freezer here.  Like I'm good.  You know, I've got enough beef for me and my family, but that's not going to be my revenue  
**[0:26:42-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:42):**  stream.  And since I have 200 mama cows, that's including my heifers.  I was like, well, time to go back to, okay, we can still play in the cow calf market.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:26:56):**  And so that's why this year I sold my South Pole.  I brought in some fleck fee, cementals because I need bulls that can have calving ease, but  can produce a nice, healthy calf crop that I can sell to make money.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:27:16):**  So that's where we're at currently.  But I also wanted to, I didn't want to go so far as to say like, okay, I'm going to  go get some, I don't know if you pick any breed you want to.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:27:28):**  I wanted to still stay kind of in the lane of like, okay, I can go to a continental breed,  but I still want something that can be forage efficient.  Long-term if I say retain some heifers could affect my genetics positively.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:27:46):**  We can add some ribeye area, maybe get some of the positive attributes of that without  completely going to left field to some crazy feedlot genetic animal.  So right.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:27:57):**  Okay.  I've rambled a while.  So that was good.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:00):**  Oh, that was great.  And you know, I do kind of want to ask you about your cows and your genetics and your  thought process behind that.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:12):**  Okay.  I have found that Brian, to be kind of one of my downfalls is I can get really down that  rabbit hole of the genetics.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:22):**  Like, I mean, honestly, last night I was looking at a boron bull out of South Africa that I'm  like, I could import some semen on that bull.  Like that, that's just like, I have no reason to do that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:36):**  Like that's, I've got, so I've got enough diversity in my genetics as it is.  I'm raising three Michonne bulls right now.  I intend to use them probably on my spring cows.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:50):**  And that's all I'll bring them in the summer.  They should be ready by then.  I'm kind of like, you know, you're going to have to save me one of those bull calves out  
**[0:28:58-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:28:58):**  of that Michonne.  Let me tell you something about the Michonas now.  Like they have, I have one, one of the cows, I bought five.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:29:09):**  One of them is a downright beautiful example of efficiency.  She stays, she's like a tank and she stays thick all year round.  And her calf, that was out of my South Pole bulls is stunning.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:29:26):**  Like she is gorgeous.  And so I've really realized that there's a lot to be had in the hybrid vigor using the  Michonne genetics, but you're not going to get it in straight line Michonne.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:29:38):**  Like if you, all you want is an efficient, it's kind of like you running your Korean  and he's like, if you want to get forage efficient animal, that's going to just perform and put  you a decent cap on the ground.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:29:49):**  That's the way you can stay in that lane.  But if you're trying to be more broad like me and go to end consumer, like the carcass  isn't really going to work out.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:29:58):**  You're not going to have much of a carcass to sell.  So that's kind of like something I'm playing with.  You know me, like I love South Poles.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:30:07):**  They're probably, in my opinion, this is just me babbling and looking forward.  I would say like in my mind, the South Pole will always be about 50% of my genetic profile  is kind of what I'm looking for.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:30:22):**  Because I've found them to be a very strong, maternal efficient cow.  They have their weaknesses though.  They get marketed in a way that is like, this cow is the answer to all your problems.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:30:40):**  Whether you're a commercial cow, cow-calf producer, or whether you're growing grass  fed beef, this is the only animal you'll ever need.  And in all reality-  
**[0:30:49-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:30:49):**  Well, that's the marketing pitch of every bull breeder, isn't it?  And every breed association.  But I have found that there's a lot of truth to that with South Pole and there's just a  
**[0:30:58-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:30:58):**  lot of, and it's kind of the same in like the Angus world, it's obviously exacerbated  in the Angus world.  But you found a lot of mom and pop breeders that they just had a bull and they decided,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:31:13):**  well, we'll raise that bull calf and we can sell it for $2,000 or whatever because the  market's so hot with South Poles right now.  But I find that there's some areas in which the breed, I wouldn't say needs improvement.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:31:28):**  The breed does what it's advertised to do.  But as far as what I need and my consumers desire, there are some ways I think we could  improve upon that.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:31:40):**  And also just on the efficiency side, one of the things that I found that I learned  the hard way is being organic is not easy.  And you have to have some cows that are very tough to get through that.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:31:59):**  Especially when you're like me and you're young and you look at the whole world as like,  oh, I've read these Joel Salatin books.  And if I just graze these cows the right way, it'll all just fall into place.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:32:11):**  And the ecosystem is bursting forth.  That is not the case in reality, that takes time.  And so that is one place where I can say far more than any other breed, the unimproved  
**[0:32:31-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:32:31):**  genetics of a African or in my case of a Michonne cow, those cows thrive if you're going to  just pull the rug out from under your cows, because that is what I did.  I bought my cows and I said, they're organic now.  
**[0:32:49-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:32:49):**  No fly control, no warmer, no nothing.  And 30% of the dry matter from the pasture, right?  And so I can imagine that being tough.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:33:02):**  It was a hard steep learning curve for me and harder for them.  So that definitely is difficult and that is one area where I've realized that the South  Pole will exceed over your traditional Angus, Simmental, what her for whatever they will  
**[0:33:22-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:33:22):**  exceed better and thrive in that environment more so than those other breeds, your traditional  commercial breeds.  However, they still pale in comparison to the African breeds.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:33:36):**  I mean, seriously, as soon as I bought those cows and put them through a summer, a fly  season and just like, you have to work hard to make a Michonne get pink eye and you have  to really, I mean, I don't think you can heat stress them.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:33:59):**  And when the South Pole's head to the shade after everybody else is already there, the  Michonne is still out grazing.  So as far as an ecosystem improving tool, I found them to be very strong.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:34:13):**  They're very good candidate, but they still lack in other areas.  So I'm kind of trying to create long-term, I want to kind of create my own composite,  but like, I'm not trying to market that.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:34:29):**  I'm not trying to create my own breed.  I just want to-  You're just matching to your environment.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:34:34):**  Correct.  I'm just going to use a mishmash of different genetics.  I mean, I might play with beef master later on.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:34:42):**  I might play with some boron later on through AI or something.  But for the most part, my goal is to get a really forage efficient animal that is a moderate  size.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:34:54):**  I feel like I'm probably sound like I'm picking on the South Pole breed a little bit, and  I guess I kind of am, but I just feel like there's-  Oh, go ahead.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:35:03):**  There's plenty of South Pole fanboys in the world.  Oh, there are.  And I feel like there's so much fluff out there about it that somebody has to kind of  
**[0:35:11-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:35:11):**  speak some truth into the reality of the situation.  They're phenomenal animals.  It's just not- Let's see here.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:35:25):**  How do I say this without being too politically incorrect?  They definitely have their weak points, and I would say going back to there being a lot  of backyard breeders in that realm, if you bought your seed stock from even some of the  
**[0:35:46-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:35:46):**  people that are really well known in that world, there's a lot of people that will tell  you they need to be 900 pounds full grown.  And I'm like, I'm sorry.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:35:57):**  I'm not telling you that's wrong.  If your blinders are on and all you're looking at is environmental-  The end wave.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:36:04):**  Yeah.  Sure.  That's fine.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:36:07):**  But some of us out here have to make a living with these cows.  Big animals make the packers more money.  Small animals make the rancher more money.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:36:19):**  Yes.  And that is true until you get into grass finished beef and you hand a customer a steak  that's this ribeye that's this big.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:36:33):**  And they say, why did I- Wait, wait, how much a pound did I pay for this?  Because I can go to Costco and get a prime steak.  And I've had that happen to me.  
**[0:36:44-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:36:44):**  Now, normally I would say, I tell people, well, I'm sorry, you're just not my customer.  Because if you don't see the other benefits to buying beef from me, then if you're comparing  me to Costco, you're not my customer.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:01):**  And that's okay.  But at the same time- I guess that's a great way to look at it  too, Michael.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:07):**  Yeah.  I mean, absolutely.  And you have to be able to say no to a lot of people because you know this, in just life,  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:15):**  you're never going to make everybody happy.  No.  There's not.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:19):**  And I've missed a lot of people off, even people that were family friends of mine, just  being like, listen, if you're unhappy with what you bought from me, you didn't enter  into this exchange unknowing of what I was giving you.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:35):**  Like you chose to buy this from me.  And if you're unhappy with it, I was like, does the product taste bad?  Is there anything like, no.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:44):**  Just like steaks are just a little small.  And I thought I was going to get more steaks.  And I'm like, well, you bought and see how I was packaging my products is I was doing  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:37:53):**  like box orders that were came out.  So it was like based on box quarters.  I was even going.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:38:01):**  I was going.  So I had like 25 pound boxes that were like, I don't know what fraction it was, but it  was like, you know, whatever just took the ratio of the cuts that came off the animal  
**[0:38:13-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:38:13):**  and just keep narrowing it down until you get that.  And so, you know, and I sold some of those to some people that were like, I just thought  I'd get more steaks.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:38:23):**  And it's like, well, by ratio, you got about 17% steaks that come off the animal and that's  what you get in the box.  So if you buy 25 pounds of beef and you get two rib eyes, that's the ratio.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:38:37):**  Like, I'm sorry, I can't magically snap my fingers and make a cow that produces 50% steaks.  It just doesn't exist.  So that was one thing I had to kind of learn and shift through, but I'm kind of pivoting  
**[0:38:54-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:38:54):**  back to what I was originally going to say is just, you know, you have to focus on a  moderate animal.  And I think that's the key is we got, and you can find that in almost any breed.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:39:07):**  There is not one specific breed that just has like the stranglehold on this is the,  you know, the most moderate breed, I would say the like original Angus genetics.  That's why they became popular in the first group.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:39:22):**  Right.  Right.  Because they were good.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:39:25):**  They were good at the time.  And, you know, I don't want to upset any Angus people.  But there's a lot of other great genetics there.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:39:35):**  And there's a lot to be said about heterosis, and hybrid vigor, and breeding an animal that  is appropriate for your environment.  Because let's face it, you know, where our last guest was Hobbs Magaray, almost butchered  
**[0:39:51-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:39:51):**  his name.  And he's out in Oregon, and you're there in Georgia.  And you know, I'm kind of in the middle, we're all three of us were vastly different, contextual  
**[0:40:02-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:40:02):**  environments, and the same breed of cows, or the same breeding strategy that works for  me will work for you.  And we'll end up with the same kind of cow for our environment.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:40:15):**  But that doesn't mean that we can trade cows and I can send my cows to Georgia and they'll  do great.  Right you I could probably send my cows to you.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:40:23):**  And they would go from looking like, oh, those are good cows to like, oh, my God, those are  nice cows.  Because anytime you take an animal from east to west, the improvement in every bite they  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:40:38):**  take from a nutritional standpoint.  Yeah, goes up astronomically, whereas my forage compared to yours is water.  So yeah, right.  
**[0:40:47-0:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:40:47):**  It's like your cows, if you brought them here, now your Corianis could probably handle it.  But if you take an Angus based genetic cow that's grass only, and move them from Kansas  to here, you're gonna have a cow that it goes from looking like a stud, especially in bulls,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:41:05):**  you see this a lot.  It'll look like a stud there, and you move on here.  And as soon as summer hits, man, that's just like, why can't I see that bulls like, I can  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:41:13):**  see his whole rib cage.  They'll just wither, it just happens.  But that's, that's just adaptation.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:41:20):**  And so I just think there's a balance to be struck if you really are trying to look at  the whole of the market, which is kind of the blessing and the curse of where I'm at  in my business strategy is trying to go from conception to consumption, is you're forced  
**[0:41:37-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:41:37):**  to look at the entirety of the market.  Whereas somebody that is say, strictly a cow calf operation, that's regenerative, organic,  focusing on improving the environment.  
**[0:41:49-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:41:49):**  And they can do those things, and they can have an 800 pound full grown cow, and it's  cool.  They can run more of them per acre.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:42:02):**  And that helps their cash, overall, the amount of cash they can make.  But at the end of the day, somebody like myself, who wants to carry it all the way through  to the consumer, you have to have a vastly different marketing strategy to market that  
**[0:42:17-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:42:17):**  animal's beef than you would say if I was just raising a modest, not anything huge,  but if I saved my momma cows for 1200 pounds, full grown, full term pregnancy.  So let's say just on the hoof, not in full term, they're 1000 pounds, 1100 pounds.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:42:41):**  That's a modest animal.  By the industry standard, that's still a fairly small animal.  And with that kind of animal though, you can get a carcass that makes more pleasing cuts  
**[0:42:53-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:42:53):**  to the end consumer.  And so I'm kind of trying to look at all of that and kind of just wade through the misinformation.  Because there's a lot of it out there, honestly, on both sides.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:43:05):**  I've seen it.  And that's kind of where I'm at now.  I actually wanted to talk to you about this, Brian, because I've kind of become a little  
**[0:43:15-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:43:15):**  jaded towards the whole regenerative ag movement in some ways.  And I'm still totally on board with the practice.  It's just, I guess you would say I'm just kind of weighed down by all the BS that's  
**[0:43:32-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:43:32):**  out there.  Because it's just a lot.  And I feel like we both, and honestly, I'm calling Hobbs out a little bit on this.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:43:42):**  I love him to death.  But I've actually kind of had some text conversations with him about, like, he gets a lot of flack  by your standard, you know, your run of the mill commodity guys.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:43:56):**  Whereas his practice is so refined and so sharp.  And he's got it between his ears.  Like he's got it.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:44:07):**  But the message gets totally lost in translation.  And this, I guess, goes back to the fact that the root of my degree is in communication.  Like sometimes you have to tone down your rhetoric, I guess you would say, or dumb it  
**[0:44:27-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:44:27):**  down to make an effective communication line between you and somebody else.  Because I feel like there's so many conventional producers out there that could so easily be  convinced to do what we do.  
**[0:44:43-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:44:43):**  It's just, they feel like they've been ostracized or put down by us.  Because when we tell people that grass fed beef is more healthy, grain finishing has  all kinds of issues, and feedlots are terrible, and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:45:00):**  They're like, well, why are you putting us down?  And I mean, I'm just as guilty.  I've done it.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:45:06):**  I've talked down about it plenty.  And there's two sides to that argument, too.  I mean, obviously-  
**[0:45:12-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:45:12):**  I think there's a difference between talking down and calling attention to some of these  production practices without trying to vilify anybody.  And that's a very difficult thing to do, to get somebody to think about a practice that  
**[0:45:33-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:45:33):**  they've been doing.  I'm doing it this way because this is how granddaddy did it, and my guy worked for him  and it's going to work for me.  
**[0:45:41-0:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:45:41):**  And just getting them to a mindset where they can challenge that paradigm.  It's very difficult without them feeling that they're being attacked.  I feel like that goes back to you have a lot of knowledge or you have a lot of experience,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:00):**  and it's really good to have both of those.  And it's these ranchers, they have a lot of experience, but are they still lifelong learners?  Are they trying to improve what they're doing?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:09):**  And it's funny that you say that about the word regenerative ag.  I thought that way when organics first started becoming popular and I was like, oh, I buy  this organic milk because I know it doesn't have antibiotics in it.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:21):**  And I was like, that's ridiculous.  Like, additional milk doesn't have antibiotics either.  It's just a lack of knowledge.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:27):**  There's so much greenwashing that happens on the marketing end of things.  This is why I tell people just don't trust labels, period.  That's why I love what you always say, Brian, is like, you need to shake the hand that feeds  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:41):**  you.  Yeah.  Because that's been my mantra forever.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:44):**  So I just say, you need to know your farmer.  You need to know your farmer.  Like farmers and ranchers are notorious for being people that like to be isolated.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:46:56):**  And as jovial and I don't know what other words I would use, communicative, I guess,  is as may seem on my TikTok videos or whatever.  Like I'm actually kind of okay with just being alone most of the time.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:47:18):**  And that's kind of-  Just you and the cows, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:47:21):**  Like, I mean, you got to think, okay, if I post six videos a day, that's a lot.  But that's six minutes of my life.  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:47:31):**  There's a lot of other hours that I'm spending pretty much in isolation.  And so I found that to be a nice balance.  But anyway, I didn't mean to divert.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:47:42):**  I just wanted to say like, when I say regenerative ag, I guess I have to also like deconstruct  my own mind because I feel like there's so many people that don't even know what regenerative  ag even is or means.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:47:59):**  But to me, it's just like common vernacular.  It's just like, okay, I mean, who doesn't know about regenerative ag?  It's kind of like the organic.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:48:10):**  It kind of means the same thing to me as what organic means to most people.  I don't know.  It's one of those things.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:48:20):**  I guess the root of what I'm trying to say is I just feel like there has to be-  somebody, and I'm not saying it's me, that can create some common ground between-  and I do feel like Gabe Brown does a really good job of that for the most part because  
**[0:48:38-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:48:38):**  he's been on both sides of that aisle when it comes to trying to take the blinders off  of people that are in the conventional ag space to the problems that exist there.  But there's also for every one of those, there is a whole lot of people that I'll just call  
**[0:49:01-0:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:49:01):**  them prophets of regenerative ag.  Like Joel Salatin is one who- I love Joel Salatin, but he is notorious for having an-  unless he's talking about the government, he's notorious about having an upbeat outlook  
**[0:49:19-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:49:19):**  on ag that is good for convincing young people to try it, to do it, but kind of paints a  rosy picture of all the possibilities and without giving enough warning of like, okay,  but you probably shouldn't just go out and mortgage a hundred acre farm because you can  
**[0:49:45-0:50:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:49:45):**  make all kinds of money doing this because you read one book.  So anyway, that's kind of where I'm at now.  I've just seen so many people, especially I guess in the homesteading community, they  
**[0:50:00-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:50:00):**  have fallen prey to that.  That's what I'm trying to, I guess, in my mind anyway, this is a conversation that I  have inside my own head is how do we overcome that?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:50:12):**  Like how do we bring truth or shine some light into like, okay, no, like in this way, the  conventional guys aren't completely like evil or wrong or whatever.  Like just because somebody doesn't do exactly- there's so much dogma, like that's, I guess,  
**[0:50:33-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:50:33):**  in the regenerative ag space and Hobbes is really good at flaunting the dogma of-  But he did mis-bust it.  He did mis-bust it when we talked to him recently and he was like, I'm not anti-conventional  
**[0:50:47-0:50:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:50:47):**  or anti-grain.  So I think he did talk about that really well where he was like, he doesn't want everyone  to think that.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:50:55):**  Yeah.  And that's-  I'd like to throw the term contextually appropriate management because we can agree that, you  
**[0:51:09-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:51:09):**  know, you're regenerative, I'm regenerative and there's other regenerative people in the  world.  And that means something different in Chickamauga, Georgia as it does in Barbara County, Kansas.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:51:17):**  And we're both applying contextually appropriate holistic management principles to achieve  those regenerative goals.  And I think that's the important part.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:51:27):**  And you know, if we're talking about the definition of regenerative, I think one thing that people  really need to be thinking about is it's not regenerative if you don't know who you're  passing it on to.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:51:42):**  And I think there's a lot of us that will call ourselves regenerative and not be able  to answer that question.  So I think that's a challenge.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:51:51):**  I think that's a little bit of a challenge, a little gauntlet throw down for everybody.  And it's something that we as an industry need to work on is how do we promote succession  and give some of these younger people some opportunity to get into livestock and animal  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:06):**  husbandry and the production of protein.  Definitely.  Absolutely.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:11):**  Because that to me, I mean, you know, Rancher Brim on TikTok.  I don't know if you ever intend to have him on here or not, but I figured you probably  would.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:22):**  Yeah, we're going to have him on here.  Yeah.  Well, Isaac and me have, like I actually just did, helped him.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:28):**  I haven't actually talked through it with him yet, but he's been asking me a lot of  questions and I kind of got on Google Earth and kind of designed his farm for him that  he just bought.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:39):**  Like, OK, like if I was going to if I had this place, this is probably without setting  boots on the ground.  This is probably where I'd probably put some more fencing.  
**[0:52:48-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:52:48):**  This is probably where I put some water points, like to move more efficiently.  I think that is the future.  Like we have to because there's a lot of people like him out there who I was once him like  
**[0:53:02-0:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:53:02):**  not that long ago.  And it's to me, that is going to be the succession of change that I think we see the most, because  as we said at the beginning of this, there are so many farmers that are.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:53:18):**  Sixty five plus.  In my opinion, not to throw too much shade on people, but like in my opinion, have already  proven that the succession plan really isn't their priority, that I feel like that burns  
**[0:53:34-0:53:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:53:34):**  us further, the younger people who have already gotten into it to like, OK, well, they dropped  the ball.  Let's see what we can do, you know, like to at least attempt to help the people who are,  
**[0:53:48-0:54:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:53:48):**  you know, 10 years behind us or five years behind us, whatever it may be, try to be that  instead of constantly looking back towards the older generation, like, well, why didn't  you do anything?  
**[0:54:02-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:54:02):**  You know, it's like, well, I'm in it.  You know, why can't why can't I take some time to help somebody that's new at it?  So circling back a little bit, though, Brian, I was just going to finish this thought that  
**[0:54:14-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:54:14):**  was living in the back of my head is I think what I'm wanting to see in the next 10 years  is not so much because I still think there'll be a lot of older farmers that clean our bitter  cleaners, you know, that just hang on.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:54:30):**  You know, everybody talks about like this exchange that's going to happen that all this  farm transferred.  I think that may actually last be a longer span of time that that takes than what some  
**[0:54:43-0:54:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:54:43):**  people say.  But either way, I would just much rather see conventional people that I mean, there's especially  around me.  
**[0:54:53-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:54:53):**  I don't know if it's the same where you're at.  There are so many people around here that are set stock that do no rotation.  I would much rather see somebody that's conventional has been conventional for 30 years say, huh,  
**[0:55:12-0:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:12):**  you feed a lot less hay than me.  Because I've had conversations standing down at the co-op before with other farmers and  tell them like, yeah, I didn't feed any hay last year.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:22):**  Oh, yeah, but you've got 400 acres.  It's because you got all that land.  Because around me, that's a big spread.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:30):**  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Where y'all at?  
**[0:55:34-0:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:34):**  It's like, oh, that's nothing.  But around me, exactly.  You go a couple hundred miles west and that's not even a gathering trap.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:45):**  Correct.  That's just like, that's a holding pen.  But, you know, where in my area, and that's what goes back to what you were saying, Brian,  
**[0:55:54-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:55:54):**  about contextual management.  Like it's very different.  But to talk to those old timers and be like, yeah, I didn't feed any hay last year.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:56:03):**  And like they want to come up with an excuse as to why you were able to do it.  That's outside of the realms of your management practice.  I would much rather convince those guys who are set stocking and feeding hay six months  
**[0:56:15-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:56:15):**  out of the year in an environment that gets 50 plus inches of rain.  To rotate their animals every week.  Hell, every month.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:56:25):**  Just something.  Just get a four block going.  Do something is better than nothing because it plants the seed of, oh, that's working.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:56:38):**  Well, what if we do?  What if we push that a little further?  And because I'm almost kind of reminded when I think about that.  
**[0:56:47-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:56:47):**  My agriculture teacher in high school telling me about the development of the land grant  university and the extension service and talking about how when the extension agent, because  the University of Georgia was the first land grant college.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:57:06):**  And so they were the first to like really go out into the community and try to sell,  if you will, the ideas of what they had researched.  And so I remember her telling a story about, you know, when they first set out with the  
**[0:57:21-0:57:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:57:21):**  extension agents to go convince these old time farmers that were growing corn on, you  know, 36 or 48 inch centers of rows, like, hey, you can bring that down to 16 inches  or 30 inches or whatever it was at the time and grow just as much corn plus the extra.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:57:43):**  What they had to do is they had to get creative because they were basically getting run off  people's land.  Is this the way we've always done it?  
**[0:57:49-0:58:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:57:49):**  This is the way, you know, my dad and his dad taught him and screw you.  And what they had to do was look at those people is look to the younger generation and  say, okay, well, your son who's 12.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:58:04):**  What if you gave him half an acre and just let and he follows our plan and you do the  rest how you're used to doing it.  Could you give that up to let him try and say yes.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:58:17):**  And then when he yields more than daddy did, daddy goes, oh, that's cool.  And so that's where I see us is the younger people, the people that are, you know, I would  say younger than 40 or around that that gauge is like the younger people and ag.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:58:38):**  It's our job to kind of shine that light forward.  But as you know, kind of looking back at what I already said is we can't leave people in  the dust like we've been left.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:58:50):**  Yeah.  I think I've really realized in the last couple years that I'm no longer on that younger side  of agriculture that I belong to the older side.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:00):**  You're listening.  You're on Tiktok.  You can't tell me that you don't belong in the younger crowd.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:08):**  I got even on Tiktok Brian.  Oh, young at heart.  Well, we'll have to work on your social media handles and you know, we'll have to talk about  
**[0:59:18-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:18):**  if you really want to do that or not.  It's a dark and if you want, I'm more than happy to help you.  I don't want to join the dark side.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:27):**  Stay off Twitter.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I've heard that.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:32):**  So that's funny.  Okay, sorry.  I was gonna say I remember talking to this rancher.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:42):**  I think he was in South Carolina and he was talking about how he has like rolling hills  and a bunch of like brush issues.  I'm like, yeah, well, like, maybe you can just rinse some goats for a month or so and  
**[0:59:53-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=0:59:53):**  get rid of that brush.  If that's what you want to do.  He was like, I couldn't imagine my neighbors seeing me with goats on my ranch and just  
**[1:00:00-1:00:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:00):**  like being so ashamed of the thought or the notion of the neighbors.  Yeah.  And I was like, okay, well, maybe you're not a good fit for me because like, I don't know  
**[1:00:11-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:11):**  how to work with you if you're not willing to, if you're just worried about what your  ranch or your neighbors are going to think.  So I think it is kind of crazy that people won't do things just because it's tradition  
**[1:00:20-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:20):**  or it's what are my neighbors going to think when they see I have goats here?  It's like, I'm getting rid of this brush and I'm going to be able to grow forage that my  cows can eat.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:28):**  That's what I'm doing.  Yeah.  But yeah.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:31):**  I'll second the other option would have been to take the boat vines and feed some hay and  Oh yeah.  Crazy high stock densities.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:43):**  I've had people do that with their sissel and stuff, just trample it down.  Yeah, that's good.  It's pretty, it's pretty rough.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:49):**  I've made my cows eat like a paddock of nothing but Bardock and Thistles and they weren't  happy about it, but they did it.  They did it.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:00:58):**  Yeah.  My Corianas, I turned them into a fresh paddock and I had this little six foot tall willow  tree in it.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:06):**  I turned them into a fresh paddock and you know, there's a bunch of them that fanned  out to go get the good grass and there were three of them that beelined for that willow  tree and in just a few minutes they had it stripped of green and I came back the next  
**[1:01:17-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:17):**  day and it was like it was a willow shrub.  Wow.  They took down the stem and everything.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:23):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're, they're good foragers.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:27):**  Yeah.  So let's talk grazing for a little bit.  Let's talk about how you graze and why and where you learned your grazing philosophy.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:34):**  Okay.  Well, I basically, my grazing philosophy is a mutt of where I learned it.  It's all kind of been just piecing together, much like my entire life philosophy.  
**[1:01:49-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:01:49):**  It's just piecing together the best things I can pluck from people that I respect.  And I think that's really all we can do.  Yeah.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:02:00):**  I mean, that's probably the best we can all do.  So as far as like how I graze, you know, like I literally get inundated with the question  all the time.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:02:12):**  It drives me insane.  You know, well, how long is it going to be before they come back there or how big is  the area they're in?  
**[1:02:20-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:02:20):**  And I'm like, well, that's like, it's not this like uniform, like squares that like  everything's the same all the time.  I'm like, that's just rotational grazing or can be, you know, like for me, I have figured  
**[1:02:36-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:02:36):**  out the hard way that right this time of year, I have to graze at a much lower density.  If I don't, I will destroy my ground.  I get lots of pug.  
**[1:02:55-1:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:02:55):**  We are on clay soils like that.  And so this is our wet season, like by far.  And thankfully, knock on wood, it hasn't been that bad.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:03:09):**  But last year was a fairly mild winter.  The winter before that was record breaking in rainfall.  And I basically disc harrowed with hooves a lot of ground.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:03:27):**  And the thing about doing that is that's all well and good from a disturbance animal impact  standpoint.  If you give that ground appropriate rest time, the problem is when you do that on clay soils,  
**[1:03:38-1:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:03:38):**  the appropriate rest time is probably in the neighborhood three to four years.  Oh, wow.  Because you create a hard pan.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:03:46):**  Right.  The dry season.  So like it's kind of it almost works in reverse the way you hear Alan Savory talk about, you  
**[1:03:54-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:03:54):**  know, defeating desertification in dry environments.  Well, I want to jump in here because I had a similar experience this year at at high  stock densities.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:04:06):**  And for me, that was pushing about 40, 42000 pounds an acre.  And my soils are sandy alone.  And the particular area that I'm going to talk about was farmed from probably sometime  
**[1:04:23-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:04:23):**  in the early 1900s till about mid 1950s.  I think it went back to grass in the in the 1950s.  So it was subject to a lot of wind, water erosion, a lot of topsoil has gone off.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:04:35):**  I mean, there's a little draw that's super productive.  The uplands are not so great.  Well, we ran a hot wire through this this hundred acre trap and we had a lane down to  
**[1:04:48-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:04:48):**  our strip grazing because that's that's what we make work.  And this is kind of the end of May right when my warm season grass is getting started right  when it's starting to wake up and we had like an inch and a half of rain.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:01):**  And then a cool day then we had another inch and a half of rain.  So I had three paddocks and this was 12 foot wide lane for 500 yards.  It was just plugged up and totally destroyed.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:12):**  And I'm thinking, man, this is going to be trash.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hang on.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:18):**  This is like an acre and a half on a 7000 acre ranch.  Little bus, right?  So I went back.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:27):**  I went back like at the beginning of June and it still looked like, you know, it just  looked hammered.  Okay, whatever.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:33):**  And we were grazing other parts of the ranch and it was July.  It was the end of July before I went back there and I got back there and in July and  there were seven foot tall, big blue stem.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:44):**  Right through the middle of that lane.  So again, this is one of those contextually appropriate things when people talk about,  you know, hugging and compaction.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:05:54):**  That means something very different if you're in a heavy clay soil or if you're in a sandy  loam soil.  Absolutely.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:01):**  That's that's that kind of story infuriates me, to be honest, because the fact that I  cannot do that and replicate that makes me so mad because I've.  Well, you can run 200 cows on 400 acres.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:15):**  I wish I could do that.  I was also going to say, you know, when you told me that high stock density for you is  42000 pounds, I'm like, that's my average all the time.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:26):**  All year round.  That's probably your winter rate, right?  Yeah.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:30):**  Yeah.  Right now, I'm running probably I'm probably not that high right now.  I'm probably at like 20000 pounds because I really have to scale back in the winter  
**[1:06:41-1:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:41):**  time.  But I mean, yeah, during the growing season, I definitely exceed 42000 pounds.  But I'm not I don't run half a million pounds all the time, like, like I probably should.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:06:56):**  But I would definitely say like, it's just one of those things where context really comes  into focus.  When it because I've gone to like, Greg Judy's grazing school, I've gone right now, I've  
**[1:07:10-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:10):**  taken the real wealth ranching course to you know, I've had Jim Garish come to my farm  and or mark and see that's another thing see here in southeast.  It's a farm.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:23):**  It's not a when you tell people like, oh, it's a ranch.  They're like, they think you're being pretentious.  Correct.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:31):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in the West.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:34):**  And they're like, if you're on the East Coast, you call it farm.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:39):**  You know, what's the memory?  Like, if you call it a ranch, like it's okay, but like to other farmers who are all yeah.  Like they don't like that term.  
**[1:07:50-1:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:07:50):**  It's like when it's a farm.  And I'm like, yeah, the last time this was actually a farm was probably the last cotton  crop they pulled off of it in the early 1900s.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:08:01):**  And that's, that's another contextual thing is like, our topsoil layer here is so thin  that yeah, that adds to the pugging aspect and the issues we run into.  So like, I always tell people, we aren't really farming topsoil at this point, like we're  
**[1:08:19-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:08:19):**  a we're effectively growing on a subsoil layer and trying to make the best of it.  Because most of our topsoil is long gone.  It's sailed down the creeks and the rivers, you know, eons ago, because I mean, my, my  
**[1:08:36-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:08:36):**  opera or my ranch, it has been an in operation since I know 1857.  And it was a cotton operation that they were plowing it with mules for cotton.  So and that's because there's a lot of history in our area Civil War battle, major Civil  
**[1:09:01-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:01):**  War battle was fought here.  And so there's actually some fairly good records of what was going on at the time.  And it's, it's so different.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:10):**  But when I see the kinds of improvements that can be made in drier environments from animal  impact, I'm not gonna lie to you, there is a part of me that's like, dang, I'm just gonna  move to Wyoming.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:26):**  Because it's just like, you know, like the possibilities is like, you could just give  me some dry desert land in New Mexico or like Utah or something.  It's like, what I could do with the animals I have now.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:41):**  Well, obviously, not those genetics, I would need different genetics.  But you know, the volume...  By thumb or mind.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:49):**  Yeah, exactly.  I think the Michonas could probably take it, but they're more tropical than they are desert.  So might have to look into getting some semen from that boron bull.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:09:59):**  There's definitely a case to be made though for...  For me, one of the long term plans I have is going to a far denser silvopasture system.  Because in my context, and I think silvopasture or the Savannah system works in most places,  
**[1:10:25-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:10:25):**  it just looks a little different.  Especially where you are, Brian, like, I know the cedar tree is the scourge of your existence.  The urge of the prairie.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:10:37):**  Yeah, we have them here too.  Every fence line I own has cedar trees growing in it.  So I know how that goes.  
**[1:10:47-1:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:10:47):**  But they're not quite as invasive to us because they're native than they are to you.  However, like that, the cedar tree is not a silvopasture tree.  You know, it's a kill everything under it tree.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:00):**  And whereas like there are trees that...  The only place I feel like silvopasture doesn't really work is the prairie.  The prairie didn't develop as a woodland ecosystem in any context, as far as I'm aware.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:16):**  However, like our environment definitely would have been heavily wooded with thick undergrowth.  And so that's kind of where I'm focusing my efforts towards the future.  I definitely would like to see a lot.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:32):**  I know if you're familiar with white oak pastures.  Yeah.  So, I actually...  
**[1:11:38-1:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:38):**  I'm a member of the Will Harris fan club.  Oh yeah.  I can...  
**[1:11:43-1:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:43):**  I want to be like Will Harris when I grow up.  Well, Mr. Harris offered me a job before I actually started doing this.  I went down there to... me and my wife went to a soil health like conference thing they  
**[1:11:57-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:11:57):**  put on there.  And I got to talking with him and he was like, you want to come work for me?  I was like, sure.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:12:06):**  And the only reason I did it is because I could not find a place to live down there.  But white oak pastures is essentially... so we're on the same highway, highway 27 runs  down the spine of West Georgia.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:12:21):**  And so we are on polar opposite ends of the state.  And their context is obviously a little different than mine.  And I just lost my train of thought of why I even brought them up in the first place.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:12:34):**  We were talking about Savannah.  Yes, thank you.  Sorry, I saw a squirrel.  
**[1:12:43-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:12:43):**  Like at the time, they had just planted like an ungodly amount of trees.  They planted like thousands of pecan trees on an 80 by 80 grid.  And that contextually for them is probably pretty accurate.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:13:02):**  I think I probably in my environment would probably stretch that a little bit more because  being a further north latitude, I'd probably be looking at 100 to 150 foot spacing on trees.  But that's kind of where my mind's at in the future because I definitely I've looked at  
**[1:13:22-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:13:22):**  like nut crop trees and things like that.  There's a lot of people out there, I know like Mark Shepherd.  He talks about that a lot, doing all kinds of crazy contour growing of fruit trees and  
**[1:13:37-1:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:13:37):**  nut trees and grazing pigs and then cows and all that kind of stuff.  And I'm all about some of that.  But I think sometimes, this is going to sound so punny, but sometimes you can lose sight  
**[1:13:51-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:13:51):**  of the forest for the trees.  In the regenerative ag space, I feel like there's so many things, so many rabbits to  trace and run down that like I've told some of my family members, like I have a list of  
**[1:14:04-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:14:04):**  things I want to try that's so long and so daunting that no one man could do it in six  lifetimes.  I'm like, I will eventually have to bring on people to be like, okay, I tasked you with  
**[1:14:19-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:14:19):**  this is your enterprise.  And that's kind of what Bill Salitan's done.  And I see that as being the model that grows that our space is that that's where we grow  
**[1:14:31-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:14:31):**  outwards is by bringing people in to further all the different causes that are all in association  with the reconstruction of our entire ecosystem.  Yeah.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:14:45):**  And someday, I hope we can see some of the large scale changes that we've been talking  about.  So what's one thing people can do right now to start making the world a better place?  
**[1:14:57-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:14:57):**  What's a simple change people could start doing today?  I would say meatless Mondays.  I'm going to edit that out.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:15:10):**  Kidding.  Definitely kidding.  I would say double your meat portion on Monday.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:15:17):**  And honestly, in all honesty, I would say seek out somebody that is local to you.  Of course, I'm a huge fan of true biodynamic organics, regenerative ag.  But some people don't have access to that.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:15:38):**  Like start with where you are.  If you have if you live in the corn belt of Iowa and you've got somebody that is right  down the road that's, you know, maybe a lot grain finishing some steers for the last 30  
**[1:15:53-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:15:53):**  days and your family needs beef.  Talk to that guy.  Consider consider buying something from him.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:16:01):**  Because if we don't I'm trying to rehome my own mind to get out of the box of the marketing  gimmicks and everything that gets sold to you when you walk into a Whole Foods of all  of everything great that's happening for the environment on this box that you know nothing  
**[1:16:21-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:16:21):**  about as opposed to knowing somebody that's boots on the ground and keeping your your  dollars patronizing with your local agriculture.  Because let's be honest, if if ag continues down the road that it's on, and it was it's  
**[1:16:38-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:16:38):**  far already far down the road, what we've done last year, shipping everything we produce  to somebody we don't know.  If we continue down that road, the economic impact of that leads to agricultural destruction,  
**[1:16:54-1:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:16:54):**  or that leads us to the ability for big corporate buyouts to come in and they don't need you  to run this operation, especially when you're talking about row crop production.  I mean, they're the technology is already in production, or exists to virtually eliminate  
**[1:17:13-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:17:13):**  all human hands from row crop production.  That's  I think we may see if they push hard enough, we'll see humans removed from the industrial  
**[1:17:26-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:17:26):**  commodity feedlot model as much as possible.  Absolutely.  I think it's gonna be a hard push to get the human beings out of the cow calf business.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:17:35):**  Yes.  But there's a point where everybody in the cow calf business either sells to the beef  business or becomes part of the beef business.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:17:42):**  And I think there's integration.  So very, very radical changes coming to the beef business.  I would absolutely agree to that.  
**[1:17:52-1:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:17:52):**  I think there are huge pushes in our industry, whether you be commodity based or regenerative  or somewhere in between, to essentially take us down the same road that they took dairy  down and that they took poultry down, is to make the commodity out of the individual,  
**[1:18:15-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:18:15):**  which Hobbs has touched on that before I know, and essentially make you a cog in the wheel  more so than we already are, and eliminate their liabilities, which is, let's be honest,  it's just good business, but it's really crappy for all the snowball effects that come out  
**[1:18:37-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:18:37):**  of that.  It may look good in a corporate boardroom when you're looking at the bottom line, but  the effects on public health, on psychological health, and then on the actual economic impacts  
**[1:18:56-1:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:18:56):**  of essentially federalizing all the economy of ag instead of keeping it localized.  I mean, if you just go through rural Georgia here, and I know it's pretty much the same  anywhere you go that's foreign country, the towns are dead.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:19:15):**  There's nothing there.  People have left their homes-  But who's doing good in those towns?  
**[1:19:21-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:19:21):**  The implement dealer, the seed dealer, and the crop insurance salesman.  Yeah.  Absolutely, because they have all convinced or sold to all these people that are losing  
**[1:19:35-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:19:35):**  money at the end of the year every year, and most of which would have... This is one thing  that I feel like really ruffles feathers, but it's absolutely true, and it's a hill  I'll die on, and me and Hobbs are both on it, is... And I know you're on it too, Brian.  
**[1:19:51-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:19:51):**  Is without the ripping away of tax dollars from citizens and redistributing it towards  commodity food production, the whole system falls apart.  No-  
**[1:20:07-1:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:07):**  Absolutely.  There is no... There's no... Or hardly at all.  I'm sure some exist.  
**[1:20:12-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:12):**  I'm sure there's a few out there, but for the most part, by and large, there are no  row crop production farmers in the commodity industry that produce at a profit without  government assistance.  
**[1:20:29-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:29):**  I will join you shoulder to shoulder on that hill.  But what a scary thought though.  What a scary thought though right now.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:37):**  Absolutely.  Without that assistance, they will fall apart.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:40):**  And so you don't realize that.  How scary.  Well, it's like I even had people that I'm friends with, local guys that were in the  
**[1:20:48-1:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:48):**  cattle business, who were telling me in the midst of COVID how much money I could get  from the government for just for having my cattle.  That's a thing or something.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:20:59):**  Yeah.  And I was like, I don't under... It's almost like a does not compute to me because I'm  like, I don't need the government's money.  
**[1:21:10-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:10):**  I'm okay.  And you don't know what the ripple effects are downstream from that.  This is the one thing, I do not get political at all on my social media platforms.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:22):**  I steer away from it heavily unless you're friends with my personal page.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:29-1:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:29):**  Yeah.  And I think that's a great policy.  Absolutely.  
**[1:21:33-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:33):**  I mean, I just feel like there's too much volatility on whatever side of the spectrum  you choose.  Right.  
**[1:21:41-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:41):**  Yeah.  And so I try to steer clear of that for the most part.  But the fact of the matter is we are in an industry that is essentially an extension  
**[1:21:52-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:21:52):**  of the government.  It has become one largely because there are so many controls in place and they're so,  like I said, it's propped up because the industrial model... And when I say us, I mean, we are  
**[1:22:08-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:22:08):**  cattle producers, ergo, we are attached to this, but obviously we know we're different.  But-  We're not beholden to that system.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:22:17):**  Correct.  But the industrial food model falls apart completely without government oversight and  funding.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:22:27):**  And that's where they get all their legitimacy.  So they're profitable because of the government and their legitimacy comes in the form of  certifications and oversight.  
**[1:22:38-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:22:38):**  Oh, it's USDA inspected.  It's great.  Okay.  
**[1:22:43-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:22:43):**  It came from Nigeria.  People don't even realize all the loopholes and the things that exist.  So I really think just going back to plant my flag in what you asked, Brian, is definitely  
**[1:23:00-1:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:23:00):**  my thing for one people... One thing that people can do is make one small purchase from  a local producer.  And I don't care if it's canned tomatoes or jam from a grandma that grows a big garden,  
**[1:23:18-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:23:18):**  or if it's buying a whole beef to put in your freezer from a local cattleman.  We have to re-patronize local agriculture because local agriculture is far more apt  to change and be nimble to the demands of the consumer and is not beholden to the big  
**[1:23:42-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:23:42):**  behemoth of the industry and federal dollars.  So that's how I-  And when you're buying food at a farmer's market, not from a corporate chain, when you're  
**[1:23:53-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:23:53):**  going to that farmer's market and you're talking to that farmer, that rancher, or the employee  that works for them, they have a vested interest in selling you good, clean, healthy food.  They are accountable to you in person right there at the farmer's market for the product  
**[1:24:13-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:24:13):**  they're selling you.  And that's something that's totally missing in the industrialized agriculture sector.  Yes.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:24:24):**  I mean, you are at best, at absolute best, you are four hands removed from, and I'm talking  in the beef model, of course with other production models it can be vastly different, but you're  at least four hands removed.  
**[1:24:40-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:24:40):**  And in all likelihood, probably more like six to eight hands removed from the guy that  actually saw that calf hit the ground to, thanks for shopping with us.  And that is something I think the internet stands to disrupt that a little bit.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:01):**  There's a lot of people who, some companies have gotten pretty big now.  I've railed on butcher box before because just up until, as far as I'm aware, like last  year, they were sourcing the majority of their beef from Australia.  
**[1:25:18-1:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:18):**  Selling it in the US is, they didn't falsely advertise.  They advertise it as grass fed, grass finished beef.  It's what it was.  
**[1:25:28-1:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:28):**  They just left out.  They just said, where?  Yeah.  
**[1:25:32-1:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:32):**  Convenient portion over here, sidebar, is we didn't even grow this in the country you  live in.  We grew it halfway around the world.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:43):**  It just blows my mind that people can think, can be brainwashed in the believing that that's  better when it has all that carbon costs for the transportation.  Because disregard production methods.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:25:59):**  I mean, just transporting meat halfway across the world really doesn't make any sense.  Well, it's bathed in diesel fuel.  And to me, once again, that goes back to, if we talk about the socioeconomic impact,  
**[1:26:13-1:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:26:13):**  we live in an era of cheap oil and subsidized oil, essentially, whether it be through tax  breaks or God knows what else.  Like, there's the whole, so that's what it's like.  
**[1:26:27-1:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:26:27):**  It's a deep, deep, dark rabbit hole.  But like when you really dive into just how much the tentacles of where tax dollars go,  and not only tax dollars, debt dollars, go to prop things up.  
**[1:26:49-1:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:26:49):**  It's fascinating to me that we have made it this far, to be honest, without some sort  of...  I mean, you would have thought that in, what was it under Jimmy Carter when they had the  
**[1:27:01-1:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:01):**  oil embargo?  If that happened today, we're done.  The whole system collapses.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:13):**  And so we have to...  The supply chain disruptions we saw in March and April would be like a love tap.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:24):**  Because I remember going to, I just had to, I went to Walmart.  It was probably in April.  I was like, I want to...  
**[1:27:33-1:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:33):**  I went to our local Walmart in the next town over.  I was like, I'm just going to go see.  I'm going to go see what's there.  
**[1:27:40-1:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:40):**  Immediately walked to the meat department and all that was there was beef jerky and  Lunchables.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:50):**  And that was it.  Yeah.  And...  
**[1:27:53-1:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:27:53):**  And lots of tofu and vegan stuff, right?  Yeah, of course.  But honestly, my wife, we went to Whole Foods later on, which there is a Whole Foods not  
**[1:28:04-1:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:28:04):**  terribly far from us.  We have to go to Chattanooga to go to it, but there was plenty of food in Whole Foods.  Because the difference is people that are of our mindset, that buy healthy food and  
**[1:28:20-1:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:28:20):**  whatnot, they weren't rushing to like, oh God, we got to clean the shelves.  That stuff still exists.  And honestly, even walking through the Walmart, most stuff that had a USDA organic stamp on  
**[1:28:33-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:28:33):**  it was still there.  And then that goes to show, and now not beef, because they don't even have that largely  where we live, but a lot of other, especially prepackaged foods, things like that.  
**[1:28:49-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:28:49):**  And so that was a very eye opening thing for me, both in understanding the community in  which I reside and who is acting like where the need actually is.  Because if you're faced with the idea of like, okay, my family needs to eat and there's no  
**[1:29:08-1:29:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:29:08):**  food, or I can spend a little more and get something that's basically the same as what  I was going to buy, but organic.  And you choose, well, we'll go to the McDonald's or whatever and get some McNuggets instead.  
**[1:29:25-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:29:25):**  That tells you a lot about your community.  And so if we're ever going to change as a whole, we have to focus on that.  And so that's why part of my drive in trying to open a processing facility is to hopefully  
**[1:29:41-1:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:29:41):**  get to a production standard one day where we can start working with those who are underserved  and kids that are...  There's so many kids that are in my county that are on free and reduced lunch at school.  
**[1:29:58-1:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:29:58):**  And there's all these statistics that show that that may be the only meal they get in  the day.  There's a lot of avenues I think we could chase with that, on the charitable side from  
**[1:30:11-1:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:30:11):**  a regenerative ag standpoint that I think...  I don't know.  I feel like we don't explore that enough.  
**[1:30:18-1:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:30:18):**  And that's something I've just recently started doing.  There's some folks around here that are doing that.  I think over the last school year, there've been several ranches that have donated halves  
**[1:30:31-1:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:30:31):**  to the school system.  It's awesome.  They just take the animal in and pay the processing fee or the processing fee is donated.  
**[1:30:39-1:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:30:39):**  Then they go down to the locker, pick the meat up and they take it to the school.  That's awesome.  And it's been a really positive experience for the guys that have done it and for the  
**[1:30:47-1:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:30:47):**  kids too, because it attaches a story to their food.  And it's overall theme we've been talking about.  Shake the hand that feeds the face of your farmer.  
**[1:31:00-1:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:31:00):**  Understand your supply chain and how that food shows up at the grocery store, if you  want to choose to support that model after you learn how many middlemen are taking profit  out between you and your farmer.  
**[1:31:11-1:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:31:11):**  I definitely think that that's something we need to work towards too.  As far as growing the next generation of agrarians, if you will, I think we need to start putting  that heavier focus of agriculture in our education system.  
**[1:31:32-1:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:31:32):**  And I don't mean to derail anything.  I just kind of wanted to bring that up because I definitely think, I know for me, if I had  not had the agricultural education I had in high school, I may have not had a stable enough  
**[1:31:48-1:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:31:48):**  foundation to be where I am today.  I may have not had that little burning ember in me blown on to strike fire.  So I definitely think that there's something to be said for that.  
**[1:32:05-1:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:32:05):**  And the more I think we can get kids hands in the dirt, I think we see infinite possibilities  come out of that.  Both like I said before, from a psychological perspective, from a health perspective, and  
**[1:32:21-1:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:32:21):**  from a non-health perspective.  I definitely think that goes, I guess that's the next step further down the chain as far  as looking back from where we are now.  
**[1:32:31-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:32:31):**  Is looking down the line and saying, okay, it's about the next generation, but it's also  about the next.  Like let's not forget the littles and teach them.  
**[1:32:44-1:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:32:44):**  There's going to have to be some crossover there.  So-  We have to build a culture of passing this, of building and passing this knowledge down.  
**[1:32:52-1:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:32:52):**  Absolutely.  And that goes back to what you said, CK, about so many ranchers and farmers are not lifelong  learners.  
**[1:33:01-1:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:33:01):**  And I think it's because we have a society that I won't say shies away from that, but  you're not really encouraged or a vast majority of people aren't encouraged to be lifelong  learners.  
**[1:33:15-1:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:33:15):**  Right.  You're encouraged to do this, be quiet, and know your place and do your job and fit your  little space, your little block in society.  
**[1:33:31-1:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:33:31):**  And that's where you need to be.  And I think Brian's fixing to bust out that.  He's laughing right there.  
**[1:33:38-1:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:33:38):**  But that's where we're forced.  And I'm not totally on board with the whole full pledge, like hippie commune, totally  free society, whatever.  
**[1:33:55-1:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:33:55):**  But I think there's definitely something to be said for allowing kids to express themselves  through the process of agriculture, because I think at its core, it is connecting with  nature and connecting with what makes us human in our experience here on this rock orbiting  
**[1:34:21-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:34:21):**  around this ball of fusion.  So that to me is vastly important that we work towards getting kids' hands in the dirt.  So anyway, I'll leave that at that.  
**[1:34:34-1:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:34:34):**  We can get off the education train.  No, it's been great.  And we've been going for quite a while.  
**[1:34:42-1:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:34:42):**  And we're kind of closing in on the end here.  Man, we've covered a lot of stuff, and I know we're going to have to have you back to cover  some more of these things.  
**[1:34:51-1:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:34:51):**  So let's turn the tables real quick.  It's your shot.  You can ask us a question or ask me a question.  
**[1:34:57-1:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:34:57):**  Okay.  Well, CK, I don't know you at all.  So you say you're in Kansas as well?  
**[1:35:06-1:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:06):**  I'm in Kansas right now.  My husband's from Idaho, and I'm actually from California.  But he's going to have a degree here.  
**[1:35:14-1:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:14):**  Okay.  Where do you plan to potentially start?  You're going to go back to Idaho just because it's not looking real fun going back to California  
**[1:35:22-1:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:22):**  at the time when you want to start a business.  I wouldn't name it there.  I would say what part of Idaho?  
**[1:35:32-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:32):**  So it's Wendell, Idaho, Gooding County.  It's 30 minutes from Twin Falls, hour and a half south of Boise also.  I use all those terms.  
**[1:35:40-1:35:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:40):**  South of Boise.  So it's dry country.  Yeah.  
**[1:35:43-1:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:43):**  It's sagebrush country and actually a lot of dairies are there too.  We're in the valley.  So we have more of a mild temperature than like somewhere in Stanley or something that  
**[1:35:53-1:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:35:53):**  has a higher elevation.  Yeah, we'll have to go visit Alder Springs.  Yeah, that's what everyone is telling me.  
**[1:36:02-1:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:02):**  I've been invited to his branch a couple times.  So I'm going to take it up next time when we move there.  Yeah.  
**[1:36:07-1:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:07):**  I actually texted Glenn today and asked if he'd be interested in coming on the show.  I haven't heard back from him yet.  I hope that by the time this airs, I'll have an answer from him.  
**[1:36:17-1:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:17):**  I'll get him to nudge.  They're cool people.  They've got some cool things going on.  
**[1:36:23-1:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:23):**  But I was actually told by Jim Garish at one point when he was here that they were voted,  I can't remember who he said by, but they were voted the best stake in the world by  somebody.  
**[1:36:35-1:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:35):**  This was years ago.  Some guy went on a quest to find the best stake in the world.  That's where they ended up settling on.  
**[1:36:45-1:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:45):**  And I've always been kind of following after them.  I feel like they do a lot of good things.  Yeah, they're good examples.  
**[1:36:53-1:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:36:53):**  Yeah.  And especially when you talk, like Brian, I know me and you have talked about this,  about what they do in terms of really bringing back the American cowboy and no fences.  
**[1:37:07-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:37:07):**  That is the in hurting and going out and living with the animals up in the mountains.  When I heard Glenn talk about that, I was like, I could get into that.  I could potentially leave this to just go do that.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:37:22):**  That sounds awesome.  Brian, I'll ask you a question.  I'm curious on what your goals are.  
**[1:37:31-1:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:37:31):**  So I basically only know you through the lens of TikTok and the conversations we have.  What are your goals as a rancher in terms of scale?  I know you say your place is like 7000 acres.  
**[1:37:48-1:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:37:48):**  But you do a lot of, is it custom grazing or are you leasing that property?  Custom grazing, so I take in cows.  Are your goals to eventually go all cow-calf?  
**[1:38:03-1:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:38:03):**  I just want to know what your goals are for your place.  I'm eventually heading towards multi-species grazing and cow-calf leading to direct marketing.  But there's always going to be some custom grazing in there in the mix because that's  
**[1:38:22-1:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:38:22):**  my richer custom grazing.  And yes, custom grazing is a good second base hit.  And like we discussed earlier, in the cow-calf business, you have a variable length payoff  
**[1:38:34-1:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:38:34):**  and that payoff at the end is variable.  You could start on a project now and in three years, the cattle market situation could be  completely 180 degrees from what we think it might be.  
**[1:38:47-1:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:38:47):**  May not have any processing plant or there may be another pandemic that happens that  completely changes the marketing dynamic.  So I think at the end of the day, we have to be adaptable and flexible as producers  
**[1:38:59-1:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:38:59):**  with not only our management, but with our marketing and have groundwork to where we  have a path that we can go down and we can either maybe swerve a little left or swerve  a little right, but we're not locked into our lane.  
**[1:39:17-1:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:39:17):**  So Michael, it has been absolutely fantastic to have you here with us.  It's been a great conversation and I definitely look forward to doing it again sometime.  So closing out, where can everybody find you on social media, any websites or products  
**[1:39:32-1:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:39:32):**  you want to take an opportunity to push real quick?  I have no products to peddle, only truth.  People can find me, we're pretty much, we're Reverend Wild Ranch on all social platforms,  
**[1:39:48-1:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:39:48):**  whether it's Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, though if you really want to see the day to  day, you're going to have to be on TikTok because Instagram and Facebook get ignored  a lot because that's not where the attention is.  
**[1:40:05-1:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:40:05):**  That's pretty much it.  But yeah, guys, I've enjoyed the crap out of this.  It's been great.  
**[1:40:09-1:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:40:09):**  So I look forward to talking to you again soon.  All right, Michael, it has been absolutely fantastic.  And thank you again.  
**[1:40:15-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:40:15):**  Thank you so much.  Yeah, thank you.  And CK, you want to take us out of here again?  
**[1:40:20-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/2-Michael-Kinsey-Double-Meat-Mondays-er4mdm#t=1:40:20):**  All right.  This is Rancin' Reboot with Michael Kinsey.  Talk to you guys later.

**[0:00:33-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:00:33):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher here with another episode of Ranching Reboot.  With me as always is my co-pilot, my hype man, my best buddy CK.  Today we're joined by Jeff Goodwin from the Noble Research Institute.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:00:56):**  Jeff, it's been a while.  How are you buddy?  Yep, Brian, CK.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:01:00):**  Glad to be here.  It's a pretty good time to be alive.  Every day you can get vertical and take fluids.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:01:09):**  I think that's what my dad said.  No doubt.  So tell us about Noble and Noble Research Institute first off for some context.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:01:20):**  Yeah, maybe the brief history is, we've been around since 1945.  We were founded by a gentleman named Lloyd Noble that he at the time was an oil and business  man from Southern Oklahoma.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:01:40):**  And he had the opportunity to, what was interesting about Mr. Noble in the 30s was that he was  one of the first people to have a plane.  So he had oil and gas exploration and all kinds of things all through the Southern Great  
**[0:01:58-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:01:58):**  Plains even into the Gulf of Mexico.  And he had the ability during the 30s to fly that country and see it all.  So you know what he saw in the 30s was the Dust Bowl.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:02:09):**  And so out of that, it was this passion to help the people that really helped him build  his business.  And one of the interesting parts of him building his business is that he employed folks that  
**[0:02:22-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:02:22):**  came from farming and ranching backgrounds.  And he always said they're the hardest working people he's ever met.  And so that really drove him to begin to have a passion for ranchers and that whole community.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:02:39):**  And so he built this foundation, started it in 1945 with an investment to help producers  better understand how to manage their soil resource.  And it just kind of grew from that.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:02:51):**  And so over the past 75 years, the consultation has been added, research has been added, a  lot of effort on land stewardship and outreach and education.  And in 2017, we went through the process of switching from the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation  
**[0:03:13-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:03:13):**  over to an ag research organization, an ARO structure where we're now the Noble Research  Institute.  And I guess more recently, about a couple years ago, a new president took over, Mr.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:03:29):**  Steve Rines, and he's really transforming our direction towards this area of regenerative  management.  And we've had agriculture specifically focused on rangeland and pasture land uses.  
**[0:03:45-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:03:45):**  Our theme now is to help producers achieve regenerative land stewardship and grazing  animal production with lasting producer profitability.  And so those are all things that ring true to most of our audience and the people we  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:01):**  work with.  And that's what we want to help producers achieve.  Awesome.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:08):**  So tell us about you.  Tell us Jeff's story, where you came from and how you got to be at Noble and what you  do for Noble.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:15):**  Yeah.  So I grew up on a ranch in Northeast Texas.  We moved around a fair bit, but I grew up there as a young kid until about the sixth  
**[0:04:29-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:29):**  grade and sort of was reared there, if you will.  That's still a word we use, but moved around a little bit in high school and ultimately  wanted to kind of get back to that ranching industry that I grew up with.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:46):**  I really enjoyed it.  So I went to college, got a bachelor's and a master's degree in range management from  Tarleton State University.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:04:55):**  At that time, it was going to be pretty tough for me.  The ranch we grew up on was a ranch that my grandfather managed for 30 years.  And so we didn't own an operation.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:05:08):**  And so I thought one of the best places for me to go was to begin to help producers move  down this track.  And so I went and worked for Texas AgriLife Research for a couple of years and I managed  
**[0:05:20-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:05:20):**  one of their experimental ranches in Vernon for a few years under Dr. Bill Pinchak.  Learned a lot.  After about two years, there was an opportunity to go work for the Natural Resources Conservation  
**[0:05:35-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:05:35):**  Service, NRCS, as a range land management specialist.  And so I thought, what better way to help producers than to see a lot of them and see  a lot of different operations and learn where people have made successes, where people have  
**[0:05:53-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:05:53):**  had failures, where the opportunity is moving forward.  And so I went to work for them and I worked for them for 14 years.  Worked my way up at probably seven different locations around the state of Texas.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:06:07):**  Ultimately, I ended up being the state range specialist for Texas.  And I was in that role for a couple of years, three years, I believe.  And then in 2016, Hugh Aljo enticed me to come to Noble.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:06:23):**  And so I left the agency, came to work for Noble and I've been there since 2016.  I serve now as a senior range and pastures consultant for them.  So I work with producers from all over Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, primarily the Southern Great  
**[0:06:40-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:06:40):**  Plains, but with our new vision, we're working towards a national footprint in our particular  space.  So we're growing as an organization and really trying to get our feet down on what are the  
**[0:06:55-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:06:55):**  questions we want to help producers ask and answer.  So what are some of those questions?  Well there's a long list, right?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:07:06):**  But really it's just, I think there's a lot of space here.  I mean, when we talk, when we back up and we start looking at soul health, several of  us, we've been working at this for decades, right?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:07:22):**  You know, soul health's been around for quite a while now and the science is really catching  up to the producers.  The producers are the ones that are getting this, this soil health on the ground and even  
**[0:07:34-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:07:34):**  the foundational sort of principles behind building healthy soil were largely developed  by producers.  And those weren't developed because producers, you know, they weren't spawned out of legislation  
**[0:07:51-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:07:51):**  or regulation.  It was spawned out of producers wanting to do things differently.  And you know, folks like Gabe Brown and others that really started to work down this path,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:08:04):**  you know, interestingly, a lot of them were cropland producers, but they wanted to mimic  a functional, highly productive rangeland ecosystem.  You know, they wanted to have plants year round.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:08:18):**  They wanted to keep the ground covered.  They wanted to have a lot of diversity and integrate livestock.  And that was the basis for a lot of their principles.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:08:26):**  And so, you know, when it goes back to sort of what questions do we want to answer?  Well, most of that work historically has been done from a soil health perspective over the  last 10 or 15 years on cropland land uses.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:08:41):**  And there hasn't been a tremendous amount of effort on the range and pasture space with  that focus.  Right.  
**[0:08:48-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:08:48):**  We've been doing range and pasture research for 100, you know, probably 50 years, 60,  70 years.  But has it had that emphasis on, you know, soil microbial communities or land regeneration  
**[0:09:02-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:09:02):**  or you know, all these metrics that we look at now from a soil health perspective?  I just think there's a lot of questions we can help answer from a producer's perspective.  Namely, what are we supposed to measure?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:09:16):**  You know, what do we measure?  How does our management then impact that metric?  And then how do we really realize that understanding at a scale that's relative to a producer that's  
**[0:09:29-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:09:29):**  managing multi-section operations?  You know, the things we learn at a plot scale don't always translate to the pasture.  Scales that are relative to producers are really important.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:09:44):**  And you guys are starting to do some of that.  And getting out of the small research plots, you guys are actually out doing ranch scale  experiments now, aren't you?  
**[0:09:52-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:09:52):**  We are and we've got a number of projects that we're working on moving toward really  looking at these landscape scale type efforts.  Moving, you know, I talked to my friend, Dr. Richard Teague, and he, you know, one of the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:09):**  first things he'll always say is go study the people that are doing it right, you know,  and study them on their ranches.  And instead of comparing, you know, X, Y, Z treatment to X control, where do you find  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:24):**  a control in nature?  There isn't one.  And so you're comparing this to that, which is important at some point, but let's do it  
**[0:10:32-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:32):**  at a scale that's relative to people and how they can understand.  And then we can begin to understand the ecological side.  And often I think the science part is the easy part.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:44):**  It's when we bring in the social dynamic.  Oh, absolutely.  Mm hmm.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:48):**  People is what really drives the decision making.  And that's the hardest part of all of it.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:10:54):**  And most often overlooked or just set aside.  Oh, we'll get to that later.  We got to go work hours today or, you know, we got to go fix that fence.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:02):**  Do you remember, Jeff, we were sitting down as the end of NCBA in San Antonio and there  was some producer came by, wanted to know about our software.  And I remember just asking him very basic questions of like, do you rotationally grace?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:16):**  And he's like, why would I do that?  And he's like, he had, he was, I don't, I was like, oh, um, you know, blah, blah, blah.  But it was as a mindset thing.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:25):**  It was like, I don't know why I would do that.  I would make my life harder to have to move them more often.  And it's like, well, you're probably checking them every day.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:32):**  Right.  And he's like, yeah, I check them every day.  And I was like, well, then just move on when you check them.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:36):**  But it is, it's a, it's a people problem.  When you're out there checking them every day and they're used to you, you do something  a little bit different.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:44):**  Tease them a little cake, you know, open the gate, honk a horn.  They'll notice that behavior and they'll want to come to you.  It always comes back to the space between our ears.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:11:54):**  You know, it's, and that's one of the things that we're trying to focus on and others are  focusing on it too.  It's removing the barriers to adoption.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:03):**  So if there's a barrier in front of them to adopt a management strategy, like regenerative  ranching, there may be an economic barrier.  There may be a social barrier, barrier.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:18):**  There may be an educational barrier where they just don't understand how to do it or  a lot of times tradition drives a lot of that.  You know, we've all done this this way for a long time.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:29):**  We've been somewhat successful.  Why do I want to put that much risk on me right now?  Well, then you need to sit back and really start analyzing what risk really looks like.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:40):**  Yeah.  What is your opportunity cost?  What is a missed cost?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:44):**  Yeah.  I think there's a great amount of risk in continuing what we're doing today and not  looking for new challenges.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:12:51):**  That's what the biggest risk lies to me.  Is simply staying sustainable and not looking for a better way.  I think sustainability is, should probably be maybe removed from our vocabulary.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:13:05):**  I think so too, because it's like you're sustaining, you're staying almost stagnant, right?  It's you're not moving or challenging your ecosystem.  That's challenging.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:13:14):**  Anytime a word is coined, I think that that movement had had the best intentions when  they started.  It's just that when you look at the root of that word, as far as you know, we want to  
**[0:13:26-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:13:26):**  maintain what we have.  That's the sustainability.  And from a soil carbon perspective, I think there is some points that, hey, let's maintain

**[0:13:43-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:13:43):**  We've got to regenerate these landscapes.  So we work towards building and regenerating them over time.  So that's a forward thinking mechanism that I think is somewhat hard to grasp at times,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:13:56):**  but it's the direction we've got to go.  So how can we build carbon?  What are some of the ways that we can start to build carbon back out on our perennial  
**[0:14:08-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:14:08):**  pastures?  It's interesting, this whole idea around soil carbon.  It's contextual.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:14:21):**  It does matter where you are.  The environment plays a key role in its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon.  Interestingly, when we look at where the carbon is on the planet, there's about 750, they  
**[0:14:39-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:14:39):**  call it petagrams.  One petagrams of 1 billion tons.  There's 750 petagrams or billion tons of carbon in the atmosphere.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:14:49):**  And that's what most people think of when you talk to any person off the street and  you say carbon, they're going to think of CO2, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  But when you look at the, or they think about vegetation, the trees, the rainforest, the  
**[0:15:07-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:15:07):**  trees, and there's about 580 billion tons of carbon in the vegetation.  When you look at the top three feet of soil on the surface of the earth, there's about  1500 billion tons of carbon in that top meter.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:15:23):**  And so there's more carbon in the top meter of soil on planet earth than there is in the  vegetation and the atmosphere combined.  And so where do we have our greatest impact on planet earth?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:15:33):**  The top three feet of the soil surface, right?  There's opportunities there.  Again, when we start talking about the act of sequestration, it's not something that  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:15:45):**  you go stick a probe in the ground and you can pull out a sample and say, look how much  we sequestered.  It's a rate over time.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:15:52):**  So you have to stock now and then you implement some management, then you measure it at another  time.  And the result is whether you're a sink or a source, right, whether you've actually sequestered  
**[0:16:04-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:16:04):**  or not.  And I think there's a number of different things that we can do to help ourselves.  There's a paper from Sanderman that was put out in 2020 and he looked at sort of three  
**[0:16:20-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:16:20):**  primary pathways of sequestering carbon in Western rangelands.  And one of those was certainly stopping land use change, quit plowing the Prairie for one.  And so when we start looking at fragmentation and land use change across the country, it's  
**[0:16:43-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:16:43):**  a big deal.  Landscapes being plowed out to go to corn or whatever it is, land use change is certainly  an issue.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:16:54):**  The other is converting some of these degraded, sort of already converted landscapes back  to perennial pasture, whether that's a CRP program or a producer wanting to take crop  land and put it back into perennial grass.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:17:08):**  I mean, we build carbon with roots and that's how we do it.  We get roots in the ground year round.  And then this last sort of area that he mentioned was really just adaptive livestock management,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:17:23):**  grazing management.  And there's a lot of research going on right now in the area of the methods and the management  behind what is our ability and capability of using livestock as a tool to then increase  
**[0:17:40-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:17:40):**  ecosystem function to ink and carbon sequestration, certainly one of those services.  Again, it goes back to context.  This depends on how wet and dry your climate is, how dry or hot.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:17:58):**  When we tend to get into cooler climates like North Dakota, for instance, where it's pretty  dry and pretty cool, it's pretty easy to sequester carbon.  When you get into a more wet environments where we're just using that carbon so much  
**[0:18:15-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:18:15):**  faster, the biology are using it that much faster, it's harder to sequester it because  it's being used by life.  And then when we go west in a much drier climate where the energy turnover is much slower,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:18:32):**  it's a little harder to do it there.  Can be done, it just takes longer.  So I think the idea of using livestock grazing management, all the tools we have available  
**[0:18:48-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:18:48):**  to us, but have the objective of increasing organic matter, which is 58% soil carbon,  should be an absolute objective for all of our producers.  Because there's a whole lot of other benefits other than increasing carbon sequestration.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:19:07):**  When we increase organic matter, we aggregate, the soil becomes more aggregated, it becomes  more porous, we get more rain infiltration into the soil.  We clear water.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, we clean our water.  And so when we talk about carbon sequestration, to most producers, I don't say that word.  We talk about those ancillary benefits of building resilience and helping risk assessments  
**[0:19:35-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:19:35):**  to drought mitigation and all those things are all benefits in doing that.  One of our previous guests, Russ Konzer from Blue Nest would have been last week's episode.  He likes to say that the best indicator of rangeland health is birds.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:19:55):**  Because you can fake out a lot of things.  You can fake out an auditor.  You can do a lot of things to make your place appear better than it is.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:20:05):**  But if you don't have birds, you're doing something wrong.  I think that's great.  And Russ is a really smart dude.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:20:15):**  He's a really smart individual and knows this stuff inside and out.  And I couldn't agree more.  We look at most of the, you know, we look at the species that are imperiled in the Great  
**[0:20:28-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:20:28):**  Plains, they're all birds.  Most of them are grassland birds that are dependent on these diverse sort of landscapes  that have somewhat, you know, to some extent or the other been degraded over time.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:20:42):**  And that habitat structure is no longer there.  That supports that individual species.  So looking for things that, you know, these species that inhabit those higher sort of  
**[0:20:54-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:20:54):**  tropic levels or higher climactic situations of plant communities.  That's a really good indicator for rangeland health.  I agree.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:06):**  I also think another one when we get down to it, and I'm gonna laugh when we spend millions  and millions of dollars of, you know, research funding, and we boil this whole thing down  to we need less bare ground.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:21):**  You know, I mean, it could literally get up there.  Yeah.  As simple as that, right?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:29):**  But it is, I mean, it's true.  But it's funny that we need research to validate that.  So yeah.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:36):**  That is true.  What do you think about, so like, I'm talking with regenerative ranches, and they've been  doing it for 10, 20 years.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:47):**  Do you think that their soil saturation of carbon plateaus or because, or no, as far  as those deltas?  So I think it all determines...  
**[0:21:59-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:21:59):**  The management, right?  Well, I think it goes back to how are we testing?  Yeah.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:22:08):**  So if you're taking a loss on ignition soil organic matter test.  Right.  And that's only going to kind of give you one sort of lens at what the organic matter  
**[0:22:18-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:22:18):**  viewpoint is.  What we're learning now is that organic matter needs to really be fractionated out into its  into other segments like the particulate organic matter and the mineral associated organic  
**[0:22:32-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:22:32):**  matter, because those are two different pools.  And some of the work that Dr. Francesca Cutrufo and others are doing through Colorado State,  they're beginning to see that some of those pools begin to stratify off or level off at  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:22:47):**  like 10%.  And so if we ever get to 10%, we're all going to be jumping up and down.  Exactly.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:22:54):**  Right.  But these other pools, these other pools aren't even leveling off.  And so they haven't even seen the top of it.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:02):**  Like where we're at, right?  The Great Plains, we're a huge carbon sink.  And if we get to the point where we're plateauing, like you said, at that 10%, we all should  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:12):**  go take a vacation because we just fixed 100 years worth of degraded.  We win.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:20):**  I don't think we're there for 50, 100 more years.  Like it's going to take a long time before we see a plateau.  And I guess I just have a hard time having that conversation when they're like, we've  
**[0:23:31-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:31):**  been doing this for 20 years.  Does this mean we're losing?  When it's like, no, you're actually like at a more, like it's more consistent and the  
**[0:23:40-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:40):**  risk isn't, the Delta may not be there, but I don't know.  I think if Christine Jones's work, I really like what she says about soil saturation.  And it doesn't take a very large percentage change.  
**[0:23:51-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:23:51):**  Like it's fractions of a percent organic matter is tons of carbon per acre.  Like it's not that, you know, you've got to have a 4% jump to have two tons an acre.  No, it's like, it's a couple of tenths of that percent is going to give you tons per  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:07):**  acre jumping carbon.  Yeah.  I mean, I tend to agree.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:11):**  I mean, people sort of downplay the opportunity of sequestering carbon in the West.  Just because that system turns over at a slower rate, but we make it up in the extent.  I mean, in terms of 700 million acres of that across the country, I mean, we start increasing  
**[0:24:31-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:31):**  a couple of tenths or a half a percent over a number of years and we make up some ground.  But this idea of saturation, I will never see it.  Thank you.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:43):**  I just needed you to say that.  We probably won't live long enough.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:50):**  Yeah.  We've gone the other direction for way too long.  Way too long, way too fast.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:24:59):**  First thing we got to do is get our foot off the accelerator and figure out how to get  it shut down and find reverse.  I agree.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah.  And then put the pedal to the metal in the other direction.  So what are some great resources you want to talk about?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:25:19):**  I mean, you can talk about NOBEL obviously, but what are some other resources and other  trainings and things that you've experienced that have definitely, that have helped broaden  your experience in the regenerative sphere?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:25:31):**  So NOBEL's moving in this direction and we're trying to soak up as much information as we  can from all of our producer network.  We're going to learn more from the producers that are doing this.  
**[0:25:46-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:25:46):**  We own and operate 14,000 acres in Southern Oklahoma and run a number of cows and we're  transitioning our properties into this direction too.  So we're learning as we go, but we're also learning while we walk the same path with  
**[0:26:01-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:26:01):**  other producers.  But as far as other outlets, I'm certainly interested in hearing from folks like Understanding  Ag.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:26:13):**  I think they bring a lot to the table.  Their consultants are largely producers too.  They've got a strong producer background that just, it's practical and the information is  
**[0:26:31-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:26:31):**  easy to understand.  So there's a number of folks that, I look at some of the scientific literature too,  some of the stuff that Jason Roundtree's publishing, Francesca Catrifo, Richard Teague.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:26:50):**  The thing about research is you need to take it in, but then you need to see if it applies  to your context because not everything is going to apply to you in your context.  Just because it applies something, just because it may work in some area doesn't necessarily  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:07):**  work.  It's going to mean it's going to work the exact same way for you.  It doesn't mean it won't work.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:12):**  It just means it may be different.  You may get to that outcome a little differently.  Another outlet that I think everybody ought to explore a little more is, every time I  
**[0:27:25-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:25):**  go through the course and listen to Dallas Mount at Ranching for Profit, he will speak  all day long about regenerative ranching and never say the word regenerative.  Exactly.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:36):**  Exactly.  That's what I love about it.  But that's also how people adopt it, right?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:42):**  They don't want to be greenwashed into regenerative.  They just want to see the economic value of changing something or producing force, just  low cost and you're not relying on outputs.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:27:54):**  I like that.  Sorry.  Interjected.

**[0:28:10-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:28:10):**  Dallas just brings a perspective that is extremely relatable.  And then the whole executive link group of producers.  It's pretty outstanding.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:28:26):**  I can tell you from personal experience, it is a fantastic network to be in.  Like the executive link network.  I could post a question on a Facebook group.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:28:36):**  I might not always get an answer within a day or two, but a few days, I'll have several  great answers and have a good direction to go.  So it's a very, very supportive network.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:28:47):**  Yeah, one of the top ones.  We need more of those, or at least more people either involved in that one or building just  local networks among producers that are close to you.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:28:59):**  A lot of the most of the time that when we see successful efforts, it's because people  have gotten together and exchanged ideas and you learn from one another.  And it just, everything just works better when you hear multiple perspectives, multiple  
**[0:29:18-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:29:18):**  ideas, and then you take what works, what you feel like will work for you home and try  it.  And maybe it's 80%.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:29:26):**  Like, I think, you know, 80% of almost all of these regenerative principles can apply  to everybody's context.  But your 80% might be completely different from the neighbor across the fences.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:29:39):**  80%.  But you can still agree that you're doing positive things for the soil, for the health,  and for your animals.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:29:46):**  Yeah.  I mean, no one's going to agree 100% of the time, but if we can agree on 80, that's a  strong B, I'll take it.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:29:54):**  Yeah.  That's a good second base hit, I think.  Dee's got degrees in college, so yeah.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:01):**  Yeah, I guess if you had that college degree, it doesn't really matter what your grades  were as long as you got the paper, right?  So sad.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:14):**  So this is, I mean, it is a new direction for Noble.  I've been kind of familiar with Noble for all about the last 15 or so years.  And sometimes it's been a little frustrating because, you know, I'm in Southern Kansas  
**[0:30:29-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:29):**  and until just a few years ago, Noble liked to stay within about 90, you know, 80, 90  miles of Ardmore.  I think it's great you guys are branching out and broadening your reach and trying to  
**[0:30:40-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:40):**  reach some more people.  Yeah.  Historically, I mean, for the longest time, Noble had a 100 mile radius of Ardmore.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:49):**  So they basically worked from Oklahoma City to Dallas, Fort Worth and sort of a circle  there.  And then, you know, as leadership changes, priorities change.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:30:57):**  We had a new president, Bill Buckner came in, you know, six or seven years ago now and  basically said, no longer, no longer, we're not going to work under that framework anymore.  We're going to focus on the Southern Great Plains.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:31:12):**  And then now we have a new president that says that's not big enough.  We're going to look at the continental United States and have a footprint.  And, you know, there's 750 million acres of range and pasture out there on grazing lands.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:31:27):**  And we want to have an impact on it.  So I just, I love that challenge.  It's also, it says, speaks to your confidence.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:31:35):**  You know, you started with 90, did the Great Plains and now you're scaling, you know, you  scaled.  So that's a sign of success is you guys really know how to do what you're doing.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:31:46):**  Well, and it's a challenge too, because anytime you scale up, there's new challenges.  And the strength of being able to do that is going to be on building good collaborations  with really smart people in other parts of the country.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:32:04):**  And it's just a matter of trying to get the right people at the right table, because we're  not going to be able to answer every question.  We're not going to know the answer to every question.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:32:14):**  But I think a challenge for us is to help producers in areas, find the right solutions  for them.  So, we've kind of danced around people and we're talking about people.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:32:29):**  And you know, people in community, that's what we really need to be thinking about is  how do we build these resilient communities that are, how do we build these resilient  communities?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:32:43):**  How do we get more people on board?  Yeah.  I first think, you know, if our goal is to get more people regenerating the landscape,  
**[0:32:54-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:32:54):**  if you will, we've got to remove the barriers, whatever barrier there is that is in it.  They're all individual barriers.  They're, you know, my barriers to moving into this area would be different than my neighbor  
**[0:33:09-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:33:09):**  likely, or someone in Kansas or Arkansas.  And so, but they're largely either economic, informational, educational, or some kind of  a socio economic tradition type barrier.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:33:22):**  And so, you know, focusing efforts around removing those barriers, I think is step number  one, you got to make it to where there's an open door that someone can walk through and  make it, you know, it's got to be an opportunity that's not, you know, that doesn't intimidate  
**[0:33:39-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:33:39):**  people.  They need to be able to or willing to try and it's not just trying, you know, you don't  have to jump into this thing with both feet, sell every piece of equipment you got and  
**[0:33:51-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:33:51):**  start small.  Well, let's close one gate.  Start by closing one gate and start providing some rest.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:34:01):**  I mean, when we get into this grazing thing, you know, from a grazing perspective, starting  in a grazing management plan, I mean, I truly believe what Alan Savory often says is make  a plan and then assume you're wrong, because you're probably are.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:34:18):**  And it takes that constant monitoring, close one gate, provide some rest and move on.  The whole make a plan and assume you're wrong mindset.  That's just so contradictory, though, to what most people are taught their whole lives.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:34:35):**  Yeah, they're often taught that there's a book of values and you look the book up, you  see this, the RNC value or the or whatever, whatever recipe for success you want to use.  There's a cookbook out there somewhere that is going to get you there.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:34:52):**  And there really isn't.  There's a suite of principles that we try to follow.  But the application of those principles on any individual operation is going to be different.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:35:09):**  It's having the flexibility to change when you need to and be adaptive in your responses.  That's what's going to give you the flexibility moving forward is your ability to be adaptive  and change to whether it's weather, a market, whatever it is.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:35:28):**  That's what we've found that has been successful for most producers is that, well, for one  thing, they stopped producing a commodity and started producing a product and really  opened other doors that they didn't really know were there.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:35:45):**  Let's talk a little more about that.  What do you mean by stop producing a commodity and started producing a product?  Well, if you're producing a commodity, you're selling it on a commodity market.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:35:56):**  So you're a price taker, not a price maker.  And so if you back up and look at the product that I'm producing, and as a rancher, your  product is grass.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:36:10):**  And you have a livestock animal that is converting that forage into some kind of a saleable product.  Is it wool?  Is it beef?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:36:20):**  Is it lamb?  Whatever it is, find a solution and a market and an opportunity for you to determine what  the price of that is.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:36:32):**  And it's not easy.  And it's not easy to see if you've never done it.  But man, there are organizations and folks out there now that, like Gray's Cart and some  
**[0:36:44-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:36:44):**  of these other groups that can help you establish opportunities.  And with the internet and online sales now, there's a lot of our producers that have gone  wholly to just selling local.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:36:59):**  And they're doing quite well, much better than they used to be just hauling everything  once or twice a year to the sale barn and hoping for a good day.  I think what I've found by doing the numbers is you don't have to direct market very many  
**[0:37:17-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:37:17):**  animals to make a huge difference in your bottom line.  Yeah, absolutely.  You don't have to worry about trying to, if you're a 500 cow outfit, you don't have to  
**[0:37:29-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:37:29):**  think about how am I going to market 250 calves?  No.  I mean, pick your best few out, finish them yourself, sell direct, and you're going to  
**[0:37:40-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:37:40):**  get so much margin off of them rather than selling in the commodity feedlot system, you'll  probably start changing the way you do business.  And like you mentioned, we have to find these places where people can make a small change,  
**[0:37:57-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:37:57):**  where I guess make a small enough experiment where if it fails, it's not going to take  you completely out of business, but if it succeeds, it will teach you invaluable knowledge.  Just take one of your fields and try some cover crops, try grazing them on the 10 acres  
**[0:38:18-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:38:18):**  that are close.  Is it Ian Mitchell Eanes?  He says that if you want to try something, try your worst 50% of the land if you're in  
**[0:38:28-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:38:28):**  fear of failure and then lease the other half.  So at least you know you have something paid for.  And that could be a solid model for somebody that's got a ranch that's half and half.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:38:42):**  Take the degraded half and fence it off and try to run an ultra high density on at least  the other half for some cash income.  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher here in the editing booth.  
**[0:38:52-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:38:52):**  I apologize for the break in the conversation, but as Jeff said at the beginning, there was  some weather coming in, so it disrupted us for just a few minutes, but he came right  back and we're going to pick up with that conversation right now.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:39:07):**  And where were we?  We were talking about getting producers to realize some quick wins.  Okay.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:39:16):**  What are the quick wins that we can help producers move down this road?  I think one of the things too that's a potential or that is perceived as a potential bottom  neck in moving into some opportunity where you might want to direct market something  
**[0:39:34-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:39:34):**  for us has been local processing for livestock side.  It's been a bit of a bottleneck.  COVID didn't help that.  
**[0:39:47-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:39:47):**  There's people that couldn't find a processing date 12 months out.  And so, but because of that, there's like 13 new processing plants being built in Texas  currently.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:40:01):**  And so, and I suspect there'll be more.  And so to me, crisis ultimately a lot of times pushes folks towards a new endeavors and it's  an opportunity now.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:40:18):**  I've seen a lot of it's crisis is really, I said that wrong, but crisis really fix you  or force you to deal with your problems, to deal with their conflicts or if there's a  bottleneck.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:40:31):**  So the processing shortage or whatever.  Okay, well, we got to solve this now because I can't wait another 12 months for the next  time this happens.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:40:39):**  It's one of those things too.  When we talk about ranching and regenerative in this new direction or regenerative direction,  it's not really new.  
**[0:40:51-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:40:51):**  This idea that you've got to be in a crisis before you'll change because we've heard,  I mean, even Gabe Brown talks about his transition is they had these years of droughts and that  really drove them to look at things differently.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:41:09):**  And I think Deborah and Emory, Deborah Clark and Emory Burble have a similar story where,  you know, drought and flood really made them combine their herds.  And now look at the cool stuff they're doing with animal impact and managed grazing.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:41:25):**  And what I really want us to get a move away from it.  They're having to be a crisis.  I know.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:41:33):**  Actually moving this direction.  Well, I guess as crisis is go, you know, it, some people would call Anderson Creek wildfire  that happened to me five years ago, a crisis.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:41:50):**  No, no, that was an opportunity that was a blessing in the skies.  Yeah.  The work to rebuild all the fences, rebuild all the gates.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:41:57):**  That wasn't very much fun, but the benefits that I've seen since.  You know, take advantage of a crisis, take advantage of that energy of a crisis to leverage  your way to a new level.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:42:13):**  I think almost all of the producers that have moved through this process and have emerged  as a champion after it would all say the same thing.  That was the best thing that ever happened to us, you know, but man, the day it happens,  
**[0:42:26-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:42:26):**  it doesn't get a little different story you're telling.  You know, it's with the anything in life is, you know, the, the, the challenges that you  face ultimately define your character and, and, and what kind of person you are.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:42:40):**  I would agree with that.  Yeah.  I shared my story last week and I think that was like the main thing too, is you can get

I think you made kind of a tasty margarita out of yours.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah.  I love margaritas.  That was, that was a great episode.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:08):**  And if you're listening to this and you haven't caught that, make sure you go back and listen  to ranching reboot special number two with CK.  She's cringing right now.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:19):**  That's all right.  No, there's just a lot.  It's a lot.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:22):**  So I've gotten really good positive messages, so I appreciate it.  But I definitely just ripped off the bandaid and revealed who I really am.  And you know, I think it's a good time to mention that.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:33):**  I think that's something that's a trait that I've noticed that a lot of people in a regenerative  sphere aren't afraid to be vulnerable with, with others in the industry and share some  of their failures and share some of their background and share some of the lessons they've  
**[0:43:51-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:43:51):**  learned.  And you don't, you don't necessarily get that at the co-op and feed store culture, right?  You know, they just want to brag about how many, you know, how heavy their calves were,  
**[0:44:00-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:00):**  what their yield numbers were, the death or whatever disease they talk about just the  good stuff, like how much you got for the calves this into cell barn.  I've learned way more in my life by failing than I ever have by succeeding.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:16):**  Yep.  And then it's just, you know, it's just this idea of, of, you know, you can go back to  planning and doing.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:25):**  We don't learn about planning.  Planning helps us to be more successful, but we learn by doing.  And our actions are where we ultimately either succeed or we fail.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:39):**  Now proper planning can sure help us limit those failures, but sometimes, you know, shit  happens.  I don't know if I can say that word, but it does.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:49):**  And how you get through it is what matters.  I didn't get to the bleep button fast enough.  You're good.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:44:55):**  Well, it's so like what you said with Alan Savory is, uh, assume your plan is wrong.  And it's like, I think really what is getting down is don't be afraid of it.  Don't be afraid to make a plan because yeah, it is probably going to be wrong, but it's  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:45:14):**  worse if you do nothing.  Like it's, it really is.  And it's something that was kind of a mantra in my household is the worst thing you can  
**[0:45:21-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:45:21):**  do is do nothing and say nothing because who's, how are you going to get something solved?  I'll tell a story on my, on our current president a little bit.  He sends out a weekly email every Friday, just updating the entire organization on kind  
**[0:45:38-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:45:38):**  of where organization is moving.  And he left us last Friday with a thought at the end of his email.  And he, it was, I can't remember who, who he quoted.  
**[0:45:49-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:45:49):**  And so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll just say, I don't remember, but the gist of it was if  you haven't messed up something in the last six months, you're not trying hard enough.  And so the point is get out there and, you know, try to do a good job, try to do new  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:46:07):**  things, try to experiment and do new things.  But if you mess up, that means you're trying.  Yeah.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:46:14):**  You got to get away from this fear of never failing.  It's it's tough.  And I think a lot of producers have got themselves into a trap where they feel like they have  
**[0:46:27-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:46:27):**  to keep doing what they're doing because you know, they're locked into loans and programs  and insurance and you know, the safety net has become a hammock and well, they know that  that's going to work.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:46:40):**  They just kind of have to hope for that one good year out of seven when they have good  weather and nobody else does and they can sell a good crop at a good price.  That doesn't seem like it's a very healthy way to live to me.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:46:54):**  Yeah.  And that goes to this whole concept around conservation finance and, and you know, I  don't want to point out, you know, I worked for NRCS for a long time and it's a great  
**[0:47:10-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:47:10):**  organization and they've done a lot of good helping producers get conservation on the  ground.  But maybe I shouldn't go here, but I really think they, a lot of it, a lot of those employees  
**[0:47:23-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:47:23):**  feel the same ways.  You know, I just think those, those opportunities would be better utilized if we stopped paying  practice paying for practices and start, started paying for outcomes.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:47:36):**  Yeah, I love that.  We've we've we've gone down this road for for many, many years with the farm bill of  of paying producers to implement practices.  
**[0:47:47-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:47:47):**  I know, I know producers that have been paid to bulldoze the same brush three times over  a period of 30 years.  So I don't think they learned why that brush was there.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:48:01):**  They just knew they can get it paid for next time it came back.  So this idea of for us to enable them to be able to pay producers for the outcomes and  whether that outcome is some ecosystem service or or whatever the conservation outcome is  
**[0:48:19-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:48:19):**  they define, we've got to have better tools to be able to measure it.  And that's where I think that's probably one of the reasons they haven't done that is we  don't have good enough tools yet.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:48:29):**  No, we talked about soil organic matter, soil again, and you know, or carbon, we can't measure  it for every five years, you know, because of the changes slow over time.  That doesn't mean it isn't changing every day.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:48:44):**  Exactly.  Every day, we just don't have the ability to measure that change across the with some  level of uncertainty that's that's that we can deal with and the spatial variability  
**[0:48:58-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:48:58):**  across the landscape.  We just need better tools to be able to find that.  What would some of those tools look like?  
**[0:49:07-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:49:07):**  You know, I think as we move forward, we're going to have to be able to utilize more tools  like remote sensing.  I think I think we need to do our work, though, to build the build the models and the correlations  
**[0:49:23-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:49:23):**  back to the things that we're actually measuring.  I think there's some interesting work right now looking at carbon flux, CO2 gas flux and  understanding the entirety of the carbon that's being taken out of the system being sequestered  
**[0:49:41-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:49:41):**  in the ground and then how much is coming back up through through photosynthesis into  the plant material.  I mean, understanding that full lifecycle of carbon and from the in all three forms,  
**[0:49:55-0:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:49:55):**  right, is, I think, going to be pretty important for us to to understand.  But tying those correlations or inferences back to some level of remote sensing is really,  I think, I think how we're going to be able to scale some of this.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:50:13):**  We need to have better models and our bot models need to be parameterized with data  that's that's local.  I think ultimately, you know, you us three in a shovel aren't going to scale any kind  
**[0:50:29-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:50:29):**  of a monitoring program.  We need to use technology to understand ecology, not drive ecology.  Exactly right.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:50:42):**  And part of the you know, I just wanted to kind of explore that rabbit trail a little  bit because I'm trying to wrap my head around the monitoring problem.  You know, 750 million acres is a lot of country to cover.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:50:58):**  And you know, if people aren't involved in agriculture, they don't really have that good  of a concept of what one acre or 100 acres is much less 750 million.  You know, there aren't enough people to take manual soil samples to measure carbon on 750  
**[0:51:15-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:51:15):**  million acres a year like that, that labor just doesn't exist.  Like we'd have to birth a couple more couple more generations before we can get there.  So it's almost like we have to have people on the ground boots on the ground doing the  
**[0:51:29-0:51:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:51:29):**  work for years and years and years to develop the model that we could build the ground truth  off of to say this works here.  And then you can start incorporating your remote sensing data into that and see what  
**[0:51:41-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:51:41):**  else is working.  Is that is that kind of what I'm getting?  How did we do the NRCS's ecological site data?  
**[0:51:51-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:51:51):**  How did they get all that information?  Boots on the ground.  I mean, there's 600 plus people that work in NRCS just in Texas.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:52:00):**  And so it was built based off of the initial soil survey.  That soil survey took 50 years to and some of the some soils haven't even been finalized.  When I do areas of interest, I'm like, there's nothing there.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:52:15):**  Yeah.  And so it was a it was a long, expensive effort to survey all the soils in the US.  And then that was then a foundation then that you can build on to build what we used to  
**[0:52:29-0:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:52:29):**  call range sites into ecological sites, which are groups of soils that that act similarly  and respond similarly to management.  They're in the same hydrologic sort of position with terrain and such.  
**[0:52:42-0:53:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:52:42):**  And so once we you know, those those ecological sites that NRCS developed are an exceptional  planning tool for producers to begin to understand what the capabilities of those soils are.  The trouble I find with with you that tool is that it tells you what the capability is,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:53:01):**  that oftentimes I'll see producers want to use that tool to set a grazing plan.  I know.  It's a good starting point, but it has to tell you anything about the historical.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:53:13):**  You should compare it against what you're actually doing.  Yes.  It takes you on in the pasture to determine actually how much forage you have until we  
**[0:53:23-0:53:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:53:23):**  get better models.  But there's there's good models out there.  The NDC is a good model for looking at some of these ecological outputs.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:53:34):**  You know, there's some there's Dr. Keith Postion at Colorado State's working on some really  good models.  The MIMS model that Francesca Cutrufo is working with is really, I think, going to be a good  
**[0:53:50-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:53:50):**  direction for us as far as carbon and organic matter.  So there's a lot of really smart people working on working on that sort of direction and trying  to find solutions for us because they know that you're right, Brian, there aren't enough  
**[0:54:07-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:07):**  people to take enough soil probe samples out there to get enough samples to address the  variability across the landscape.  It's just achievable.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:20):**  Another awkward pause to edit out.  It just flushes out the right algorithm thing or whatever.  I'll go in and take that one out manually.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:37):**  So Jeff, you want to talk about fake meat?  Mm hmm.  That wasn't like yum.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:45):**  It was I'm not sure I'm your guy, but sure.  Have you tried one?  I have not.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:52):**  I refuse.  Why?  It makes me sick.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:54:56):**  I'm worried.  You know, if I want to eat something that tastes like meat, I'm going to eat meat.  And I just, you know, you look at the list of ingredients on that thing and it just doesn't  
**[0:55:11-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:55:11):**  appeal to me.  And, you know, I see I see beef and livestock as a positive contributor to ecological health.  And so it goes against my my I guess my constitution of of what's going to get us down the road.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:55:31):**  And it's just my personal opinion.  That's perfect.  I I've I've looked at the ingredient list and it frightens me.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:55:41):**  I'm not I don't I don't want to put that in my body.  No, no, me neither.  And, you know, I think we have I think this all stems from us as an industry not being  
**[0:55:55-0:56:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:55:55):**  able to tell our story well enough because we've apparently not done a good enough job  that individuals in maybe I could say maybe maybe more urban environment don't know what  the benefits are of having lines livestock on the landscape.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:56:13):**  And I mean, for one, they're consuming a product that we can't eat.  And so they're on a landscape that we can't really utilize.  And you know, it goes back to this bigger story of of when you look at even our even  
**[0:56:33-0:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:56:33):**  our crop production, most of our crop production is going to things other than food, you know,  ethanol and livestock feed and other things.  And I think we need to move more move back toward we're grazing more animals and feeding  
**[0:56:52-0:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:56:52):**  less.  So how can we get there?  Well, I think I think again, we've got to have we've got to have data.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:57:02):**  We've got to have an infrastructure that that that benefits that, you know, people look  at the grass fed movement or industry and think, well, that's a niche market, is it?  It's not for that each individual producer that's doing it.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:57:17):**  I mean, of course, it Yes, it makes up a smaller contingent of the beef industry in the US.  But what I what I find and I said feed less, I probably shouldn't have said that I think  there's still an opportunity for that in the in the in the in the beef industry.

I don't think feedlot corn finished beef is going to go away within our lifetimes.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:57:45):**  Like like we're not saying that at all.  No, that's not my point at all.  My point is, let's stop arguing amongst each other within the exactly.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:57:55):**  That's where that's where we we tend to go.  And, you know, it's like grass fed against feedlots.  And then it's the cow calf guy versus the stocker guy.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:58:05):**  And let's stop doing that.  And all look at ways that within our own sector of the industry, how can we get better?  How can we provide positive ecological, economic and social changes within the sector that  
**[0:58:23-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:58:23):**  we operate?  That's the question I want to ask and answer.  It's a it's a great question.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:58:31):**  And I think some of that answer is in how do we better tell our story?  How can regenerative producers better connect with the consumers and and the public to tell  our story of land regeneration and carbon sequestration and good quality nutrient dense  
**[0:58:51-0:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:58:51):**  meat?  I think we've got to we're fighting against a and that the opposition starts pretty young,  right?  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:05):**  They're in the schools.  Oh, yeah.  They're in the grade schools.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:08):**  They're you know, you you I don't know that we're telling that story to educating our  young like, like some of the other angles are.  And so youth education, I think is pretty critical, because if we want to transform  
**[0:59:25-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:25):**  the next generation, we got to start where they are.  And they're in they're in fifth grade right now.  And and so that's one thing youth education.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:34):**  You know, we've been doing adult education for a long time.  And we we make some changes.  I think we've made an impact.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:42):**  I think this movement is getting bigger.  I don't think it's going away anytime soon.  I think it's only going to get bigger and better.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:50):**  I think social media has helped.  Because now people have information at their fingertips anytime of the day.  Sometimes that's great.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=0:59:59):**  Sometimes that's a train wreck.  Keep our ears dumpster fires everywhere.  Exactly.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:00:07):**  But I mean, education is is is part of it.  But we we've got to provide opportunities for producers to see themselves as part of  the solution and in that in that opportunity.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:00:21):**  So they see, they see themselves as as moving in that direction.  And again, those quick wins we were talking about.  The the economics is a big driver for them.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:00:33):**  You know, the risk is driven largely a lot of times by the economics.  And if we're telling someone to sell all their equipment and do something different, we better  have some pretty darn good data or good neighbors to show them.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:00:49):**  Look, this is the way it works for them.  It could work in a similar fashion for you, maybe a little different.  But try to the smaller scale and then move up.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:00:59):**  It's the mindset.  If you have the mindset or not.  And it's building that capacity to to understand the ecology that's that's happening, the economics  
**[1:01:11-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:01:11):**  and putting all of that into this industry we call ranching.  It's a it is definitely a business.  And a lot of times we I mean, we look at ranching as a as a lifestyle.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:01:24):**  We look at ranching as a some people look at it as a hobby.  It is a absolute we have millions, 750 million small businesses out there.  That's exactly what they are.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:01:35):**  And they need to look at it from a business perspective.  I couldn't agree more.  So what are how can people find you on social media or on the Internet and and how can they  
**[1:01:51-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:01:51):**  reach Nobel Research Institute to maybe contact a specialist like yourself and and get some  help starting down a more regenerative path than the one they're on?  Yeah, I mean, I'm Nobel underscore land stewardship on Instagram.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:02:09):**  And more specifically, if you want to just get in contact with Nobel, I mean, we're in  a number of places in social media.  You can go to our website, Nobel dot org and find pretty much any information that you  
**[1:02:22-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:02:22):**  want to find out about us, our direction moving forward and regenerative ranching and and  and what are some of the you know, what are some of the focal areas that we're going to  be working on?  
**[1:02:34-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:02:34):**  I mean, we're going to be doing a number of we're going to be focusing on a number of  producer focused research questions moving forward in the areas of metrics management  monitoring, research around what is the transition to regenerate from conventional to traditional  
**[1:02:50-1:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:02:50):**  or to regenerative look like for a producer research around silvopasture and pecan systems,  research around wildlife ecology and its place in regenerative systems.  And then, like from the perspective of livestock adaptability, having the right animals in  
**[1:03:10-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:03:10):**  the right environment, those are some sort of key buckets of areas of focus for us.  But ultimately, the research question has got to provide a solution that to a question  of producers asking, so we're going to be working through and with producers along this  
**[1:03:27-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:03:27):**  way.  The last thing we want to do is be answering a bunch of questions no one's asking.  So that's our focus. It's going to have producer outcomes, and we're probably not going to  
**[1:03:37-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:03:37):**  be doing it.  Well, if you're answering the questions that nobody was asking, you'd be working for the  government.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:03:43):**  I didn't say that.  Oh, I did.  Well, is that have we left anything on the tables or something? Anything you'd like to  
**[1:03:56-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:03:56):**  get off your chest or ask myself or CK today?  Oh, I mean, we could do this all day. I mean, it's just like a just like a normal conversation  on a Saturday afternoon.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:04:07):**  But you know, I think we covered a lot of the main points that that, you know, I think  I want people to understand that that Nobles making a move and and and we're moving into  this space and with both feet, and we want to help producers and want people to reach  
**[1:04:27-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:04:27):**  out to us.  And I'm just thankful that you guys are doing what you're doing and and providing an outlet  for producers to tell their story. And, and I really like this idea of helping young producers

**[1:05:05-1:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/13--Jeff-Goodwin-Roots-in-the-Ground-Year-Round-e110rc4#t=1:05:05):**  So I'll see. Okay. Do you have anything else on your mind?

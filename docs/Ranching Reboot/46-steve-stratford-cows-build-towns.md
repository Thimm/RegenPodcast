**[0:00:59-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:00:59):**  I think everybody will really appreciate Steve's perspective on the cattle market and the cattle  business and what we can all do to start fixing some of the problems that we're having.  Alright, you ready?  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:11):**  Yep.  Well, Steve, thanks for being here.  Thanks for doing this.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:15):**  I've been wanting to meet up with you and get something done for a long time.  Long lines of a podcast or interview and I'm glad we finally got a chance to sit down and  do it.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:24):**  We're here again and Pratt at the Eastus Media Studio and I'm glad we're doing this face  to face and I'm really glad we are because I don't think that you and I would have near  the same interaction we'd have on Zoom.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:33):**  So thanks for being here.  Steve Stratford.  You bet.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:37):**  Thank you, Brian.  That's probably why we're behind the eight ball in the battle that we're all trying to  fight anyways, that we're all too busy to make time happen.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:46):**  I've wanted to be here before now and there's always work in the way.  So anyway, glad we made it happen tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:01:55):**  If you want to go ahead and lean back, just make sure that mic is a little bit close.  Get comfortable.  It's a fancy place.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:02):**  Yeah, it is.  It's really nice.  I appreciate Cody letting me use it.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:06):**  Let's start off and let's tell the listeners a little bit about Steve Stratford and what  you do these days, Steve.  Oh, there's not a lot glorious about what I do, Brian.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:18):**  We sell a couple of Hunter bulls to probably the 100 mile radius, basically.  Some go outside of that, but to a lot of the local ranchers around here have for a long  time now, I don't know, 10, 15 years.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:30):**  And that's Stratford Angus.  And since 15, 16 years old, I've, I've ordered a bought cattle.  Of course that probably progressively has got bigger.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:42):**  But as of today, you know, I purchase probably 50 to 70,000 cattle a year for, for feed yards.  On corporate feed yards, I might add.  And that's what the barn here in Pratt livestock.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:02:57):**  Now that's kind of separate from the barn.  I mean, my order buying separate.  And then I come on to assist the Lewis's in running Pratt livestock for the winter family.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:03:12):**  So kind of do a lot of the jobs nobody else wants to do there.  But I do get the pleasure on Tuesday, Wednesday of sorting off a lot of the cattle that we  have.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:03:23):**  You know, yard manager, Roger Ponic does that also, but we're busy like today sorting the  sorting the cattle.  So I get to be on the ground with 150 to 70,000 cattle a year that we market through there.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:03:37):**  And you know, it's, it's a fun job.  You know, I love it and I've loved it for a long time.  I just like to like to see the people that we work for stay in business.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:03:50):**  There's no doubt like, and I think that no matter what side of the regenerative or conventional  fence anybody's on, like there's no argument about it.  Our rural communities are dying.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:00):**  And one of the things that that you've said that I absolutely love is cows build towns.  And I think there's a lot of fundamental truth and we can we can definitely circle back to  that later.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:13):**  You kind of opened up by talking about, you know, some of the, some of the problems we're  facing and you know, I want to get the show out next week.  And have you seen, have you seen like the, the thing they did at the white house?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:26):**  I think that was yesterday.  It was like almost two hours.  They put a little, I watched about 30 minutes of it on YouTube, but they're, the Biden Harris  
**[0:04:34-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:34):**  administration is talking about what they're going to try to do to read, to address the  situation that we're facing with the meat packers and consolidation.  And not just in, not just as beef producers.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:44):**  I mean, they're talking about helping the chicken and the pork guys out too.  Are you familiar with any of that?  What do you think of what they said they want to do?  
**[0:04:52-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:04:52):**  Like, is there anything legislatively in the pipeline that you know of that could actually  bring some relief?  I mean, they're talking about strengthening the Packers and Stockyards Act or trying to  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:02):**  blame previous administrations for weakening it.  It's like, we don't need to act.  I don't think we need to strengthen any laws on the books.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:09):**  I think we just actually need to start enforcing them.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  The laws are there.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:14):**  And a hundred years ago, we knew exactly that what's going on today didn't need to happen.  It would adversely affect our, our ag producers and the consumer.  And here we are.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:29):**  That frustrates me as much as anything.  You know, when, when those laws, and I think 1921 of them, if I'm correct, were put in,  there was five or six of the major Packers at the time.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:44):**  I think it was five.  I think, I think I saw it was five.  And it was like 55% is what they controlled.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:50):**  And we knew that was too much for the consumer and for the rancher and, and initiated those  laws.  Well, today you've got four with 85%.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:05:59):**  So it shows you what a piss poor job they've done at enforcing that law.  And it's not because the P and S is understaffed or they don't like going around forcing laws.  For instance, in my order buying, you know, I have to file a yearly report with the P  
**[0:06:17-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:17):**  and S. If I'm 30 days late filing that report, they'll show up at the sale barns I work at  and cease and desist and shut you down.  Really?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:26):**  If you don't fill out the paperwork.  What's that paperwork?  I'm not familiar with that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:31):**  Oh, it's the, the, the foundation of the paperwork is to require an order buyer to be bonded.  Okay.  So under P and S rules, if I buy cattle for anybody but myself, I have to be bonded.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:43):**  And that's for financial responsibility and liability, right?  But any sale barn in the country will tell you that those bonds ain't worth the paper  they're written on.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:51):**  They're just an insurance policy and they're going to do everything they can not to pay  it.  So on and so forth.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:06:56):**  And if a big order buyer tips over, they're never bonded for enough of what they tip over.  But that's beside the point.  But the P and S report for me is basically you, the total head count per quarter and  
**[0:07:09-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:07:09):**  the total dollars per quarter.  And then you have to be bonded for your highest quarter.  And so you send in that report and they tell you if you've got to raise your bond or not  
**[0:07:19-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:07:19):**  for the year.  Can you scoot just a little bit closer to the mic?  But anyway, they enforce that wholeheartedly and they have a big staff enforcing that.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:07:29):**  To the point of if we have a guy wander in and he's buying 25, 30 kids for his neighbor  when the P and S comes into a sale barn, ask for a run out of anybody that got paid commission.  If those people charge a commission on 20 head, they'll be sending them a letter and  
**[0:07:45-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:07:45):**  breathing down their throat, you know, for a total dollars a commission of maybe a thousand  for a year.  Yeah, that's kind of like they're trying to scoop up peanuts.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:07:55):**  Yeah.  And they won't enforce the laws against the packers colluding and owning livestock and  so on and so forth.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:08:07):**  So it's obvious that the corporate power and the corporate money has got them to ignore  those laws.  It's not lack of staffing, lack of interest.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:08:16):**  You know, they get in all of our business.  So they've just tried to avoid the laws of the packers.  And I'm sure they probably get some special carve outs and provisions in those laws that,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:08:27):**  you know, some of that stuff applies to little guys like you and me, but doesn't apply if  you're over this kind of a scale.  It's disturbing that things like that happen.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:08:38):**  And those are the kind of things that happen.  Like, you know, some of these some of these agreements that we need to talk about, like  alternative marketing agreements, these backroom deals that are a handshake and probably not  
**[0:08:52-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:08:52):**  even written down.  Like I guess that's something I want to get into is they're talking about having to report  all of these alternative marketing agreements, the alternative marketing agreement reporting  
**[0:09:03-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:09:03):**  system.  How many of those you think are actually written down?  Because I think you and I both know that we can get a lot of business done with a handshake  
**[0:09:11-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:09:11):**  over the hood of a pickup and there's no paper chain hands and we can do million dollars  worth of cattle business on a handshake.  There's no doubt that some of them are that way, Brian.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:09:22):**  But you know, if they've got to report how they sell their cattle and the total revenue  for those cattle, including end of the year kickbacks or per head count bonuses, so on  and so forth, then the way I understand that those should all be included, whether it's  
**[0:09:38-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:09:38):**  a written contract or not.  And more on the contract point, if you look at the P&S rules, it's illegal for the packers  to own cattle.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:09:50):**  And they obviously have failed to enforce that and the loopholes that allow them to.  But even these AMAs, I mean, take for instance, if I came down to Ted and Brian Alexander's  and I contracted your cattle in April for October delivery, we could scratch it out  
**[0:10:08-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:08):**  on that notepad and if I fail to show up, you have a case in court and you'll probably  win in this area.  The courts favor ag and that's the way it's been done for years.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:22):**  And they understand ag.  And so basically in April when I price those cattle or tell you I'm going to come get them  in October, I own them.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, I haven't paid for them yet and I haven't took delivery, but I own them.  But that's a commitment, right?  And the packers have those agreements all over and so I do not understand how and why  
**[0:10:39-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:39):**  we can't enforce that as packer ownership.  And it seems like they can get out of their side of the deal if they want to.  Like they can contract with the feed yard like, oh, we'll take October delivery on these  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:50):**  10 pens and October comes and they're like, oh, well, we only need two because this plant  screwed up.  Sorry, we're not going to pay you.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:10:56):**  And there's no recourse for the feedlot.  And they don't do that to the big guys with the special deals and stuff.  They do that to the farmer feeders in Nebraska and Iowa.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:05):**  That's why there aren't any left.  When COVID hit, you heard story after story of that, you know, making them overfeed them  30, 45 days while they kept their buddies current, which allowed their buddies to come  
**[0:11:16-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:16):**  buy feeder cattle without those farmer feeders in the market competing against them.  You know, shit runs downhill.  You know, it hurt people in two or three different folds.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:29):**  It only really takes one guy.  One other guy sitting in the stands and that sale barn to make a huge difference in the  sale price on that day.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:35):**  Doesn't it?  Oh, you know, I've told many people, but, uh, you know, you reverse back to the mid  nineties.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:43):**  Um, you know, we had three times the active feeder buyers as we do today.  Um, a lot of individuals, a lot of those baby boomer age guys that have either either died  or quit, went broke.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:11:55):**  Um, but if the corporations got full or they walked out, um, or, uh, you know, the board  reacted that adversely that day that everybody watches, there was an individual there to,  to pick up the slack within a dollar or two, you know, of what the corporations would give.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:12:15):**  Um, in today's world, um, it's so shallow.  If one of the two of the biggest purchasers that day would fill up or stop, um, the market  can drop five to $8 or a hundred on a classic cattle with one guy falling out.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:12:30):**  And that's too much power for any guy to have.  And I'm sitting here and, and, and today may not be the case five years from now, but I'm  one of those guys.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:12:38):**  Um, you know, there's five or six of us in there that if you went, if you just got up  and packed up and left the market could be, you know, quite a bit lower, not all weeks,  but certain weeks.  
**[0:12:50-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:12:50):**  Um, and there's no reason for, for it to be that, that tight knit and anybody to have  that much power.  My, uh, my friend that used to live west of me down the river, I think, you know who I'm  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:01):**  talking about.  I don't, I don't want to mention any names, but, uh, he, he's left the area.  He uh, I used to go to the sale barn down in Woodward with him quite often.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:10):**  And there was several times like late in the day, he'd have all his orders filled, but  there'd be a draft of cattle.  He'd start bidding on it.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:17):**  I'd be like, dude, what are you doing?  And he's like, I am not going to let this guy have that pen of cattle that fricking  cheap.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:22):**  It's too cheap.  We got to keep prices up.  I said, what happens if you get stuck with them?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:26):**  He said, well, every once in a while it happens.  I get stabbed with an extra load that I don't need, but I'll find a way to make money on  them.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:32):**  Okay.  Fair enough.  So it just takes one guy.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:37):**  Sometimes it just takes one guy to run that, you know, run up four or five bucks.  Second place is the most important spot in an auction.  You know, obviously first place came to give whatever they give or more.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:47):**  We don't know.  You know, but second place pushed them to that amount.  So you know, everybody wants to get up and thank the guy that bought them and that's  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:13:57):**  great, but it takes second place to put him there.  I like that thought.  That's a good thought.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:14:04):**  And it probably comes from a lot of years of seeing the inside of a lot of sale barns.  So tell me a little bit more about the story of Stratford Angus.  How did you get in the bull breeding business?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:14:14):**  How did you get in the seed stock business?  You know, that probably started by kind of order buying bulls for people, just a lot  of good friends and so on and so forth, I guess started asking me to purchase bulls  
**[0:14:28-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:14:28):**  for them at other places.  We'd always ran a cow herd, so on and so forth.  So I guess I just started breeding and procuring those bulls for my customers, you know, direct.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:14:44):**  And it, you know, it's not the breeding and raising the bulls.  It's enjoyable.  It's the seeing the progeny and seeing the result when they come back in the auction.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:14:57):**  I don't think if I was a standalone, just seed stock supplier, I would enjoy it as much  as I am where I'm at the sale barn and order buying because you get to firsthand see them  come back.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:15:08):**  I can imagine that's pretty rewarding.  There's other seed stock guys that do that, most in the northwest, but very few in this  immediate area, you know, get their hands on them again and again and then get the feedback  
**[0:15:24-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:15:24):**  from the feeder end.  That's probably why losing some of those iwegion farmer feeders that I'm so passionate about  trying to keep in business is because those guys would buy those one, two lot deals of  
**[0:15:37-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:15:37):**  home raised steers, keep them separate and get the harvest data on them.  You got a lot of feedback from those type of guys to where the big feed yards co-mingle  them with cattle from other barns.  
**[0:15:50-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:15:50):**  There's a lot less traceability.  So that the whole chain makes supplying the bulls fun.  And again, it goes back to the people.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:16:04):**  I mean, for the most part, you know, I get five, six, seven, eight new customers a year.  I don't have a handful die or, you know, quit so on and so forth.  But the core are people I've dealt with for 30 years now, you know, and starting to deal  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:16:22):**  with the second and in some cases the third generation that people I've dealt with.  And that's neat.  That is neat.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:16:29):**  That is really neat.  So what, like what type of bulls do you raise?  What's your, what's your, what are you looking for phenotypically?  
**[0:16:39-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:16:39):**  You know, we want a bull that's, that's pleasing to the eye.  We probably don't do that to the, to the degree of some more of the show calf type cattle.  Because we would err to performance conversion and carcass also.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:17:02):**  Yet, we live in South Central Kansas.  So so you've got to keep downward pressure on milk.  And we're probably to the threshold now that we're starting to make these females for this  
**[0:17:13-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:17:13):**  country too big.  So the last year or two, we've probably started capping that growth.  You know, we've got just too much power in these cattle now.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:17:23):**  How big is too big on the cow?  You know, that varies.  You know, your management versus my neighbors management's, you know, two totally different  
**[0:17:33-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:17:33):**  things and their resources are different.  So that varies.  In this area, I would say 90% of people probably need a cow that weighs 11 and a half to 14.  
**[0:17:51-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:17:51):**  You get any bigger than that, which we are on some of these cows, it's too big for this  country.  You know, and I think I think maybe on the lower end, like a lot of mine are 600.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:18:04):**  But we're trying to breed that up.  And I think I'm trying to shoot for about a 900 to 1000 pound cow.  But I'm on a lot hillier ground and you're probably familiar with up here in Pratt County.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:18:15):**  And I think I need a lighter cow to be able to travel up and down the hills and be able  to cross all my, you know, bogs and swamp lands efficiently.  As long as we can get the gut capacity and keep, you know, a decent frame size.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:18:27):**  Yeah.  And then you've got to have that performance at the next level.  And that's what the catch 22 is.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:18:36):**  I think these cows have got too big to be profitable for the rancher if you take into  consideration the feed requirements and the breed back, longevity of the cow.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:47-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:18:47):**  So, if we were getting as a rancher, if you were getting your share of the retail dollar,  then that added performance that you're supplying the industry.  If you were getting what you deserved out of that product would counteract a lot of  
**[0:19:06-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:19:06):**  the ills of that bigger cow.  The way we are now working on a smaller margin than we were in 1975 as a cow calf producer,  we're basically programming and breeding these animals for the packer.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:19:22):**  And so all the ill effects of that performance and that size of that cow is falling at the  rancher's expense.  Because the bigger cow and the bigger carcass per animal makes the packer more money than  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:19:34):**  a smaller animal.  Correct.  And you and I have had this discussion previously, a smaller animal is more profitable for the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:19:41):**  rancher but it just might not bring a whole lot of the sale barn or for the packer which  is why they don't sell well at the sale barn.  And everything's so performance based.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:19:51):**  These western Kansas feedlots, I mean they're all on monthly comparison data between the  feed yards of conversion and gain, all the feed additives and the implants and just everybody's  grade card is off performance.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:20:10):**  And like I say, that's fine.  If we were selling $1500 calves, you can take an extra 5% 10% open cows.  You can turn your cow herd over every six years instead of every 10.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:20:30):**  There's a lot of things that increased market share would allow you to do and supply what  the packer and the feed yards are wanting.  The way it is now, like I say, all that cost is falling on the rancher.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:20:44):**  They're going out and giving the $5000 to $7000 for those bulls that are designed for  the packing industry, not designed for Barbara County ranches.  Right.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:20:55):**  Right.  And after a year or two out in the grasslands of the red hills, they look a little bit rough.  And trust me, I mean, what's very unique is that I get to breed bulls, I purchase feeder  
**[0:21:11-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:21:11):**  cattle for feed yards.  I get a lot of feedback on the harvest data.  A couple things you probably don't know, but I have very good friends in smaller scale  
**[0:21:23-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:21:23):**  packing, not corporate packing.  A lot of friends in the meat business.  My brother-in-law has Colorado premium beef, is for the processor.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:21:33):**  Didn't know that.  So, it's very unique.  I get to see the entire chain and get feedback from the entire chain.  
**[0:21:44-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:21:44):**  Most people are specialists in one field.  I'm a specialist in nothing, but I get a lot of information from everywhere down the line.  You've got a great perspective on the entire beef industry, soup to nuts, seed stock production  
**[0:22:00-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:00):**  from the farmer feeder and cow calf guy, all the way to craft meat and commodity beef through  the feedlot.  And I'm assuming you have some experience with pasture finished, forage finished beef,  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:11):**  or is that something you haven't been into yet?  Not as much in some, but some.  And like my brother-in-law with Colorado premium, in other countries, they could sell all the  
**[0:22:21-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:21):**  grass finished beef that you can get your hands on is what he tells me.  And it's a growing market in Australia and in other parts of the country.  Do you see it growing here?  
**[0:22:33-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:33):**  You know, A, he does.  B, I'm sensing you don't agree.  I think it is probably a growing market for the millennial that we'll be feeding that  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:50):**  replaces the baby boomer that's dying.  I agree.  100%.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:22:54):**  You know, well, right now, while the baby boomers are still alive and are filling all  the restaurants and have all the equity and they're still the major beef consumers, it's  business as usual.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:23:08):**  I mean, they're going to sit down and eat that 16 ounce steak and they don't care what  you fed it and what you did to it or what any doctor or report says about it.  And they don't want that warm, fuzzy story about where it came from.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:23:25):**  They don't care that you called it peaches for five years.  Now the new generation that will be the lead consumers and will be the older consumer in  another decade and the one that goes to the grocery store and is doing the shopping for  
**[0:23:40-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:23:40):**  their family, it's a whole different beast.  You know, they do want a story and they'll pay for a story.  They do want to know more of a source and where it came from and how it was fed.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:23:56):**  They probably don't get as much enjoyment out of a prime steak that was grain finished  like I do.  They'd rather have a half a portion that probably costs just as much and know exactly everything  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:24:11):**  about it the whole way down the scale.  And that's what we've all got to adjust to.  How prevalent that'll be, what kind of a market driver that'll be.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:24:20):**  But I think it is an involving market.  Okay.  Have you started to maybe select symbols for Forage Performance?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:24:28):**  You know, personally, no.  I don't have anybody right off hand that is doing that.  And quite honestly, I would not sell a bull that does not require more energy than that.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:24:43):**  Okay.  I mean, you won't like that.  I liken it to, and this is one thing that we don't do a great job of educating bull  
**[0:24:52-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:24:52):**  buyers on.  Some people come give a lot of money for the most high powered, high growth bull that you've  got.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:25:04):**  But then they feed like they've got a 900 pound cow, like you're going to run.  And so their progeny is probably smaller than it was 20 years ago.  And I liken that the easiest way to explain that to somebody that I've found that they  
**[0:25:18-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:25:18):**  can grasp is your 300 horsepower diesel motor getting all the fuel it needs runs a lot better  than a 700 horsepower diesel motor on half the fuel it needs.  That's a good analogy.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:25:34):**  That's a good analogy.  And it seems to be the easiest way to get people to, you know, you need to choose your  bulls for your resources.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:25:45):**  Now there's also a flip side to that.  Like this time of year, lighter kettle head dollar wise, we'll get awfully close to a  bigger one.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:25:56):**  People taking them to grass to the August feeder board.  And even though you didn't get those pounds out of that kettle, that performance is genetically  there.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:05):**  Right.  And so the guy that takes them to forage and they do have all they want next summer, come  off grass, go to feed, they're aged, that performance shows up and that guy's there  
**[0:26:15-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:15):**  next year to give too much.  I have a really good friend that happens to be a neighbor and probably a leaser of yours.  And that's kind of the model he runs.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah.  Well, I know exactly who you're talking about.  We don't need to mention his name, but we are great friends and I know he's used your  
**[0:26:34-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:34):**  bulls for at least 10 years.  I mean, yeah, probably 20.  And yeah, and it's really neat having him as a neighbor because did you know that our  
**[0:26:44-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:44):**  fathers ran cattle together out there on all that property together back in the nineties?  Yeah, I did.  I was buying cattle for his dad in the nineties.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:53):**  It's a small world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  My friend's calves, like he blew the doors off the barn.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:27:02):**  Like that was, I was proud of him for that.  That was, that was, that was amazing.  So what you're talking about, like educating a bull buyer.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:27:12):**  And one of the questions I have written down over here is what, like who should buy bulls  from you and what are some things that you want to tell a bull buyer?  You know, my job's to assist the bull buyer and I have so many people with various resources,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:27:35):**  various different management.  That's my job as a seed stock supplier when he comes and asks for advice or, or ask about  the bulls or the sire groups of what fits him the best.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:27:50):**  That's where another good friend, he's not going to mind me saying his name, but Chris  Earl is also a cattle breeder and seed stock supplier.  And we come to, we come to a disagreement with the Angus Association.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:28:08):**  Their idea of educating a bull buyer is educating him on what the packer wants.  Okay.  And I'll be the first, it's kind of like the checkoff, you know, in the eighties and nineties  
**[0:28:22-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:28:22):**  beef was in trouble.  Oh yeah.  And we needed to check off and we needed advertising the beef and we needed to change our product.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:28:33):**  We've done that.  And the turnover in a commercial cow herd is so slow that, you know, it's 10 years behind  me.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:28:42):**  Right.  With embryo transfer and you know, and the age of a commercial cow herds cow.  So fast forward 10 years from now and see how big the cows are going to be, how poor  
**[0:28:52-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:28:52):**  the fertility is going to be in sub-arid places like we are.  I think, I think we're in for a wreck.  I think a lot of guys are in for a wreck.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:29:01):**  I mean, if you don't start fixing that today, you know, we've went too far.  So the Angus Association does a lot of amazing things and it's an amazing association with  great employees.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:29:19):**  And they've done a great job of elevating the Angus breed to, you know, the top of the  cattle business.  There's no doubt.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:29:28):**  But their desire to be a mega corporation or be at the table with the NCBAs and the  packers and feel included in the cattle industry has got them to where some of the information  is misguided for the average commercial producer, if that makes sense.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:29:51):**  I can see that.  You can't have a blanket approach.  It takes a different bull and a different seed stock supplier in Okeechobee, Florida  
**[0:29:58-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:29:58):**  than it does Pratt, Kansas and a different one in Pratt, Kansas than it does Bozeman,  Montana.  I've had a lot of people, just because like on any given Thursday, Pratt Livestock, it's  
**[0:30:16-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:30:16):**  probably why I enjoy doing what I do because for that little bit of time, I'm as educated  and in the know as anybody because I know the producers, I know the kill, I know what  day they came in.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:30:29):**  I know the past performance.  I know all the answers that anybody else could know.  There's still a lot of FUBUs in there that you can screw up, but I have as much information,  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:30:41):**  I guess, what I ought to say as anybody.  I go to Okeechobee, Florida.  I don't have that.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:30:49):**  I don't know those cattle.  I don't know the past history.  I don't know anything about them.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:30:53):**  You can't go look at a pen of cows and say, those cows fit this environment or those cows  will succeed here or feed well.  Those guys have done business there for 30 years.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:31:03):**  I mean, they could out trade me all day long.  That's the same thing in the seed stock business in the region you're in.  American Angus can't coach my bull buyer like I can.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:31:17):**  And I'm not saying I'm smarter than them, but I know their management.  I know how they deal with their cattle.  I know how they market their cattle.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:31:23):**  I know when they market their cattle.  I know how they feed.  And so, you know what the weather like in this area and what it takes to keep an animal  
**[0:31:31-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:31:31):**  alive here.  So I that's the service.  That's why they paid me for my bull is, you know, there's a lot of Angus bulls for sale.  
**[0:31:41-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:31:41):**  You know, you come by bulls from people, you know, not because they're an Angus bull.  And so I think that the individual breeder needs to be the one educating his clientele,  not a blanket education from the Angus Association on what JBS and Tyson want you to do.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:04):**  And I think that, you know, things like, you know, like some of the recommendations, you  know, their blanket things they put out and, you know, things like EPDs are because there's  a lot of people that don't have the time or the ability to understand everything.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:18):**  And they just need a simple, they just need it distilled down quickly to something very  simple that they can act on.  Like what's the best bull for my ranch?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:28):**  I'm sure you hear that question probably way more than you want to admit.  And it's like, you know, what are the best cows?  What kind of cows should I buy?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:38):**  Well, how the hell should I know?  I don't even know if you should own cows, but here's what I think.  Your cows need to fit your environment.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:45):**  You need to have bulls that will succeed on your forage base and grow to fit your goals.  And what breed is that?  I have no idea.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:51):**  And you probably don't either.  Nobody can answer this.  Like you can't answer these questions for everybody.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:32:57):**  Same exact environment need two different bulls.  Some people keep heifers every year and that female is going to have to work.  Some people, some of my biggest bull buyers, I purchase females for them.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:33:12):**  And so retaining heifers is not a concern.  So that opens up a whole different deal.  We don't have to worry about pedigree and we don't have to worry about maternal traits.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:33:23):**  We're just selling pounds of beef and performance.  That is a totally different advisory role than the guy that keeps 30, 40 heifers every  year and maintains his cow herd that way.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:33:38):**  So that bull is moving all the time and it's different.  Like I say, two people living right next to each other need a totally different bull.  Right.  
**[0:33:48-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:33:48):**  And sometimes that could just be a difference of two weeks of calving season or just a change  in feeding strategy or what somebody is looking for, trying to make those F1 crosses or trying  to make a commercial animal to go into the commercial system and don't care about raising  
**[0:34:02-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:34:02):**  their own replacements.  I think, and you can disagree with me if you want to.  No problem with that.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:34:11):**  I think the only way to get good cows is you either have to grow them yourself or you got  to buy the ranch they're standing on.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:34:17):**  I mean, that would go to being that your female needs to be adapted to your environment.  I mean, and that is very true.  Now the definition of a good cow.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:34:38):**  What is Steve Stratford's definition of a good cow?  You know, a good cow to me is one that's profitable for the guy running her.  I don't care if she raises a 400 pound calf or an 800 pound calf.  
**[0:34:49-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:34:49):**  I don't care if she weighs 950 or 1450.  If you can run that cow in your management scheme and your revenue offsets your expenses.  She's probably a good cow.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:35:03):**  She's a good cow.  And you know, some people can, you know, some people can raise the best cows in the world.  Some people can buy a cow and make her work.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:35:18):**  You know, it's a very diverse business.  Takes all kinds of folk to make the world go around.  Back to bulls.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:35:30):**  How would you, how does a person evaluate a bull without relying on EPDs?  What do you look for visually in a bull to tell you that he's going to perform well and  he's masculine and testosterone?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:35:44):**  Do you have any visual indicators that you learned from your time ordered by him?  You know, just structure.  I know you were, you were huge on feet and structure like five, six, seven years ago  
**[0:35:57-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:35:57):**  because I know, cause I saw him, there are a lot, there are a lot of cattle in the area  that had some serious structural problems with their legs and feet.  I know you're huge on that.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:36:07):**  I mean, you know, legs, feet, you know, you got to have some scrotal.  There's no doubt in the world that scrotal size is directly relative to fertility in  the daughters.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:36:19):**  And the ability for that bull to cover enough females.  You know, they can be mounting females and they don't have anything to shoot, so it doesn't  do any good.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:36:27):**  You know, everybody judges if the bull's working on, if he's mounting, well, he's got to produce  semen and have storage of semen to be able to cover those 30 cows that are in, you know,  in a two week period.  
**[0:36:39-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:36:39):**  And he's got to have the feet and the legs to get him around to do that.  In today's world, you would have to hunt pretty hard in this area to go buy a bull that just  flat off EPD performance is going to do you a disservice.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:37:03):**  You know, the one thing we've done is we've made these cattle awfully good, you know,  performance wise.  So at this point, you know, as long as the EPDs are acceptable, I think the biggest focus  
**[0:37:16-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:37:16):**  is keepability, feed and scrotal.  What should people not worry about when they're buying bulls?  What's crap in every bull catalog that people should just ignore?  
**[0:37:30-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:37:30):**  Is there anything?  I'd probably be cautious for you to tell you that there's stuff to just totally ignore.  I guess what would set off alarm bells if you saw in somebody else's catalog?  
**[0:37:51-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:37:51):**  Probably what is misunderstood in the general public is actual weaning weights and actual  yearling weights.  Okay.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:38:01):**  And a lot of people like to print those and a lot of people like to look at them and compare  them from one breeder to another.  And you really can't do that.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah, I can definitely see how that would lead to a train wreck.  Those actuals are in the EPD in the form of a ratio in your herd.  And so my bull that weighs 11.50 the year cannot be directly compared to a bull that  
**[0:38:30-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:38:30):**  is 8 or 30 miles from here yearling weight of 1400 because he's fed different.  So the DNA and your weaning yearling ratios are all in that EPD.  So comparing actuals is a real catch 22.  
**[0:38:51-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:38:51):**  Birth weight is also the same thing.  If that cow's eating out of a bunk and getting fed really good, she's going to have bigger  calves than that cow that's being treated like a real cow.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:39:02):**  So comparing a 65-pound birth weight at my place to an 80-pound birth weight somewhere  else or vice versa is a fallacy.  So in today's world, looking at those actuals…  
**[0:39:16-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:39:16):**  You think we chase birthing weights too low?  Yeah, oh yeah.  I think that's some of the problem.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:39:26):**  Everybody went through the continentals and that's what made Angus popular was fixing  all the dystocia.  And so we bred everything to be these curve benders, ultra low birth weight, yet all this  
**[0:39:40-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:39:40):**  performance.  That has come into problems in every breed that I happen to deal in Angus.  But we've kind of outthought mother nature there.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:39:53):**  Most of those extreme low birth weight cattle are shorter gestation.  They're born a little frailer.  And they're designed to weigh two, 300 pounds more than 20 years ago, 400 pounds more.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:40:11):**  And they're also designed to do that in a shorter period of time.  So they gain more.  What isn't different is their lungs aren't any bigger or stronger, hearted any bigger  
**[0:40:22-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:40:22):**  or stronger.  And if you throw adverse effects like humidity or heat or weather, they can't take it.  And their livers aren't any bigger.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:40:31):**  And we're feeding them.  They're using so much energy that you throw any other stressor out of there, something  gives.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:40:39):**  And we've got that, like I say, in Angus and so does every other breed.  But the deaths at the feed yard are called AIP.  And most of those, there's a lot smarter people than me working on it.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:40:55):**  But I think most of those are your cattle that are probably born lighter, did not have  the skeleton and structure to carry the performance that they're genetically have in them.  And if you trace a lot of those cattle back, it's cattle that never had a bad day.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:41:17):**  I mean, it's like having a kid that has always had what he wanted and then when he's 25,  couldn't figure out why he hadn't grown up.  And you know, you never-  
**[0:41:25-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:41:25):**  What do you mean I have to go get a job?  Those cattle that never had a stressor, their life's been perfect.  If everything goes right, they're the ones to put in the catalog and write an article  
**[0:41:39-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:41:39):**  about how well they perform.  But if something doesn't go right, they can't handle it.  And there's a little fallacy there, back to the seed stock.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:41:53):**  We make cattle survive that in a normal environment wouldn't have 30 years ago.  And then we're selling that to somebody else to replicate.  I mean, we go out and we bring them into a barn or we treat them special or, you know,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:42:08):**  we give them three doses of colostrum to keep them alive because we have so much invested  in them.  Well, 30 years ago, he'd have been frozen to the ground and wouldn't have been a bull  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:42:16):**  that you'd have selected.  Now, he may have all the right pieces EPD wise and performance wise, but he wouldn't  have survived.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:42:24):**  His mother didn't make him survive.  And if his mother couldn't raise him, is that really something that should be sold as a  bull to continue his genetic heritage?  
**[0:42:35-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:42:35):**  Correct.  And so we've started making seed stock's life too perfect.  A lot of places you'll see now and, you know, it seems like everybody that has a successful  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:42:53):**  business in some other realm, when they get to be mid-aged, decide they want to be John  Wayne and have a cow herd.  Seems like that, doesn't it?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:43:01):**  There's some kind of allure to the cowboy.  Is that why the average age in ranching keeps going up?  But these outfits build big, huge buildings and calving barns and it's a good animal husbandry  
**[0:43:18-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:43:18):**  tactic.  I mean, they do a great job and they treat the cattle great.  But where's the line between good husbandry and just absolutely pampering and babying  
**[0:43:30-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:43:30):**  the shit out of them to where they wouldn't be able to survive in the wild?  Yeah, exactly.  And so I think we're breeding some of the survivability out of them.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:43:39):**  You know, we got a lot better antibiotics and vaccines than we did 20, 30 years ago.  And in the fall, still to this day, you know, calf health's the biggest hurdle we all face  when you move them around.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:43:53):**  October is usually national dead calf month.  I know I'm not the only person that says that.  Yeah.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:44:00):**  So I think there's a lot of things that we need to focus on probably now.  I think the carcass and the performance is there.  We probably have went overboard for what most commercial operations can supply the energy  
**[0:44:14-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:44:14):**  for.  And so now we probably need to start taking a look at survivability, fertility and, you  know, quite honestly, cattle that don't fall suspect to BRD, BRSV, pink eye, things like  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:44:33):**  that.  I agree.  But I feel like the more that we can take away, the more cow calf producers like me  
**[0:44:42-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:44:42):**  that are willing to start taking away these supplements and these inputs and go to a lower  input and accept, you know, some lower fertility for some lower cost.  It's going to be painful to get through the hurdle of going from a higher input type operation  
**[0:44:58-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:44:58):**  to an input to a lower input and build back to where you were product wise.  Does that make sense?  So, what was I saying?  
**[0:45:07-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:07):**  What were we talking about?  Just breeding cattle to be tougher.  Right.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:16):**  You know, breeding the survivability back into them.  That's one of the things that really appealed to me about the Coriante breed.  So I don't think I've ever really discussed this and somebody sent me a picture of this  
**[0:45:26-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:26):**  and I'll kind of walk through it with you.  You've heard me talk about school called ranching for profit.  Well, it's seven days and one of the things you do in the last day and a half is you do  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:37):**  this exercise about nature's cow herd.  Okay.  And you don't talk about your ranch.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:43):**  You talk about your neighbor's ranch because you never talk about your ranch there.  You always talk about your neighbors because it's a lot easier to talk about the problems  on your neighbor's ranch and what he's doing wrong than admit what you're doing wrong.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:54):**  Right.  Okay.  So, you and I have ranches.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:45:59):**  We have identical looking operations today.  The only difference is I leave, I tear out all my fences.  I leave for 20 years and I come back.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:46:09):**  What do our cow herds look like?  Yours will probably look the same.  What is nature's cow herd going to look like?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:46:15):**  They're going to be a smaller frame animal.  Your fertility is going to be in the 80s.  You're going to have more of an even balance between, you know, between males and females.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:46:25):**  And if you could make one change to that nature's cow herd, like just one change, the change  you make is the bull to cow ratio and you make steers out of most of your bulls.  That's the one change you make and the improvements in the economics and the gross margin is unreal.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:46:45):**  Yeah.  Your profit is more in the exercise.  Your input costs are so low that the little bit less you get from the sales is totally  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:46:58):**  offset and you make more profit.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:02):**  So, I've always thought, the first time I went through that course, I was exposed to  that exercise was in 2006.  So, that's always been in the back of my mind.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:14):**  Another family that we had cattle with for a long time on the ranch, I'm not going to  mention their name.  I think, you know, they're up around Croft.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:22):**  I think, you know, they kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  And over the years, I've been pressured by various people to get cows and told I should  have my own cows.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:35):**  And I never really put much thought into it until a couple of years ago when I really  started thinking about it and then making some plans.  And I started thinking about, well, what do I want?  
**[0:47:47-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:47):**  Well, I want something that's going to be small.  I want something that's going to be efficient, something that's going to be fertile, something  I don't have to mess with all the time.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:47:56):**  So, that's what's steered me toward Coriantes because that to me represents more of what  an animal would look like if we weren't here trying to live here.  Because that breed had 400 years of natural selection running around the desert Southwest  
**[0:48:13-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:48:13):**  without anybody screwing with them or feeding them corn or hauling them hay all winter or  breaking ice for them, right?  I mean, they had it pretty rough.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:48:22):**  Somewhere in there, somewhere in my cow herd is some really good survivable genetics.  And I hope that over time I can take those survivable small frame genetics, upgrade that  carcass a little bit, but keep the low input and have a good product.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:48:38):**  So that's, I guess that's kind of where I'm at.  And you probably, I mean, there's no doubt you can.  The challenge there is going to be to, if you're going to keep replacements, to be able  
**[0:48:53-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:48:53):**  to keep the female you want, but supply a steer that the market will purchase unless  you market yourself.  And that's, I think I'm going to have to market myself.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:04):**  The conventional commodity production system is not for me.  I mean, that doesn't mean you'll never see me at your cell bar.  It's just not for me.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:15):**  And I have kept all of my heifers, all my heifer calves the last two years are still  out there with the cows.  They're living with the cows.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:22):**  Like this year's calves were only separate from the cows for 47 days and they got dumped  right back with them.  They went to wheat pasture and had just a minimum of feed.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:31):**  I mean, I'm not babying them.  I'm treating these heifers, these heifer calves from birth exactly like the cows I wish they  were.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:37):**  And hopefully that drives me to my goal.  I mean, it sounds good in theory, right?  And I mean, I imagine you'll like that female.  
**[0:49:49-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:49:49):**  And if you can, whether it be grass fed or more conventionally fed and sold off the ranch  to the consumer, that animal probably supplies a carcass that is very appealing to somebody  buying a quarter or half a beef.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:50:11):**  In today's mass beef industry, that animal probably doesn't get big enough, probably  doesn't have enough performance, even though it may be very efficient to have a repeat  purchaser come in the feeder cattle realm for it.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:50:29):**  Right.  They're going to want them to finish at 14 to 16 and they'll probably finish a lot closer  to 11 or 12.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:50:34):**  Right.  And at 11 or 12, I mean, it's just going to be just as good as it was if it was a bigger  animal.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:50:42):**  Now, while we're talking about carcass size, did we cover it earlier about how big carcasses  make the packer more money?  We mentioned it.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:50:54):**  Can we unpack that a little bit?  Well, I mean, it takes the same amount of time, effort and energy to buy that animal,  process that animal that hangs a 750 pound carcass as it does the one with the 1050 pound  
**[0:51:14-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:51:14):**  carcass.  So even though there is discounts for heavy carcasses and more so off of small producers  and retained ownership people than there is the big boys, you know, don't kid yourself.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:51:28):**  They want a carcass as big as they can get one.  I'm glad you said that because I have heard in the last year of people that have, you  know, have taken exactly what they thought the packer wanted, you know, a 1650 and own  
**[0:51:43-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:51:43):**  it all the way to the packer door.  And the packer just like absolutely butchered him on price and didn't give him anything  for him.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:51:51):**  And the next guy in line brought in a pair of 1200 pounders and got a premium.  And it's almost like a lot of this stuff doesn't make sense.  And I bet some of it circles back to those alternative marketing agreements that are  
**[0:52:04-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:52:04):**  secret backroom deals.  Yeah, the big outfits, the mega corporations, the people that feed 120,000, 30,000 cattle  and more, they have a different grid than your neighbor or my neighbor retaining ownership  
**[0:52:18-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:52:18):**  in their cattle.  Probably and that's why I said as seed stock people and people that sell bulls, our focus  needs to probably cap on the growth here, not only for the cow size for the rancher,  
**[0:52:33-0:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:52:33):**  but we're actually making an animal that if you take some of these performance calves  right now and you put them out on wheat and you make them weigh nine or 1000 on wheat  before they go on feed, they're going to in order to be fat, they're going to provide  
**[0:52:51-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:52:51):**  a carcass that 30% of that pen is going to be discounted for heavy carcasses.  The AMAs and like I say, the big feed yards, you know, they have allowances for those heavy  carcasses.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:53:04):**  They don't get discounted.  Their same neighbor that we were talking about earlier, father put a pen of kettle, home  raised kettle on the grid, would have been out of our bulls.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:53:19):**  Kettle gained 5.1.  Wow.  Convert 5.4 to one.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:53:24):**  Did everything you can ask them to do.  Yeah.  There was about 30% heavy carcasses, but there was 15% prime and like 55% CAB.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:53:36):**  Long story short, the discounts for the heavy carcasses allowed the packer to steal the  prime and the CABs.  Where a big corporation feeding them wouldn't have got discounted for those heavy carcasses.  
**[0:53:49-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:53:49):**  Some of them were five, 10 pounds over the 10 50 threshold.  And so, you know, here's my problem there.  It makes me angry to hear things like that.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:54:04):**  If in that packing house there was a separate box for the 10 50s and up and you saw them  at Walmart, you know, rolls of burger and T bones and steaks that were 40% cheaper because  they were 10 50 and up.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:54:22):**  And the same thing with the over 30s.  You know, in the mad cow era, there was a reason that there was an over 30 discount  because it did have to be kept separate.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:54:30):**  It was not exportable.  Now that's not the case.  There's no over 30 restriction anywhere.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:54:38):**  So there's not a separate box for the over 30s either.  But they still, it's still an extra cost for over 30, isn't it?  Like don't they have to do something else with the, with the head, the spinal cord?  
**[0:54:49-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:54:49):**  You know, I'm going to play ignorant on that, but I don't think so.  Not unless it's a hard bone now, but I stand to be corrected and maybe I'm wrong.  Well hopefully a listener will write in or send me a message and tell us what we said  
**[0:55:03-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:55:03):**  wrong right there.  But they, you know, I think it's, it's wrong if not criminal that you can discount as a  packing industry, they can discount for something that they're not discounted for, but they're  
**[0:55:19-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:55:19):**  discounting something that they're charging a premium for.  I mean like the only way to get those giant tomahawk ribeyes is a giant carcass.  Like, and I think it's silly to pay $40 for a $20 ribeye steak just because it's got the  
**[0:55:31-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:55:31):**  bone still attached to it and the butcher had to do less work.  Good job marketing agencies on that one.  But the only way to get those is from those big carcasses and that's where they get their  
**[0:55:42-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:55:42):**  premiums from.  But we're getting screwed on our big carcasses, but that's what they're asking us to make.  And then, you know, there's outfits that get a premium for the same carcass that your neighbor's  
**[0:55:53-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:55:53):**  dad gets a discount for, you know, with their special grid.  Yeah.  You know, you know, they, they want certain people, certain places with a lot of cattle  
**[0:56:05-0:56:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:56:05):**  to make those 16, 1700 pound cattle to, to provide that plant with the tonnage to keep  them out of the market, to be able to buy the cattle that retained ownership of a rancher  is cheaper.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:56:20):**  I mean it, it makes business sense.  You can't argue that it, you can't argue about that, but it makes business sense.  And the same thing without the restrictions on the imports.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:56:32):**  You know, the South American meat coming in here, I think that's the packers, a ton of  money because you take those retained ownership cattle and if you're not an AMA or you're  not a huge feed yard, basically they make you feed them two, three weeks longer than  
**[0:56:49-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:56:49):**  you should.  And then here comes your, your grade four and five discounts off those prime and CAB  carcasses that they make a ton on, but then they get to discount you for the fours and  
**[0:57:00-0:57:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:00):**  fives.  Well, the fact they cut off the fours and fives, they mix with the South American import  and then sell to a American consumer with a product of the USA label on it minimally  
**[0:57:14-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:14):**  processed.  And so again, you're getting discounted for something that then they're turning into a  profit center.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:21):**  Right.  Now, cry over spilt milk, they're better at their job than we've been.  They just, they have a lower cost of labor and lower cost of operations.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:29):**  They don't have to pay $60,000 to go buy a new pickup to put a $15,000 bail bed on to  feed cows.  Their cost of doing business down in Brazil is cheaper.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:44):**  Now we should have been more proactive a long time ago, fighting for our position, but everybody  was home making a living.  And quite honestly, well, we had the checkoff telling us that imports were okay, that we  
**[0:57:56-0:58:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:57:56):**  had to balance the imports because we wanted to export and we had to balance those out  and that the imports were benefiting the American cow.  When I don't see how that happened.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:06):**  Yeah.  And that's what I think everybody, everybody stayed reserved because they thought that  there was associations and check off and, and everything that they paid into and every  
**[0:58:21-0:58:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:21):**  association they supported, they thought was working on their behalf and they weren't.  And that's how we found our place, you know, where we're at now.  Well, I think everybody probably understands the checkoff well enough, you know, so the  
**[0:58:38-0:58:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:38):**  checkoff is funded by every time I sell a cow at the barn, I pay a dollar, the barn  pays a dollar, right?  Just you pay the dollar.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:46):**  Just I pay the dollar.  Okay.  And that's to promote beef.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:51):**  The problem I've always had with the checkoff is I'm not in the beef business.  I'm in the grass business.  I'm in the cattle business now, but I've always been in the grass business.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:58:59):**  Now I'm in the cattle business.  I'm trying to be in the beef business on my own scale, on my own terms.  But for the most part, the checkoff promotes a product that we're not selling.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:59:13):**  They're promoting the product that the packers are selling and the packers are dependent  on us, but at the same time, they also get us at the price.  And they're the only entity in the chain that does not pay the checkoff.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:59:26):**  And I was going to get to that.  They don't pay the checkoff, but they're the prime beneficiaries of it.  And you know, we talked about how the checkoff has told us that, you know, these imports  
**[0:59:36-0:59:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:59:36):**  are a good thing.  These checkoff, and you know, they're good things for the American producers.  I'll come out and say it.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:59:43):**  You know, JBS, I wonder how many cattle are owned by JBS that like aren't actually owned  by JBS that they have control over that they're raising in Brazil, that they're importing  here and selling.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=0:59:59):**  Do you think any of that's going on or do you think they're buying it from, you know,  Jose, what's his name, independent cattle rancher in Brazil?  I have no idea how cattle ranching works in Brazil.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:00:09):**  Oh, it'd be some of both.  But you know, ding, while that they've got, you know, a lot of those cattle that they  have purchaser contracted that are in the country or that they've paid for the people  
**[1:00:22-1:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:00:22):**  to start the production.  You know, they're a powerful outfit down there.  You know, one time they own more of the currency than the government did.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:00:34):**  And they used it to bribe the government, got in trouble with it.  Mike Calacrate brought this up.  You know Mike, don't you?  
**[1:00:42-1:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:00:42):**  I think you guys have talked a couple of times.  He'd asked the USDA previously, why are the Batista brothers, they're convicted felons  in their home country, why are they allowed to participate in the meat industry here because  
**[1:00:57-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:00:57):**  the USDA laws say convicted felons can't participate in the meat industry.  And that's one of those things that happened that came out of the 1920s with Packers, along  with Packers and Stockyards Act.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:01:09):**  And Mike said what the USDA told him was, well, they're convicted in Brazil, not in  America so they can do business.  Well then just as it happened a couple of months ago, they got convicted of that bribery  
**[1:01:21-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:01:21):**  deal here and had to pay a huge fine and he's asked the USDA again what their position is  on convicted felons owning a major meat packing conglomerate.  And I'll have to circle back.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:01:34):**  I'll have to give Mike a call tomorrow and see if he's got an answer to that one.  But that might be kind of amusing.  I'm sure they'll find a loophole that it's all right.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:01:43):**  Yeah, there always is.  There's always loopholes and carve outs and special interests.  But how can we get the next generation excited in the real lifestyle and about cattle and  
**[1:01:58-1:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:01:58):**  raising cattle?  You know, I don't know, Brian.  Quite honestly, if things don't change, I think you're probably doing a disservice to  
**[1:02:10-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:02:10):**  them trying to get them to.  You know, I don't know.  Okay, well let's pause there.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:02:22):**  And I share some of your feelings.  Like you know, there's a lot wrong with our industry.  Why would anybody want to move to Pratt?  
**[1:02:30-1:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:02:30):**  Why would anybody want to move to Medicine Lodge or to Sun City?  I get it.  But there's a charm.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:02:38):**  There's a beauty out here that doesn't exist anywhere else on earth.  There's some of the friendliest people on earth out here in middle America.  You broke down alongside of a road, you won't find a stranger.  
**[1:02:51-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:02:51):**  Somebody will be along to check on you and see if you need help.  And the farther out in the bush you are, you might have to wait a little bit longer, but  somebody will come and they will be friendly.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:04):**  What is it about our lifestyle?  What is it about our location?  What is it about this business of raising cattle that has any attractiveness for a young  
**[1:03:11-1:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:11):**  person these days?  And I struggle with this question.  I really do.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:16):**  We look at the cost of doing business.  Not just what cost have done the last couple of years, the barrier to entry for land.  You and I both, I think we can probably agree that you can't go anywhere in Barbara or Pratt  
**[1:03:30-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:30):**  County today and buy a ranch and pay for it by running cows.  That's not going to happen.  Maybe if it was a small enough acreage, a couple of cows, a bunch of chickens, some  
**[1:03:41-1:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:41):**  geese, some turkeys, some pigs, and some sheep and some goats, and maybe a milk cow, and  you're really diversified and worked your butt off, maybe.  But that's not an attractive lifestyle either, is it?  
**[1:03:53-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:03:53):**  Yeah.  Again, that's probably why we're in the position we are, because the people that are here and  the people that have come back and the people that want to do it are willing to do it for  
**[1:04:05-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:04:05):**  a lot of risk and very little reward for that lifestyle and to live here where there's good  people and whatever.  My core group, everybody loves it here.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:04:21):**  They all have desire and wants for their children to be here, but how many of them... I hate  to show my age here, but a lot of us are getting to the age... We have kids that are the age  that are grown and going to the workforce.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:04:34):**  Or about ready to have their own kids.  If you're still operating your place, you don't have the ability to bring that kid home  and pay them a living wage for them to raise a family and you also.  
**[1:04:52-1:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:04:52):**  You know, there's 200 cow herds that the land was paid off, the cows are paid off, and they're  surviving with a lot less overhead than somebody new entering the business.  He passes away the one kid that wants to come in that has to buy out three siblings and  
**[1:05:12-1:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:05:12):**  now he has an interest load in the cows and the land.  They cannot live on the 200 cows.  So if they want to do that, them and their old lady have to have a job in town and then  
**[1:05:25-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:05:25):**  them and their kids have to run those cows of an evening and weekends.  That's what you're asking for entry into this business.  Yeah, and there's a whole deeper rabbit holes about succession planning and one of the things  
**[1:05:44-1:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:05:44):**  that's coming around in the regenerative circle is it's not regenerative if you don't know  who you're passing it on to.  And I can agree with that and it goes right along with what we're saying.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:05:56):**  But how do we fix it?  Lack of profitability is the problem.  Is a problem, not the problem.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:06:05):**  The problem is lack of access to markets, fair markets, and competition in the markets.  And the control of those markets, the gatekeeper is the hacker.  So I think there's two ways that we can really start to rebuild our rural economies.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:06:25):**  Cows build towns, right?  You say that all the time and I love it.  Cows build towns, probably title of this episode.  
**[1:06:34-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:06:34):**  If cows build towns, we need to have more cows build more towns.  I don't think that's true.  We need to get more people involved with the cows and we need to get more slaughter plants  
**[1:06:47-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:06:47):**  to handle the cows.  We need to get some more sale barns back.  How many sale barns have left in the last 20 years that you've bought?  
**[1:06:55-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:06:55):**  How many sale barns have you bought at in the last 20 years that aren't open anymore?  It'd be at least 10, maybe more.  I'd have to think about that one, but that migrations, you know, more and more as the  
**[1:07:14-1:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:07:14):**  economy scale gets bigger, more people are vertically integrated with the packer and  they bypass that sale barn.  That's been a cause for a lot of it.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:07:27):**  You know, a lot of the kettle never come back through a sale barn for various reasons.  Maybe you did it for 30 years and now you can't get banked or don't have the funding  to do it.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:07:38):**  And so now you're doing it with a large feedlot, putting them out on you or you're taking kettle  into the, on the game for a feed yard and then boom, there they go.  You can't rewrite history.  
**[1:07:53-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:07:53):**  The best thing the Chekhov could have done in retrospect was build small packers every  200 miles.  And that would have done a couple, three things in today's ag community.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:08:07):**  It would have kept the money in the regions, number one.  It kept transportation lower.  It would have kept the sale barns in business.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:08:14):**  It would have kept people instead of cattlemen becoming bigger cattlemen and farmers becoming  bigger farmers and specialists.  You'd have had people still doing both, you know, 30, 40 years ago.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:08:30):**  And that would have kept these co-ops from becoming big conglomerates and huge profit  margins and holding the farmers at ransom, everything they buy because you'd have kept  feeding cattle at home.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:08:44):**  You'd have fed your grain to the cattle and you'd have cut out a lot of middlemen and  that would have kept that money in Kansas.  That would have kept your kid to be able to come back.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:08:54):**  Right.  Keeping the meat plant here.  I mean, that's a lot of good paying jobs.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:01):**  And I think you and I both know, like that's where most of the wealth is extracted right  now in the whole beef production cycle is, is that 24 hours that it spends in a packing  house.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:15):**  That's where all the wealth is extracted.  So in my mind, like if we really want to start revitalizing our rural economies and rebuilding  our towns, we've got to process cows in town.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:24):**  Yep.  That's, you know, you know, regional packers was the way to go.  It would have kept a thriving farmer feeder, local demand.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:37):**  We wouldn't be shipping the things four, five, 600 miles.  Then we wouldn't be sending them all to a packer that half of them are foreign owned  in them.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:46):**  Even the Packers profit doesn't stay in America.  And that's, I think that's definitely one of the more disturbing things about the Packers  is two of the biggest are foreign owned, JBS, Smithfield and Smithfield.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:09:59):**  Their money goes to China.  JBS goes to Brazil.  We have such a small amount of Packers.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:10:05):**  It's almost like in today's world, it's a favor to us that they will process them.  If you had those local Packers, they would have worked downhill with the producers to  have that constant supply and have that product they needed.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:10:22):**  You probably still would have seen quote unquote vertical integration, but it would have been  vertical integration to make that local Packers slash community slash rancher survive and  all be profitable, not vertical integration of, hey, you've got to work on a $25 head  
**[1:10:41-1:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:10:41):**  margin or we're not going to deal with you.  Yeah, it always blows my mind how the Packer can say, well, you're just going to work on  this margin and that's what you're going to do.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:10:52):**  That doesn't work like that for me.  It never works like that.  And we've lost the cattle cycle.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:10:59):**  NCBA wants to claim it's still alive and they all want to point back to 1415 when the cattle  market got good.  But I think one of the big misnomers and something that probably people don't understand there  
**[1:11:16-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:11:16):**  is that even with the reduced numbers then because of the drought, the producers leverage  did not take the market where we went.  We did not have leverage there.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:11:32):**  What happened there was drought was front page news on everything.  Cow herd being smaller was front page news on everything.  And the funds got into the CME and ran that board up and the Packers knew it was a freight  
**[1:11:49-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:11:49):**  train and they had to buy the board.  And so there was self-fulfilling prophecy.  They were along the board, the funds were along the board.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:11:55):**  The more they gave for the fat cattle, they netted them the same.  You got to explain that to me like I'm five because you're using high level cow trading  terms that I just don't have burned into my brain yet.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:12:07):**  Well like in the CME, I used to.  The theory of that was to be a pricing structure and a risk management tool for producers.  Well that's turned into today that the algorithms and the funds are the biggest players in that.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:12:28):**  And most producers are sellers of the market.  30, 40 years ago, these feed yard managers, if the thing got too cheap or the Packers  were busting their balls too much, they'd buy the board.  
**[1:12:41-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:12:41):**  What does buying the board mean?  Purchase the live cattle market at what it is on the CME.  Instead of selling it.  
**[1:12:52-1:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:12:52):**  As a producer, most producers are a seller for hedging their product.  And when you buy the board, you take all the supply away.  Well and you're purchasing, so you're raising the price on paper or on the Merck.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:13:10):**  But you had cowboys that would buckle up and try to combat the Packers selling the board  to buy cattle cheaper by buying the board.  In today's risk cycle, that just doesn't happen.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:13:26):**  But the funds are the major players in the board.  And so managed money is the one playing all the markets.  It's what gets in the grain and runs them $2 too high and then they correct.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:13:37):**  And same thing, well the funds are what drove the cattle market up.  Okay.  I mean it wasn't the fact that reduced numbers give the producers leverage.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:13:47):**  And we demanded that.  Okay.  So, basically what we're sitting here for what we used to call a cattle cycle or if  
**[1:13:56-1:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:13:56):**  we're waiting for numbers to decrease and return leverage to the producer, that's not  going to happen.  You think the cycle broke?  
**[1:14:05-1:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:14:05):**  It's, I mean, it's, what we're waiting for is the cow herd reports to be smaller.  Managed money to decide, oh man, there's less cattle around here.  They purchase the board, run the futures price up.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:14:26):**  Packers get scared.  They buy the board to get the next year's inventory which runs the price up even more.  Then people start selling cattle faster.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:14:38):**  Kettle will turn over with less weight, which takes off carcass weight.  And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy just for a little bit.  Which will drive prices up, which will spike prices.  
**[1:14:51-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:14:51):**  So I've talked a little bit about the cycle with several other friends and the consensus  seems to be that the signals are the cows are about ready to start going up, to depreciate.  Would you agree with that?  
**[1:15:12-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:15:12):**  I think so, but it's probably not going to happen  as fast as we think it will for a couple reasons.  Fourteen and fifteen got wild and furious and a lot of those cows on a five or seven  
**[1:15:30-1:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:15:30):**  year note, people realize they give way too much for them.  Number two.  And those are just all coming out of inventory now.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:15:41):**  Those should be coming out of production.  Not very many ranchers buy cows.  Most ranchers raise cows.  
**[1:15:49-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:15:49):**  And so farmers buy cows.  Today's farmer is becoming less of a stockman, not more.  I would definitely agree with that statement.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:16:01):**  Farmers are getting bigger, more specialized.  So I don't think that female market is going to be as increased as dramatically as even  the calf or feeder deal will.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:16:15):**  I think the lack of players in that market is going to keep a cap on that.  You think we're just going to see a soft bump, not a mountain like we did?  Right, not that they can't appreciate, but just like I say, I mean, there's more farmers  
**[1:16:32-1:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:16:32):**  getting rid of their cows than looking to purchase cows.  You know, they want to farm more acreage, especially with grain prices where they are  going to be professional farmers.  
**[1:16:44-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:16:44):**  They're not looking to be stockman also.  I think the skill set it takes to be a stockman is something that you have to feed and you  have to continually work at your whole life in order to have mastery over it, even if  
**[1:16:58-1:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:16:58):**  you can't ever master being a stockman.  So other than building more regional packing plants and spreading out some of this packing  capacity and opening up some of these marketing channels, the problem with these big mega  
**[1:17:13-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:17:13):**  plants is they're designed to run a specific kind of carcass.  And the people that buy for that plant, they're going to buy specific kinds of cattle.  There's coal cow plants and then there's plants that only handle steers of a certain weight,  
**[1:17:27-1:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:17:27):**  right?  So if we could build out some of these more of these regional plants, we'll have flexibility  in these small processors that will take a cow, that will take cows one day, take steers  
**[1:17:39-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:17:39):**  the next day or maybe take a killer bull the third day.  You know what I'm saying.  More flexibility which creates more competition.  
**[1:17:51-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:17:51):**  What can we do to reform the fed cattle marketing on that conventional side?  Well the number one thing that we could do is enforce the packers and stockyards laws.  If we can't get that done, you know I guess I'm a bad guy to ask because we've been jumping  
**[1:18:19-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:18:19):**  from the rooftops and we think we get some steam or think there's going to be some assistance  and the legislators don't have any idea about our business.  You know even the ones from the ag states.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:18:37):**  Very few that are educated or versed and you know the first hurdles that you've got to  go through a two-hour animal science lesson with any legislature you talk to.  This is a cow.  
**[1:18:51-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:18:51):**  This is a bull.  This is a heifer.  The next thing is our political systems ran on money and we don't have any.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:19:02):**  Everybody we're fighting has a lobbyist and everybody we're fighting donates to put the  right candidate in and their opinions are bought off from day one.  They're told what to think on a group of issues by somebody that hands them a check.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:19:20):**  So I hate to be Debbie Downer here but I'm not so sure that the rancher or the producer  has a lot of chance in this fight until we come up with funding to supply a lobby on  our behalf.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:19:35):**  That's just the way the rules and the laws in this country work.  We can play around with that for a minute.  How would I wonder what that would look like?  
**[1:19:45-1:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:19:45):**  So do you think we could maybe get checkoff funds for a producer-led lobby?  You know that would be my opinion and or like you know Mark Winter said that from the get-go  of when we started messing with the reform of the checkoff.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:20:04):**  He said do you realize you know you're fighting this group that's making you know hundreds  of millions a month and here we are worried about a dollar ahead when their margins are  seven or eight hundred.  
**[1:20:22-1:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:20:22):**  He said now take that dollar ahead and put it towards a lobby and you might get somewhere  but just stand alone as a dollar ahead it's peanuts.  My couple hundred bucks and gonna do crap in the whole scheme of things.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:20:40):**  But like how do we get 80% of cattle producers to agree on this is what we need to lobby  for for our industry?  That's the other thing unification or Ag seen it and seen it and seen it I mean that's that  
**[1:20:55-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:20:55):**  seems to be the insurmountable hurdle.  You know take the checkoff reform I don't know if one out of a hundred people that if  I could personally talk to had been against it and everybody else that was working at  
**[1:21:15-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:21:15):**  it same thing.  But getting them to see it pay attention to it do it online.  Go sign the stupid petition.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:21:26):**  Just won't happen.  God it was such a simple thing to ask to do.  I mean I obviously did it and I know you did it but I just when the signature totals start  
**[1:21:37-1:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:21:37):**  coming up I was just blown away like there's no way that few people signed this.  Like the amount of support people said that they had for this like to just nobody see  it are we in that small of an echo chamber that nobody freaking saw it?  
**[1:21:51-1:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:21:51):**  If you had time to sit at every sale barn for two months straight and personally talk  to everybody that brought cattle in you might get it done.  Because they'll sign it if you're there in person and somebody presents it to them but  
**[1:22:10-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:22:10):**  if it's just laying on a counter or you're asking them to do it electronic.  Scroll scroll scroll.  You just don't get don't get the traction.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:22:19):**  And then again you know it gets down to it gets down to the labor manpower and what things  cost and you know I'm one man you're one man and we agree that these things are important.  We can agree that you know that some effort should be put in this direction but at the  
**[1:22:33-1:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:22:33):**  end of the day you know I'm gonna get up tomorrow and cows got to be fed.  Ice is gonna have to be broke.  Fences are gonna have to be checked.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:22:40):**  You know you've got stuff to do.  We've got animals to keep alive.  We've got you know.  
**[1:22:45-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:22:45):**  The producer's real power and it frustrates me that they don't realize it enough to use  it is their dollar.  Whether it's in these small communities or bigger corporations.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:23:04):**  We're not talking about the checkoff dollar.  No but their dollar they spend whatever it is their veterinary supplies their feed supplies  their pickups their fuels their you know if they held who they purchase things from accountable  
**[1:23:19-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:23:19):**  and made them be a voice for them then we gain some traction.  Brian Alexander and Steve Stratford Cohen Jerry Moran were one constituent right and  our name recognition is Zbro right in Washington DC.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:23:36):**  Just just some random guy guys out there in the middle of Kansas.  We don't need to worry about what they had to say.  But just go up the step ladder up a cans of co-op an American Angus Association livestock  
**[1:23:48-1:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:23:48):**  John Deere's Purina's neutrino.  I mean those people come on board and start fighting for you.  They do have name recognition.  
**[1:24:00-1:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:24:00):**  You tell senators and representatives that here's these 12 corporations that are signing  onto this bill then that carries clout and that's what has to be done.  And you can bring those people to the table.  
**[1:24:15-1:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:24:15):**  They fall with the other side by default because they want to go sit at the conventions or  the you know highfalutin things and sit at the table with them.  But those places aren't the ones that that pay their salaries and pay them to run around  
**[1:24:28-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:24:28):**  and buy their product.  You know the ranchers do the farmers do.  And so if you would only do business with people that are proactive for you it may take  
**[1:24:41-1:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:24:41):**  paying a little more or going a little further for a while.  It matters that you would bring everybody to their milk.  It matters and it adds up.  
**[1:24:50-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:24:50):**  They could do that just like that and that everything I mean take a sale barn for instance.  So you're out speaking for a producer or you're trying to fundamentally change a business  and corporations purchase a lot of cattle.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:25:11):**  Well the corporations pay attention to what you're saying and they inform you that it's  not your business or you shouldn't be worried about it.  Well they have the time to have somebody in that office call those people that own the  
**[1:25:27-1:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:25:27):**  sale barn.  What needs to happen is a hundred producers call and say the reason you're getting my  cattle is because you are fighting for us.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:25:39):**  But you don't get those calls so you don't get that reinforcement of ownership to take  a hold.  They don't hear anything from that side but you hear it from the corporation side that  
**[1:25:54-1:26:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:25:54):**  it's not our business.  Stay in your lane.  They need to be louder.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:26:03):**  They need to be more boasterous with their opinion and they need to vote with their dollar.  I like it and that's not the first time I've heard you say that and it's definitely important.  The John Deere dealer has a tremendously loud voice.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:26:21):**  If everybody that listened to this podcast, if all of your friends, if half of your friends  would go into the John Deere dealership and say, hey you need to support this check offer  for them.  
**[1:26:31-1:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:26:31):**  You need to get behind your beef producers.  The reality is Steve, if they don't in 20 or 30 years maybe none of these jobs will  be here.  
**[1:26:43-1:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:26:43):**  Maybe all these new shiny tractor dealerships and crop consultant pickups and seed distributors  whoops they won't be here because we're not going to be here with the cattle.  We're not going to be here with the crops.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:26:56):**  Yeah and you get the economy scales that keep getting bigger.  I mean those people can buy 10 tractors and get them shipped from wherever.  They don't need their local guy.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:27:06):**  They don't need the dealership service tech because they've got enough stuff.  They'll just hire their own mechanic.  There's very few places in this business that you can go out power who were up against and  
**[1:27:23-1:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:27:23):**  at the retail sector you can.  You know the major packers in the corporate feed yards don't buy enough John Deere tractors  that their voice is bigger than the ag producer in the United States.  
**[1:27:42-1:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:27:42):**  They don't buy enough feed from neutrino-parina co-ops that their voice is bigger than the  producers.  Same caterpillar, whatever it is.  
**[1:27:55-1:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:27:55):**  So I mean that's our power is to force those people that depend on our purchasing dollar  to voice, to stand up and do something for us and we've never required that of them.  How many producers do you know that say I buy cake from here not because it's 220 a  
**[1:28:15-1:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:15):**  ton versus 240 but because this guy's doing something for me other than selling me the  cake?  Right.  
**[1:28:24-1:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:24):**  Same product, two different guys.  One might be $5 more expensive but he's the guy that comes around, rides around with me,  looks at the cows, makes a recommendation.  
**[1:28:34-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:34):**  The other guy calls me on the phone every couple of months and says what do you need?  But is he calling as, hey I'm manager of such and such co-op or I'm manager of the John  Deere in Pratt, Kansas and does he call his senators and representatives and work for  
**[1:28:49-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:49):**  you?  Good question.  Is he trying to keep you in business?  
**[1:28:53-1:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:53):**  Good questions.  They don't.  Nobody makes them do it.  
**[1:28:56-1:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:28:56):**  You just continue to go there because he's local or it's who you always have or it's  who your dad did.  There isn't anybody else within 100 miles to do business with.  
**[1:29:07-1:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:29:07):**  You've got to do your business with people that are going to go to bat for you and that's  how ag can climb this mountain.  I think that other than hopes and dreams of market reform or checkoff reform or of some  
**[1:29:28-1:29:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:29:28):**  miracle legislative relief to break up the big packers, I think really pressuring the  people that support us that we do business with as cattlemen, pressuring them to have  our backs.  
**[1:29:42-1:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:29:42):**  I think that's our best shot at getting anything done honestly.  Yeah, I do too.  Like I say, people will take the path of least resistance.  
**[1:29:51-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:29:51):**  So you're thinking those people are just going to do it on their own?  No.  Aren't going to.  
**[1:29:56-1:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:29:56):**  And you need to tell them why you're leaving them and why you're going somewhere else.  They need to hear it because it's too long of a process for them to watch 5%, 5%, 5%  leave.  
**[1:30:08-1:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:30:08):**  They need to hear why you're leaving.  You know, hey, I liked your service.  I've done business with you forever, but I'm switching to here because they're working  
**[1:30:18-1:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:30:18):**  for me.  Because they signed the checkoff reform petition and they sent their dues to this other organization.  Speaking of organizations, what are some good organizations that you know are fighting for  
**[1:30:30-1:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:30:30):**  the cattle?  And we can talk about any one of them you want to mention.  I just don't want to lead you on here.  
**[1:30:43-1:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:30:43):**  You know, ARCAF.  I'm a member.  And I would be guilty of it.  
**[1:30:49-1:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:30:49):**  I mean, ARCAF was probably dismissed as radical 30 years ago.  But as far as an American rancher, their efforts and their policy and what they want probably  aligned better for the American producer than anybody.  
**[1:31:13-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:31:13):**  And then quite honestly, if you fast forward 30 years from when you thought they were radical,  they were exactly right.  So they were really ahead of the game.  
**[1:31:23-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:31:23):**  It's like, what does that mean that's been going around conspiracy theorist or just predicting  the future?  You know, everybody sat there and thought, oh, no, no, no.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:31:35):**  But you know, if people that got on board and paid attention, I mean, it's exactly what's  happened.  And they were trying to fight this battle before it happened.  
**[1:31:46-1:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:31:46):**  And you know, that's an organization that those people are all working for basically nothing.  They get up and fight the battle and work tireless hours.  And they are working for the people.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:32:01):**  And they are us.  Like there is, I don't think there's a single ARCAF board member that isn't already a full-time  rancher.  
**[1:32:09-1:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:32:09):**  You go to the convention.  I went up and spoke a couple of years ago and you know, the membership are just great  people.  
**[1:32:19-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:32:19):**  You know, regular communist, big shit, everyday people.  You know, I guess it's probably not a hidden topic, but I'm not a fan of NCBA.  You don't have to high bet for me, Steve.  
**[1:32:40-1:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:32:40):**  Most of NCBA's policies fall in line for mega corporations and big commercial feed yards.  I don't see the last 20 years that I've been paying attention that they do anything market-wise  for ranchers and farmer feeders and smaller producers.  
**[1:33:01-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:33:01):**  Now, to be fair, environmental laws, animal rights and some of the congressional fight  in some of those areas, they do do some good.  I 100%.  
**[1:33:21-1:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:33:21):**  Now, are they doing that for Brian Alexander and Steve Stratford or are they doing that  for their mega corps and packers buddies and we-  They're doing it for-  
**[1:33:31-1:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:33:31):**  By default.  We're benefiting by default.  Like, we're collateral damage, I think would be the correct term.  
**[1:33:37-1:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:33:37):**  They do have a strong enough voice and a big enough, powerful enough lobby that they do  do us some good there.  You know, and then KLA falls under that umbrella.  
**[1:33:50-1:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:33:50):**  But market-wise, survivability rise, percent of the retail dollar, I don't think they really  care if the average producer out here survives or not.  I would agree.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:34:02):**  I would definitely agree with that.  You think that feedlot concentration is just as much of a problem as packer concentration?  No, it's not as much of a problem.  
**[1:34:21-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:34:21):**  If feed yards would have remained smaller, would we be in some of the problem we are?  No.  If farmer feeders had remained more prevalent because you wouldn't have had the economy  
**[1:34:34-1:34:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:34:34):**  of scale to make the AMA so enticing and the formulas and have so many of these cattle  that are unpriced and handed to them.  They keep them out of the market.  
**[1:34:46-1:35:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:34:46):**  More feedlots means instead of one guy going to buy eight loads, it's eight guys going  to buy one load.  So the AMAs and the formulas basically actually have allowed the packers to actually own less  
**[1:35:01-1:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:35:01):**  cattle and less feedlots themselves.  You know, they used to have to own them and they used to have to feed those cattle in  order to have ponds on the on the chessboard to use against you in the cash market.  
**[1:35:17-1:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:35:17):**  Now they have the people that have the AMAs and the formula cattle, they're doing that  for them.  You know, feeding 200,000 cattle and working on X amount of margin and they're supplying  
**[1:35:31-1:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:35:31):**  those cattle to use against you.  Can you explain how that formula marketing arrangement works?  Well they're tied into one packer.  
**[1:35:44-1:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:35:44):**  And those cattle are priced at, you know, the Western Kansas average plus.  The plus is the question.  Right.  
**[1:35:57-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:35:57):**  So what is Western Kansas average and how do they figure that out?  The Western Kansas average is off of, you know, the average of the of the cash market,  which is hard to establish a lot of weeks now.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:36:13):**  So how do we establish a value on the cash market if when there's not a lot of cash trade  because everything is on the dark market of AMAs?  For the naysayers of the fact that more cash is not good for the market, I would use the  
**[1:36:30-1:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:36:30):**  last five months comparison.  I mean, if you want to reverse, my timing is going to be off here, but you want to reverse  eight weeks ago, we were probably still stuck in the 126 hole for fed cattle.  
**[1:36:42-1:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:36:42):**  Sounds about right.  Boxed beef was probably 310, 315.  That's about that.  
**[1:36:51-1:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:36:51):**  Yep.  Probably we're trading.  There's no producer hiding over there to fact check.  
**[1:36:56-1:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:36:56):**  It's like on Rogan.  I'm not that good yet.  Probably 30 to 50,000 a week cash trade.  
**[1:37:03-1:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:03):**  Okay.  Last week we traded almost a hundred thousand cash trade.  Wow.  
**[1:37:10-1:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:10):**  It's been 80,000 plus since we broke out of that 126 hole and went to 140.  That can't be a coincidence at all.  You know, I think what probably let that happen was the feeder kettle in August was really  
**[1:37:30-1:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:30):**  good.  And so, and the board broke after about the middle of August when all those grass kettle  went on feed.  
**[1:37:40-1:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:40):**  So all the kettle that come out of the Flint Hills and the long seat, the, you know, July  15th, August 15th placements, those feeder kettle were really high.  Right.  
**[1:37:48-1:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:48):**  They were never hedgeable.  They were never contractable profit, probably not even at a hundred dollar loss for the  two months after purchase.  
**[1:37:58-1:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:37:58):**  And so none of those kettle were contracted and handed to them.  None of those kettle, very few of those kettle were hedged because they were never hedgeable.  And so when it came that those kettle were on the show list, everybody was hard to deal  
**[1:38:11-1:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:38:11):**  with.  And you didn't have hedgers when there was a four dollar basis in the, in the live futures  market selling cash cheap and it allowed the market to go up.  
**[1:38:23-1:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:38:23):**  Hence we trade more cash kettle.  So if we're trading, you said that it was a hundred thousand a week?  Just shy of it last week, I think 96 ish.  
**[1:38:36-1:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:38:36):**  So that's, and we slaughter what about 650, 660,000 a week is average US slaughter.  So we're talking about, my math sucks today, like way less than 20%, like 15%, 15, 18%  of the market.  
**[1:38:52-1:39:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:38:52):**  And that's huge comparison.  Compared to what it normally is, which is you said about half that or maybe less.  So five, 7% is what it normally is.  
**[1:39:00-1:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:39:00):**  And we're looking at, you know, 10, 15.  I mean, we're, we're still looking at peanuts.  Like, and the point that I want to make is that it's really ridiculous to use 10% of  
**[1:39:13-1:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:39:13):**  the total market that's controlled by four people to set the price for so much of the  rest.  And like, it's really, I can't understand how people will look at that situation and  
**[1:39:28-1:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:39:28):**  say, well, the Packers don't control that.  They don't have, you know, that doesn't affect price.  Anybody should be able to see that, that that small amount of cash trade, which is the basis  
**[1:39:41-1:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:39:41):**  of the price for all of these dark marketing agreements and AMAs, like that's just not  right, because that is way too small of a percentage to accurately represent anything  going on in any market forces that are actually happening.  
**[1:39:59-1:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:39:59):**  And then a lot of weeks back when you're in the threshold of trading 35 to 50,000 cattle,  it is the below average cattle.  If you consider the 600,000, and that's the other part of it, that want to go to the grid  
**[1:40:14-1:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:40:14):**  and want to say that you're getting these premiums, but if your base is devalued 15,  20, 30%, are you really getting a premium?  You're just getting a payment for handing them to, right.  
**[1:40:26-1:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:40:26):**  You're getting a payment for providing them to the scheduling power.  I mean, they're basically giving you a payment to throw everybody else under the bus.  More or less.  
**[1:40:38-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:40:38):**  And they don't care who gets thrown under the bus.  They don't care because they don't have, it's not their skin in the game.  They're not the ones that are having to pay for it.  
**[1:40:55-1:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:40:55):**  I would just challenge anybody that thinks that the way we market fed cattle is right  and a good market for the producers to come watch a calf and feeder auction and see how  that operates.  
**[1:41:13-1:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:41:13):**  And if we did that in the fed cattle sector, we would be a lot better off.  You know.  What do you mean by that?  
**[1:41:21-1:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:41:21):**  Well, take the five, six, seven major players in Pratt, Kansas one day.  What if before they walked into that building and we ran through the cattle we have to offer  that day, that somebody the Friday before give them 80 to 85% of their needs based off  
**[1:41:45-1:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:41:45):**  the price they walk in there to give.  First thing, you're giving them all the reason the world not to go in and give much.  Because they already got most of what they need.  
**[1:41:54-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:41:54):**  Because they're going in to buy 10 to 15, 20% of their need but they're pricing 80%  off of that.  So what it?  
**[1:42:03-1:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:42:03):**  Yeah, they price the 80% that they're paying a premium for off the 15% of the bottom of  the barrel.  So why would you want to go in and give all that you could give for one or you know.  
**[1:42:15-1:42:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:42:15):**  They're going to tell you if I work for Tyson I'm going to go tell my buddy that works for  Cargill be like, hey this lot's mine you get the next draft.  We'll let the guy from JBS get the one after that.  
**[1:42:27-1:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:42:27):**  We'll keep everybody's prices low so we don't screw up your grid.  We don't screw up my formula.  And people don't realize just how few a private with the escalation of the grain prices and  
**[1:42:39-1:42:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:42:39):**  the fact that the farmer feeders in Iowa and Nebraska had so many challenges marketing  fed kettle.  How shallow our feeder market is.  
**[1:42:51-1:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:42:51):**  I mean there's two or three private players there that are keeping the mega corporations  honest.  And if we break them now we've turned the feeder kettle sector into a price taker.  
**[1:43:05-1:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:43:05):**  Is it just those three people keeping us from being totally chickenized?  Pretty close.  That's scary.  
**[1:43:12-1:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:43:12):**  No it's per region.  But in like in our market if you take individual or small feed yards it's pretty slim.  How many you think we've lost in the last couple years?  
**[1:43:33-1:43:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:43:33):**  Probably 15% in the last couple three years of a weekly player.  Maybe 20%.  Just for example.  
**[1:43:43-1:43:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:43:43):**  Are they aging out or quitting?  Some of both.  You know in Iowa aging out grain got high they could sell their corn at $6-$7 and not  
**[1:43:54-1:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:43:54):**  feed kettle.  And like I say challenges of marketing their fed kettle in the last three years financially  took them out.  
**[1:44:06-1:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:44:06):**  In August, September, October when there's not a lot of yearlings around.  Was the market good without them?  In February, March, April, May we're going to miss them in there because we're going  
**[1:44:26-1:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:44:26):**  to have a lot of supply.  You're going to see huge basis of those kettle without the competition in there.  And I hope something changes that they come back into the market.  
**[1:44:41-1:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:44:41):**  But like a farmer feeder trade in Iowa the last year we've probably lost 85% of them.  Wow.  Wow.  
**[1:44:54-1:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:44:54):**  That's not good.  I mean I have a gentleman I work with out of Manchester, Iowa that ran a sale barn there  and I became friends with him through another friend.  
**[1:45:08-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:45:08):**  But they sold fat cattle still at his sale barn.  And he purchased feeders for a lot of those guys that sold fats at his barn.  And I'm talking 10-12 feeders that fed 1,000 to 2,000 all the time.  
**[1:45:24-1:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:45:24):**  I haven't sent one there in the last year.  When does it stop?  When does the bleeding stop?  
**[1:45:35-1:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:45:35):**  It either stops when we do something to take our market back or it stops when they all  get big enough that we're all working for them in some margin dictated.  Seen that coming.  
**[1:45:56-1:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:45:56):**  Seen it coming where we're all kind of an employee of Tyson or Smithfield.  There was several years ago and it was one of the things that pushed me down the road  of owning cattle.  
**[1:46:12-1:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:12):**  Do I stay a custom grazer my whole life and just be content with a small piece of the  pie?  Where do I get involved?  
**[1:46:19-1:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:19):**  And do I be a part of this business that I'm kind of at the edge of?  Because the longer I stayed a custom grazer, the more I could see how that business model  would work long term.  
**[1:46:30-1:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:30):**  But I could also see where I would end up.  Which is I would end up with a long term deal with probably a feed lot that was the same  every year and it was consistent for both of us.  
**[1:46:43-1:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:43):**  And there's benefits in that.  There's stability.  We all crave stability especially as a small business owner.  
**[1:46:49-1:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:49):**  The thing you want the most in your life anymore after you start that business is you want  stability again.  Stability or cash flow, stability or expenses.  
**[1:46:59-1:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:46:59):**  That's why people get big.  That's why people get out.  I saw that in my future and I said, that's not really where I want to go with my life.  
**[1:47:09-1:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:47:09):**  I want to have more control over what I am doing than just being like a middleman to  take care of somebody else's livestock for a little bit.  Does that make sense to you?  
**[1:47:23-1:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:47:23):**  Excuse me.  So I guess what I'm saying is I'm invested and I'm trying to do these things to help  rebuild our economy, to help our communities.  
**[1:47:43-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:47:43):**  And like we talked about earlier, I think one of the best things that could bring back  some profitability and some attractiveness to rural communities is smaller packing houses,  regional packing houses.  
**[1:47:55-1:48:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:47:55):**  Let's put one in every small town in America and not run them to 100%.  I mean run a 50, 75% capacity so if we do have an event, we need to process some more  animals.  
**[1:48:07-1:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:48:07):**  It's not a problem.  The guy in the next town over, his place burns down.  The next three nearest towns can spread the load and we don't have something to happen  
**[1:48:15-1:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:48:15):**  like when you have the Tyson fire and one of the four largest plants in the world shuts  down for a couple of weeks.  It's a consumer problem.  
**[1:48:28-1:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:48:28):**  Just like with us, we talked about how as producers, how we can get people on our side,  vote with our dollar.  Farmers have to start voting with their food dollar, I think, and they have to be conscious  
**[1:48:41-1:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:48:41):**  of where they're spending that food dollar, whether it's ultimately a Tyson, Smithfield  or JBS product or whether it's a small craft branded product like you get just up here  at the street or like maybe some of your clients are starting to get into with their own branded  
**[1:48:58-1:49:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:48:58):**  beef programs.  I would love to be able to go into a grocery store either in Medicine Lodge or here in  Pratt or anywhere and have the regular commodity product that we're all used to seeing sitting  
**[1:49:11-1:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:11):**  there in the shelf but also having maybe some Alexander Ranch beef that's got Stratford  influence and maybe that's just a known thing or having, what was that other one you partnered  with, Rockin' R Heifers.  
**[1:49:27-1:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:27):**  I grew some of those Heifers for you last year, didn't I?  How'd they do?  Well, they were, yeah, they were recipes that had embryos in them so he took them back to  
**[1:49:35-1:49:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:35):**  New Mexico.  Get some good calves out of them?  I think so.  
**[1:49:39-1:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:39):**  I think they're calving right now.  Awesome.  I think they calved right before you all shipped them, started right after they were supposed  
**[1:49:45-1:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:45):**  to start.  They were in a bad drought and then they ended up having a really nice back half of the summer.  They're dry now again but so are we.  
**[1:49:54-1:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:49:54):**  It was an interesting bunch to take care of.  They'd never really taken care of any recipes, just our other mutual friends, commercial  herd which is like, you could put one of his on a coffee machine and just run 250 copies  
**[1:50:06-1:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:50:06):**  and that's kind of like, that's how he likes his cows and sometimes I'm kind of envious  of that.  We've talked about a lot of stuff and I want to end this sucker on a high note.  
**[1:50:16-1:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:50:16):**  When is the next Stratford Angus production sale?  Be the last Saturday in February.  Last Saturday in February?  
**[1:50:24-1:50:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:50:24):**  All right, if people want a sale catalog, where do they have to go?  Probably the easiest in today's world to message me on Facebook or my numbers all over everywhere.  I'll make sure it gets in the show notes.  
**[1:50:40-1:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:50:40):**  I want you to put a link to your personal page in there because you capped out on your  friends at your second Cattle Chat.  I'll make sure I get that in the show notes.  
**[1:50:48-1:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:50:48):**  Anywhere else you want me to drive traffic?  I think, you know, and probably most people that listen but you know, you can learn quite  a bit, the Kettle USA or livestock's website, you know, has a lot of the future market and  
**[1:51:03-1:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:51:03):**  a lot of news and consignments and market reports and stuff and then of course I do  the market report and I post that but you know, I guess I'm proud to work with and work  for a group that I feel we do work for producers and I value that the ownership and other management  
**[1:51:26-1:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:51:26):**  support and want to do that also.  So I'm pretty proud of that and I hope producers realize it and we're sure trying to work for  them and keep them in business because they're the ones that keep us in business.  
**[1:51:40-1:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:51:40):**  Well, I know a lot of guys around appreciate it and appreciate what you do there at Pratt  Livestock and appreciate your genetics program.  Well, before we go, you want to tell me about JR and how he's doing?  
**[1:51:53-1:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:51:53):**  Well, we'll see.  We're starting a new rodeo season.  I guess most people that follow me know he fractured his neck in the summer, rode with  
**[1:52:07-1:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:07):**  it that way for…  For those that don't follow, JR is your son.  Yeah.  
**[1:52:11-1:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:11):**  And he's how old?  19.  And he's doing what?  
**[1:52:14-1:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:14):**  He's a PRCA bull rider.  He's having pretty good luck, right?  Yeah, he did.  
**[1:52:19-1:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:19):**  He had a good start to the season, you know, did a lot of things to be proud of.  Just he started two months late this season because he had to have his shoulder rebuilt.  Then he rode in February and that ride remained the highest mark ride for the entire regular  
**[1:52:39-1:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:39):**  season.  And then in June, late June, I think he fractured his neck.  He continued to ride all through July and then finally had to give it up.  
**[1:52:48-1:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:48):**  And we just got some injections and rest and hopefully he's going to come back healed  up.  We'll see.  
**[1:52:57-1:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:52:57):**  A good deal.  He's, I think, headed to Des Moines this Friday and then Denver next week.  So pretty fun to watch.  
**[1:53:04-1:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:04):**  Well, maybe he'll get a list on this one on his way to Denver next week because I'm  going to go ahead and turn this one around for next week.  Something else happened to you recently in Indiana?  
**[1:53:13-1:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:13):**  You want to talk about that?  Yeah, I got married.  I've been dating.  
**[1:53:17-1:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:17):**  Congratulations.  My wife's age.  So thank you.  
**[1:53:22-1:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:22):**  Finally smart enough to marry her, I guess.  We got that behind us now and she's a good girl and blessed to have her.  Congratulations.  
**[1:53:31-1:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:31):**  Well, thank you.  Thanks for your time and efforts you spend at it.  Thanks for getting me on here and hopefully we'll do some good sometime.  
**[1:53:41-1:53:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:41):**  If we can change one mind.  I think if we can just open one mind at a time, I think that's about all we can do.  I think you and the thousands of others across the country that help.  
**[1:53:53-1:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:53:53):**  There's so many people.  Some people get more exposure and have a position to get more exposure, but producers should  feel pretty thankful and grateful that there is so many people out working for them.  
**[1:54:07-1:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:54:07):**  If they just hold everybody else to the same standards they'd hold their kids or their  spouses to that to work for them.  We could do something pretty special, I hope.  
**[1:54:18-1:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:54:18):**  I'd agree with that.  Is there anything that you want to get off your chest?  I forgot to ask you.  
**[1:54:27-1:54:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:54:27):**  I don't think so.  I'm thankful to be in this business and this community and I want to see it continue to  thrive and I want to see the people I work for and work with continue to be able to do  
**[1:54:42-1:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:54:42):**  what they love.  I think we need to work at some changes to make that happen.  That's why we do it.  
**[1:54:49-1:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:54:49):**  I think over the last couple of hours we've talked about what people can do and not just  they themselves they can do.  Call your legislators, put pressure on them, talk to the people that you do business with  
**[1:55:04-1:55:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:55:04):**  and pressure them to fight for you.  If they won't fight for you, take your dollars somewhere else.  The consumers get to choose who they want to support by voting with their food dollars.  
**[1:55:14-1:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:55:14):**  Us producers, we got to support the people that are supporting us with our dollars.  Look what Ag will do.  You experienced it in your country with the fire.  
**[1:55:26-1:55:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:55:26):**  Just recently had one Northeast of here.  Look what the Ag community does in situations like that.  They need to start looking at their business as a disaster and their voice and their fight  
**[1:55:39-1:55:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:55:39):**  and what they do helps that person that they would help if he had a fire as much as the  load of hay after a disaster.  So we need to look at it as a crisis situation.  
**[1:55:56-1:56:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:55:56):**  If Ag would do what they would do for their neighbor and their friends or their peer in  another state facing adversity, it would be amazing what we could get done.  Yeah, because you hear about a fire.  
**[1:56:07-1:56:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:56:07):**  Oh, there's a big wildfire, 300,000 acres.  That's all somebody needs to hear and they're like, well, I'm going to go donate a load  of hay or they're writing a check to the KLA, which is great.  
**[1:56:19-1:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:56:19):**  But we need to think about what we can do to help each other out when we're not in crisis  or when we're not in like a highly visible crisis because we're in crisis.  Like our industry is in crisis.  
**[1:56:31-1:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:56:31):**  Exactly.  And we're a powerful group and nobody works harder.  If we could just kind of get a common goal and like you say, if we would realize that  
**[1:56:43-1:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/46-Steve-Stratford-Cows-Build-Towns-e1cmkrp#t=1:56:43):**  we're in crisis mode and everybody needs to do everything they can to save our business,  it would be amazing the power we have.  I hope we're around to see it.

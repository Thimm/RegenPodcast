Lying with me today as always is CK, but today she's going to take the pilot seat and I'm  going to take the co-pilot seat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:03):**  We got a wonderful guest lined up today.  So without any further ado, here's today's pilot CK to introduce today's guest.  Awesome.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:13):**  Thank you, Brian.  So today we have Sarah Bangert.  Hi Sarah, how are you?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:16):**  I'm great.  How are you?  I'm good.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:19):**  Could you tell me where you're calling in from and what you do for a living?  Sure.  So I am calling in from Southwestern Colorado, a little farming community called Yellow Jacket  
**[0:01:35-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:35):**  is where I currently am.  And what I do for a living is I do it, well, I kind of have several enterprises to my business,  but my primary business is a targeted grazing operation coupled with meat goat production.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:01:52):**  And then I also do some rangeland consulting for some local ranches here in the area.  So that's, that's the main premise of what I do for a living.  How'd you get started doing those things?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:02:07):**  Well, I have a pretty unique background.  I've done a lot of stuff in my life and started working on my own for other folks when I was  15.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:02:19):**  So a lot of background story there, but I've always worked professionally with animals  in some form or another.  It was primarily dogs in the professional dog world up into my early twenties.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:02:34):**  And at that point I decided to go back to college and get a degree in environmental  biology and a minor in chemistry and break away from the dog world a little bit and started  getting into after my undergraduate degree, I went out and did some environmental consulting  
**[0:02:54-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:02:54):**  works for some consulting firms.  And then I fell into the range management world with the forest service.  And so that was kind of a start.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:03:03):**  You know, I grew up in a agriculture based community here in Southwestern Colorado in  a town called Mancos.  And so it's something that I've always been a part of and been around.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:03:14):**  But after falling into the range management world, I started getting into it quite a bit  more and started working for some local ranches and doing some day riding and worked down  in Northeastern New Mexico, which I still do, and Montana and continued on with the  
**[0:03:33-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:03:33):**  working in the ranch world, but also doing quite a bit of range management through the  forest service.  And so that led me down the path of really falling in love with agriculture in general.  
**[0:03:46-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:03:46):**  And I went back and got my master's degree in range management and continued down the  forest service path until I was offered a job to do to manage a small ranch in Southwestern  Colorado, where we were doing a little bit of, we were going to try to do some grass  
**[0:04:01-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:01):**  finished beef and things like that.  And what ended up happening was I decided that the best enterprise for that ranch was  going to be goats.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:10):**  And that there was a real opportunity down here in this area for the targeted grazing.  And so I just kind of took it and ran with it from there.  I think that's great.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:21):**  Brian?  Yeah, so you went to college and a master's degree, which is impressive.  I didn't go.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:29):**  So did it help and what would you change about what that system is teaching for a ranch management  degree?  Well, it was range management, so not quite ranch management, but I have an interesting  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:46):**  background with school.  And so did it help?  That's a pretty loaded question.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:04:52):**  So I actually dropped out of high school when I was 15.  And yeah, and then came back and my whole college career was basically going not to  learn partially, but partially because in this day and age with the way our society  
**[0:05:06-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:05:06):**  is run, you can oftentimes get a lot further if you've got that degree.  So and that was the sole driver behind getting my master's was the course qualifications  to get higher up in the forest service.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:05:19):**  And so, yes, it helped in those ways, but I think for me, throughout my life, the thing  that has really led me down some great career paths and got me further is not so much the  schooling but more the networking and mentors and taking opportunities as they come along.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:05:38):**  So it helps.  I have a lot of good knowledge as far as the range management goes, and that certainly  helps with the career that I'm going down, but it's kind of a mixed bag as far as how  
**[0:05:50-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:05:50):**  much school helps.  Right.  So would you say the networking was really the key to your success with getting your  
**[0:06:03-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:06:03):**  master's for the forest service?  Yeah.  And networking has been the key to my success in all of my careers, I think.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:06:16):**  Ever since I was really young, like I said, my first careers was in the dog world, the  professional dog world.  And even back, I started working for other people when I was 10 and then broke away completely  
**[0:06:27-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:06:27):**  when I was 15.  And that was all through networking opportunities.  And as far as the range management and the starting my own livestock enterprise and prescriptive  
**[0:06:40-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:06:40):**  grazing business, that has almost been 100% opportunities that arise through the people  that you meet along the way.  That was huge.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:06:53):**  When did you first become passionate about this field that you're in now with the prescriptive  grazing?  Can you peg down a time that you just had the aha moment and was like, this is what  
**[0:07:03-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:07:03):**  I want to do and this motivates me by getting up in the morning to do this?  Yeah.  The aha moment, I think, if we're just going to talk about just the prescriptive or the  
**[0:07:17-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:07:17):**  targeted grazing, it happened while I was getting my master's.  At that time, I had already been working in the ranching world and doing the range management.  And the aha moment came during a course when they did an interview or presented a video  
**[0:07:38-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:07:38):**  with another targeted grazer out in California.  And at that point, I already knew that I wanted to be in agriculture, but was also down the  range management line.  
**[0:07:50-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:07:50):**  But what I realized that aha moment was this, why aren't more people doing this and getting  paid to graze and also have the production side of things going on, especially here in  southwestern Colorado, where there's a need for it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:08:06):**  We have a lot of shrub dominated communities that have taken a disturbance.  And we've taken disturbance out of the picture in the form of wildfires.  And so it's really it was a needed thing.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:08:20):**  And so that was probably the aha moment.  And then, of course, it got pushed to the back of my mind for many years before I actually  decided to pull the trigger and do it.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:08:29):**  But that was probably the aha moment, I think.  Right.  What do you think was the hesitancy behind putting it off?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:08:37):**  Well, you know, at that point, I just still saw my path being in range management through  the federal government or through private consulting.  And part of that is because I'm really passionate about the land and agriculture and the communities  
**[0:08:54-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:08:54):**  and the socioeconomics and all of that stuff that comes with it.  And I am fortunate enough to be able to have the trust of both sides, if you will.  So you have you know, you've got the more environmental academia minded folks, and then  
**[0:09:10-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:10):**  you've got the ranchers themselves.  And I've got a great relationship with both sides.  And so that's a big part of where my passion lies with bridging that gap between the two  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:20):**  so we can actually get something done out in these big range lands of the western United  States.  And so that was part of it is that was a passion I wanted to follow.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:30):**  And then it's the getting started in agriculture is really hard and figuring out how to do  that when you're not born into it, or very into it or whatever, you know?  Yes, 100%.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:41):**  I 100% understand that.  Mm hmm.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:45):**  And so, you know, I just kind of kept pushing it off.  And it's when I started managing that other ranch in Mancos, I left the Forest Service,  there was a pretty big carrot that got dangled in front of my face as far as pay and all  
**[0:09:59-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:09:59):**  that stuff goes.  And so I left and the Forest Service and it took me out of my range, which I wasn't particularly  fond of, you know, I like working in at a landscape scale and doing big country stuff.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:10:12):**  And so that when it actually boiled down to it, it still is really intimidating to start  without having the capital and a plan and the land and the animals and all that sort  of stuff.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:10:26):**  But then when it really boiled down to it, that's what I wanted to do.  Right.  And I wanted to have some ownership and everything.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:10:31):**  And so, perfect.  So can we so you talked about how you have trust with the environmental side of Colorado  and also with the ranchers.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:10:43):**  Can we talk about the Paws Act and what you think about that and any information that  you you've found from that?  Well, before we get into that, I do want to say it's going to be probably a month before  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:10:57):**  this episode comes out.  OK.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:01):**  And, you know, the thing is, is I don't really know that I want to speak to that right now  because I don't know enough about it.  That's fair enough.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:08):**  Yeah.  I don't know enough that it's probably such hot topic debate right now.  Right.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:14):**  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  And unfortunately, I'm bogged down with Whitby as Brian understands.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:19):**  So I'm not up to date on that.  OK.  Well, it's the start of the growing season.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:24):**  So it's kind of natural to get wrapped up in a bunch of Whitby work this time of year.  I'm looking at it, too.  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:32):**  OK, so then I will digress.  So I have a question.  If you could give advice to your 16-year-old self, what would it be?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:40):**  Oh, wow.  Knowing what you know now.  Right.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:44):**  I know it's a loaded question.  Yeah.  If I could give advice to my 16-year-old self.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:11:56):**  I think my advice would be to seize the opportunities as they come, regardless of what it takes  to get there.  And don't be discouraged if you fail along the way.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:12:17):**  And also, I think one of the biggest things is, to my 16-year-old self, is you may think  you know what you want to do, but you have no idea what life is going to bring 10, 15,  20 years down the line.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:12:30):**  You have no idea.  Things change a lot.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:12:33):**  So I think that would be.  I have to say that as far as my 16-year-old self, I think I did a lot of those things  pretty well.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:12:42):**  But I wouldn't go back and change anything.  But what I would do is, I wouldn't change anything, but I didn't know exactly what I  wanted to be doing, but I sure thought I did.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:12:56):**  So if someone could have told me that.  If they would have told me what I'm doing now, I would have never believed them.  Right.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:13:03):**  I get that too.  So the follow-up question to that is, what would you go tell a 16-year-old today that  wants to kind of head the direction that you're at?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:13:13):**  Well, it's funny you should ask that because we actually take on some interns from our  alternative high school here in Cortez in the summertime.  And our intern last year was a very responsible driven 16-year-old girl.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:13:32):**  I think that was the advice that I gave her because she thinks she knows the path that  she's on.  And I think it's a good.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:13:38):**  But what I told her is that she's, you know, you don't know until you know.  So keep your options open.  Keep your options open and your mind open and just follow the path that gets presented.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:13:52):**  And if you take a wrong turn, you can redirect when you get there.  What's an example of a mistake or failure that you experienced?  And what did you learn from it?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:14:09):**  Now that we're talking about mentoring the youth, maybe that would help too.  Yeah.  A mistake that I made where I would do something differently.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:14:24):**  Just something that you learned from.  Like you said, you know, don't be afraid of failure, I think is a huge thing.  And I think almost it's paralyzing for people to think of the failure so they don't even  
**[0:14:33-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:14:33):**  try these things that they're passionate about.  Yeah, that's.  You know, I have a hard time putting together an answer for that as far as a mistake.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:14:49):**  Because that's, you know, that's not a mistake.  You're right.  I shouldn't have said that.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:14:53):**  So maybe just something that was an experience that didn't go the way you wanted it to, but  you learned how to be resilient through it.  Okay.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:15:01):**  Yeah, that one I can definitely do.  Yeah.  So, um, actually the rant I managed in Mancos at times felt like possibly a poor decision.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:15:14):**  And that I had stepped away from, you know, I thought I was getting into something that  didn't turn out to be quite what it was.  And so the, you know, as far as that goes, you just take the situation that you're in  
**[0:15:27-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:15:27):**  and realize that it's not a problem and it wasn't a mistake, it's just a situation.  And you learn what you can from the situation and then, you know, you find a way to move  on and what's going to work better.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:15:39):**  In that particular situation, it ended up being more of an absentee landowner, weird  family dynamic sort of a situation, very much not what I wanted to be doing.  However, my boss and the owner was a very generous, extremely successful businessman.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:15:59):**  And so what I learned about business in that situation was something that I wouldn't have  learned anywhere else along the way.  And so you take, you know, whatever you can from a situation like that and it, you know,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:16:10):**  and realize that it's going to take you on the path that you need to be on.  And if it wasn't for that situation, I wouldn't have left the forest service and I wouldn't  be doing what I'm doing now.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:16:19):**  So right.  So tell me more about what you're doing now.  So I know, I know you do the prescriptive grazing.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:16:28):**  What's your team like?  What's your like day to day look like when you're in the busiest time of the season?  Okay.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:16:36):**  So our prescriptive grazing business, it's called ARCS Grazing Services.  And the vision for it is to work at a landscape scale to bring some change about and restoring  some of the rangelands in the area.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:16:52):**  And also, you know, that's through weed mitigation or, you know, wildlife habitat improvement  or improving the range for the cattle or any of that sort of stuff.  So we, you know, our vision is to work at a landscape scale.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:17:04):**  And so we run about 500 nanny goats.  And that growing will probably try to get it up to about 800, which is what a herder  can handle by themselves.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:17:17):**  And day to day peak season, we because it's also so it's a prescriptive grazing business,  but production is the other half of my enterprise.  And so the production side of the meat goats is very important.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:17:31):**  So we run a Spanish herd, all very low input.  We're working on getting them range adapted for our area.  And so in the wintertime, I'll just go through kind of the whole operation, I guess.  
**[0:17:46-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:17:46):**  So we're a transient herd that's I live down here in southwestern Colorado, we have great  opportunities to have awesome summer range up in the high country and then go down into  the canyons and the deserts of southeastern Utah, northeastern, our northwestern Arizona,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:18:05):**  or northeastern Yeah, and then New Mexico.  And so we just came off of our winter range in northeastern New Mexico.  So we go down there for about four months, five months out of the year on the winter  
**[0:18:19-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:18:19):**  range there.  We also have a Western SARE project that we're working on down there.  And so we take the goats down there, including myself, and now a herder, we hired a herder  
**[0:18:30-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:18:30):**  from Chile at in January before that I was doing all of the herding day to day.  And then in the summertime, we come back up here and do a little bit of we have a base  property in the Yellow Jacket area where we land during kidding season.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:18:46):**  And then we take the goats on the projects.  These are usually larger projects.  So we have projects in southeastern Utah, southwestern call in southwestern Colorado  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:18:55):**  during the summertime, and we'll probably work into expanding into Arizona for winter  range.  So that's kind of what our whole year looks like.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:19:03):**  And when we're out with the goats, whether we're on a targeted grazing project, or just  running on our winter range down in New Mexico, it's very similar to open range sheep operations.  And so we do active herding, we herd the goats during the daytime on horseback using dogs,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:19:22):**  and then everybody goes into what's called a goat camp at night where the goats are kept  behind electric fence for predation reasons and things like that.  And so that's kind of what our day to day looks like.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:19:33):**  And then there's a little bit of variance, like I said, depending on whether we're just  operating on winter range, like where we're looking for just an overall multi species  grazing impact, like down in New Mexico, or in the summertime when we're actually trying  
**[0:19:49-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:19:49):**  to target a particular species and use the goats more as a tool.  Right.  So you mentioned that you were the primary herder last year before this Chilean herder  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:03):**  came.  Did I say that right?  I probably said it wrong.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:06):**  Yeah.  Thank you.  So how long was it because of COVID or other constraints?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:13):**  Partially so it's been, it's partially, a little bit was due to COVID.  So it was harder to get herders up here during the pandemic because of especially from Peru,  which is generally where they come from.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:27):**  Okay.  Yeah.  And so they, you know, they have very strict policies down there and closed borders, and  
**[0:20:33-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:33):**  it was hard for folks to even get transport to the airport.  And so that was part of it.  But the other part of it is just simply because I'm a startup operation with really no capital  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:45):**  backing or any of that stuff.  You know, I'm starting completely from scratch.  And so I couldn't afford to hire an employee, an employee last year.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:20:55):**  And so that was probably actually the primary reason is I just needed to do it myself because  of the costs.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah.  I had an experience with a rancher in Nebraska who has a Peruvian herder and they loved living  with the herd and doing that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:12):**  Like that was just a part of their culture is to be a full-time herder living with them  and being fine with that.  And it also provided for them.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:20):**  I remember after one season of working with them and they went back, they said they were  able to pay for all of their floors in their house.  They didn't have any floors, which I thought was crazy.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:30):**  So it's just, you have to realize people live differently than us.  And for me, that was a huge insight that I didn't realize that a lot of herders were  able to do.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:39):**  So COVID prevented them from hiring him back.  So it's just, it's interesting to see all the effects of COVID.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:21:49):**  Well, it's kind of an interesting paradigm there.  You know, you take somebody, you know, an American kid and you say, Hey, I want you  to go live up at goat camp in a tent and herd goats for six months.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:22:03):**  And he's going to be like, no, but you can get a Peruvian or Chilean that is just absolutely  wants to do the work.  So question that's on my mind is, you know, you said you have a Chilean and you've had  
**[0:22:20-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:22:20):**  Peruvians in the past.  Why are the best herders Peruvian?  I actually haven't had Peruvians in the past, but that's what most of these sheep sheep  
**[0:22:29-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:22:29):**  folks use.  I, you know, I don't know exactly why, probably partially because there's you know, they do  do a little bit more of the pastoral herding there.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:22:41):**  And so they have some of the experience.  That's where the, you know, back historically.  So it would have been earlier 1900s.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:22:51):**  They would have, it would have been the bass that they hired.  And so it just kind of almost seems like wherever they can get folks that want to do the work,  as you mentioned, and have a little bit of experience is where they're drawing them for  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:23:04):**  and something where it's a little bit more, you know, culturally, it's just part of what  they do.  And so I think that's probably why they draw from Peru.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:23:12):**  And I would have drawn an employee from Peru also, but this particular herder, his name's  Martin, he ended up finding me through a holistic management international Facebook page, and  recommendation from a friend that knew I was looking for a herder.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:23:27):**  And so he was a very unique candidate for the position and perfect for what I needed.  And so that's why he came from Chile, but otherwise, I probably would have drawn out  of Peru.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:23:38):**  Right.  All right, so we have these goats who do really well on this marginal land, and I'm doing  air quotes, because it's not really marginal land, it's just hard to access, right?  
**[0:23:51-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:23:51):**  So I think, you know, just working with the probably the general public and everyone else  who sees what you're doing, is there something that is commonly misunderstood with the work  that you're doing with the public's perception?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:24:04):**  Well, um, the public for me so far has mostly been ranchers, really, that's who my main  clientele is.  The challenge?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:24:15):**  Mm hmm.  And so I'm not sure if it's necessarily a misconception.  Well, there is some misconceptions, there's been a little bit of the goats aren't magic,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:24:26):**  you know, so even fellow livestock producers, they still have, you know, most of these are  pretty large cattle ranches that have been in operation for a long, long time.  And so they very much have a great understanding of livestock in general, but they still have  
**[0:24:42-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:24:42):**  an idea in their head that the goats are going to come in and like just only eat the shrubs,  right?  Only forage on the grass.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:24:51):**  The goats are going to eat all of my pretty trees.  Yes, yeah.  So it's, so I think that's probably one of the big misconceptions that I'm finding myself  
**[0:25:03-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:25:03):**  running into, because really what it is, is it's controlled overgrazing and to get the  amount of treatment that you actually need to have an effect, you're looking at a defoliation  of 80 to 90% from these shrubs.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:25:18):**  And as I mentioned, I can't control what else the goats put in their mouth as they graze.  So I think that's been one misconception and just like everywhere in the Intermountain  West, but particularly in the Southwest, we're experiencing extreme drought, and it's a multi-year  
**[0:25:36-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:25:36):**  at this point.  There's been a lot of balancing between making sure we're getting the effects that we need  to and not competing with cattle feed, because there is a little bit of that.  
**[0:25:50-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:25:50):**  So I think that's probably the main misconception.  Fortunately, I, you know, as I mentioned with networking and stuff, I just have had a lot  of really awesome people over my lifetime that have really believed in what I'm doing  
**[0:26:02-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:26:02):**  and that I operate with integrity and that I'm someone that they can trust.  And so I'm fortunate to have a lot of ranchers that while it's a little bit of a hard sale  for a rancher to pay somebody else to graze their livestock on their land, they do see  
**[0:26:20-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:26:20):**  the benefits of it and they can see how it could be used as a tool.  And so they're willing to try it and see what we can really get done.  And so that's been pretty, pretty amazing.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:26:32):**  So where can we find you if someone wants to reach out to you and find you for either  being a rancher who wants to hire you or just find you in general for the general public  so we can learn more about what you're doing?  
**[0:26:44-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:26:44):**  Well, you can find me, I'm on Facebook, Rx Grazing Services is the, and then I have a  website which is RxGrazingServices.com.  It's kind of in the preliminary stages and so we're, you know, it's not great.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:27:03):**  We're getting there.  But I think those would probably be the two easiest ways to get a hold of me.  And I don't have a ton of presence as far as social media goes and whatnot.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:27:13):**  I'm working on finding someone to try to handle that for me.  But I think those would probably be the best two places.  What is the biggest challenge facing you right now?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:27:25):**  The biggest challenge facing me right now.  There's several of them.  This is part of just I think getting, you know, for folks that are coming in and just  
**[0:27:39-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:27:39):**  trying to figure out how to do it, one of the hardest things is finding the capital,  the financing, to figure out how to keep yourself going while you get everything else lined  out because inevitably in the first couple of years of business, things are not, you  
**[0:27:53-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:27:53):**  can have a plan A, but then by the time you actually execute usually on plan M or something  like that.  And so, you know, finding the financing to keep yourself going while everything else  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:28:05):**  gets lined out, that's a major challenge.  You can do, there's a lot of creative things you can do.  There's a lot of grants out there.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:28:13):**  And of course, FSA is a good tool if you're young and fit into the minority groups and  all that sort of stuff.  And so that's one major challenge.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:28:24):**  You know, the drought is a challenge in a unique way for me.  It's not as hard for me to find leases, quote unquote, you know, as far as prescriptive  grazing paying projects, that can be more challenging.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:28:39):**  But finding somewhere to take the goats is not particularly hard just because there's  a lot of the country around here that ranchers would love something to come eat the brush  anyway.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:28:50):**  And so that keeps us out of at least running out of feed.  But as I mentioned, a few things that have come up from drought in a different perspective.  For example, last year, one of the contracts we had lined out burned in a wildfire.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:29:05):**  So and that's directly can be attributed to fuel loads and drought conditions.  Another contract we had lined out for the spring that will probably end up starting  in the fall was a budget issue because the drought is so bad out on their winter range  
**[0:29:20-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:29:20):**  that they're having to haul water to the cows and so that, you know, ate up the goat money.  And so there's just and then as I mentioned, the just the overall animal impact.  So it's, you know, I operate in very sensitive regions, you know, they're either super arid  
**[0:29:37-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:29:37):**  and brittle or arid and brittle and cold or they're high country where you're dealing  with a whole different, you know, short growing season and things like that.  And so managing this controlled overgrazing, basically what we're trying to do while also  
**[0:29:52-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:29:52):**  not having detrimental impacts to the land as we go.  That's that's a big challenge.  That's one of those where it's once again, you can you can read about the principles  
**[0:30:04-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:30:04):**  and you can try to put them into practice and have a plan.  But from an on the ground production standpoint, that's not always how it goes.  And so there's a lot of learning as we go and figuring out what the impacts are actually  
**[0:30:19-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:30:19):**  going to be.  And if they're, you know, frankly going to end up being detrimental or if there's something  where, you know, the Alan Savory principles and hoof impact and all that sort of stuff  
**[0:30:33-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:30:33):**  is it maybe it really is exactly what this arid land right to get the soils up and moving  again, you know, so that's a constant juggle.  And I think that's a constant juggle for all producers, especially in fragile environments.  
**[0:30:45-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:30:45):**  But it's particularly challenging when you're trying to over graze one particular species,  but then leave everything alone because we're in a extreme drought, you know, right.  So how do you start your drought planning?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:31:01):**  Do you have a pre approved plan that you do with your team so you know how to make decisions?  Yes, yeah, I do from a business standpoint, right.  So from a business standpoint, I do what a lot of other people do, which is, you know,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:31:20):**  just kind of plan on trigger dates.  And for when it's time to start D stocking based on the moisture that we've received  at that point, you know, what our monitoring results are and whatnot.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:31:32):**  But part of what's a lot different for me is that I do operate on so many different  land bases that it falls into partially a rainfall situation, a moisture situation.  So for example, the base property that I have up here in southwestern Colorado, that's where  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:31:52):**  we do more of a traditional drought plan, right.  So this is a paying lease for me.  It's my landing spot.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:31:58):**  It's about 3000 acres of old dry land farms that were replanted in the CRP about 20 years  ago.  And I do operate with another cattle producer.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:32:07):**  And so in that case, we are working on developing a drought plan, where we'll meet on April  first and look at our precip and what happened last year and then go through and, you know,  reduce our carrying capacity or whatever, and then carry that over to how I manage my  
**[0:32:22-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:32:22):**  herd.  The other, you know, as far as long term drought management with my other contracts, it's very  much up in the air, also based on rainfall, but there's always probably somewhere to go  
**[0:32:34-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:32:34):**  during the growing season.  And so that gives me a little bit more flexibility as far as how I manage my herd.  But one of the things we are going to start doing this year because the drought is inevitable,  
**[0:32:46-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:32:46):**  and it could have a big effect, especially on where we go for the winter, is working  on switching over some of our livestock that we, you know, the breeding herd, switching  some of that over to a higher turnover class of stock, class of goats.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:01):**  And so we're playing with some ideas with, you know, either running, like what would  be considered a stocker or yearling cattle in the form of a goat.  Okay, yeah.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:11):**  Or possibly, you know, getting some undervalued nannies and bringing them back around and  selling them on the direct market as sausage and things like that.  And so that's kind of how, from my standpoint as a business, I handle that.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:25):**  So there's a little bit of the traditional drought planning, but then there's other things  that we're trying to do.  Right.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:31):**  So I want to go down some rabbit trails.  Okay.  One of these rabbit trails I want to go down is kind of dancing around, we're talking about  
**[0:33:41-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:41):**  drought and your prescriptive grazing practices and fires been mentioned.  So let's talk about your goats and your services during a drought and fire mitigation in an  arid environment.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:33:56):**  And why that's important.  Okay.  So you know, as probably a lot of your listeners will be aware of, especially here in the Intermountain  
**[0:34:11-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:34:11):**  West, we have been suppressing fires for a long, long time.  And so the fuel loads have gotten way out of control in these Intermountain Range areas,  and also ecosystems that are dependent on fire, such as, you know, we have a lot of  
**[0:34:30-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:34:30):**  ponderosa pine forest here.  And one of the main species that we work on treating is called gamble oak.  And so gamble oak and ponderosa pine ecosystems are both fire adapted.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:34:42):**  In fact, most of the ecosystems around here, it was not in the Intermountain West, it was  less grazing was our disturbance regime as it would have been out on the central plains.  Fire was also a big part of that.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:34:54):**  But it was primarily fire here as the disturbance regimes, and we've totally screwed that up.  And so now we've gotten forests that are much too densely forested with shrubs and trees,  and then we end up having a lot of problems with ladder fuels that take fires up into  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:35:12):**  the crowns of forests, and then really just let them get rippin.  And that's where we're seeing these really devastating wildfires that we've seen across  the country.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:35:20):**  And so goats can be a great tool to go in there and especially reduce ladder fuels and  their own needs and reduce the density of some of these oak dominated ecosystems that  should actually shrub dominated in general, but oak just happens to be our main, main  
**[0:35:38-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:35:38):**  culprit and so they can go in there and thin these out, reduce the ladder fuels and do  it in a way that is quote unquote, environmentally friendly, and a little safer than that, like  controlled burns or mastication or herbicide or things like that.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:35:56):**  And so as well as they can, you know, when managed correctly, just like any management  intensive grazing system, they can help improve the soil health and you know, all that good  stuff.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:36:05):**  And so that's kind of where the goats come in and the importance of this.  They're also a great tool to use in the WUI area or the wildland urban interface because  there's not a lot of risk like there would be with a controlled burn as burning down  
**[0:36:21-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:36:21):**  somebody's houses and you know, or spraying herbicide too close.  However, with that said, because I am very much in the middle sort of a person that's  if there's extreme is not a word that I like on either side and talking about their, you  
**[0:36:38-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:36:38):**  know, quote unquote, environmentally friendly, they still have their impacts.  And they're actually the most effective if you especially an old growth stands if you  go into places with a different treatment before the goats come.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:36:51):**  So if you burn it, or you masticate it, those are usually the best options and then you  bring the goats back in for several seasons in a row.  And through the like I said, when I say controlled overgrazing also it's targeting the plants  
**[0:37:05-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:37:05):**  at the right time of year to really weaken the plant or the root system.  And that's usually in the springtime with these cold seasons just like it would have  been would be with grasses.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:37:15):**  And so you go in there and hit them when they're trying to use their carbohydrate reserves  to get their spring flush, their growth going on.  And so anyway, as far as fire goes, they're just a really neat tool where they can go  
**[0:37:26-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:37:26):**  a lot of places that fire and machines and herbicides can't over the long haul.  And so it's definitely and we've seen this in California.  Also you know, this is a big thing in California.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:37:38):**  And I think you guys are gonna talk to Brittany coldbush and she also does this out there.  So they're they've just been real really highly effective as a tool, an alternative tool to  some of the other stuff that we're using.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:37:54):**  Great stuff.  So Sarah, I'm actually from California.  So I went to school in Chico, California.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:01):**  So that's where that the paradise, the campfire was and all my friends, family homes burnt  down and I mean, there's just, you know, fire season is real and it's crazy how it's just  it seems to be a really gross mismanagement deal.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:17):**  And I think, you know, these goats and sheep can definitely help solve this problem.  But it's I think a lot of other beer red, bureaucratic red tape that they they're having  issues getting through.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:27):**  So I'm pretty excited for what you and coldbush are doing as well.  So  I think there's a lot of public perception issues out there too.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:37):**  And a lot of people, you know, I'll say it ranchers, there's a lot of ranchers that love  their cows, but thinking about sheep and goats is a completely, completely  It's almost like they're offended when I bring it up.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:51):**  Because, you know, I do consulting with ranchers and they're like, well, if you have brush  issue, like that's what goats are made for.  So go put them on like you're gonna just borrow someone's goats.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:38:59):**  I would never my neighbors would one of the guys was like, my neighbors would kill me  if they saw I had goats on my land.  And I'm like, well, I don't know how I'm going to solve your problem for you if you're not  
**[0:39:08-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:39:08):**  willing to at least think about it.  And then you start talking about, you know, over 100% you know, replacement rate, like  130, 140% is what a lot of guys get for a for a kid crop out of goats, you know, yeah,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:39:25):**  you know, a lot of guys are pretty happy to get 85 90% on cows.  I mean, you could almost double that with goats.  My brother loves droplets.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:39:34):**  So I was like, that's a pretty good kid crop.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:39:39):**  But you know, it's a very interesting thing now that you're bringing up the stigmatism  around it.  And so you know, as you're saying, Brian, you know, you're looking at 130% weaning rate.  
**[0:39:50-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:39:50):**  Now I will say that when you're running a range herd, you're not looking at anything  that's going to produce quite like that, because it's a larger lifestyle.  But you couple that with an extremely strong market that is seems to be more predictable  
**[0:40:04-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:40:04):**  than the cattle market, you know, if we're bringing, if we're just looking at pounds  produced per acre, and then you're looking at this time of year getting upwards of $3  a pound.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:40:15):**  In a lot of ways, it seems like a no brainer to me.  And then you couple that with in an area like where I'm at where there's, I mean, thousands  and thousands of acres that is underutilized, because it's just places the cows won't graze.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:40:33):**  So you can couple that with, you know, an abundance of feed that you already have out  there to support, you know, frankly, on some of these ranches I work on, they could have  upwards of 5000 goats, no problem.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:40:45):**  And so it seems in a lot of ways that it would be kind of a no brainer, but there's definitely  a cultural stigmatism around being a sheep rancher or a goat rancher.  Right.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:40:56):**  So I heard, you know, kind of a joke said once that because there's a lot of goats in  Texas, and that, you know, when you're running a ranch down in Texas, you keep your cows  in the pasture by the road.

**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:14):**  I'm going to see.  Yes, exactly.  The goats are paying for you guys to have cows like it's crazy.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:20):**  You know that but it's it's 100% a cultural divide.  It's like, come on.  Like, absolutely.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:25):**  I've had the best goat tacos in my life.  I love goats.  I love lamb.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:30):**  It tastes really good.  And you guys are making money like which is crazy.  Like that should be the driving metric right there.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:37):**  It should be.  And so I think some of it comes from, you know, to be a cowboy is to be cool.  That's, you know, beef has done a great job of really making, you know, being a cattle  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:50):**  rancher.  Right.  Yeah, right.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:41:53):**  Exactly.  And so that's, you know, you have to kind of swallow your pride in that area.  And then there's also a lot of logistical changes that you would have to make to a ranch  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:02):**  to actually run goats on it, which I think could be pretty intimidating.  You know, you have to have the herders and the dogs and the working facilities are different  and all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:11):**  But I really think it would be a good option for folks.  And then, you know, if we're going to go down a different rabbit hole, there's the whole  American, you know, meat palate, basically, where we're very beef centric chicken, pork  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:23):**  centric.  Well, can we talk about that the history behind that?  Why we don't eat lamb or goat?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:29):**  Is it because of the World War Two, right?  Um, I don't know for sure.  But yeah, I probably I mean, well, there was a you know, if you go back into and you start  
**[0:42:40-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:40):**  reading about that there was the really beef got big because they needed to package the  excess corn and it was easier to do that in a pound of beef and put it on a railroad car  to take it to Chicago.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:42:52):**  And so and then you start so it's it's a really interesting convoluted history.  The other thing I think with sheep at least is the wool market taped at some point with  synthetic synthetic fibers.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah.  And so that really because before that everybody had sheep.  That's all most of these cattle ranches, especially where I'm from, there was a lot of sheep in  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:12):**  this country.  And almost nobody has them anymore.  And so, you know, I think there's a lot of I think there was just basically a lot of  
**[0:43:20-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:20):**  great marketing that happened to cover up some other some other mistakes that we were  making as far as subsidies and stuff in the in the farming world.  And you know, it's pretty complicated.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:32):**  But it's now has just become a cultural thing where you say, it's like I made us goat chili.  Yesterday we worked goats and I made goat chili and I just didn't tell anybody what  was in it until after they ate it.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:44):**  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that you know, they're pretty open to what they eat.  They eat all kinds of stuff.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:50):**  That was the best chili I ever had.  What was in there?  Exactly right.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:56):**  It tastes just like beef.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it tastes just like beef.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:43:59):**  Yeah, it's very similar.  So that's another thing that I think we need to really challenge our society.  You know, the rest of its goat meat is the number one red meat produced worldwide because  
**[0:44:11-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:44:11):**  it's much more efficient.  It's affordable.  And so I think it's just kind of a paradigm shift that the whole country needs to make  
**[0:44:18-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:44:18):**  as far as let's try a little bit something different.  Yeah.  So we raised some lambs at my husband's family farm and we actually had people who came and  
**[0:44:29-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:44:29):**  picked up a lamb and slaughtered it on site and just put it in its trunk and went away.  But I mean, they'll buy the whole thing and take it.  They don't want you to gut it or anything.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:44:41):**  And I'm like, that's a pretty good deal.  So I feel like there's definitely an ethnic market where they really do love goat and  lamb and they're willing to pay you what you want for it.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:44:53):**  So I think that's a missed opportunity for some livestock people.  One of the fastest growing demographics in this country right now is Muslim Islam population.  And they like to eat goat, but it has to be slaughtered and processed in a special way.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:45:16):**  So that was what it was.  They did a prayer, it had to be facing.  I don't want to be disrespectful to the religion.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:45:22):**  I don't really know exactly what it was, but I knew there was a ceremony that went with  it and it was so interesting and it was like, okay, well see you later.  And they were fine with it.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:45:31):**  It was what they wanted and we fit that need.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:45:36):**  And that's, we're in a deficit as far as the amount of US goat meat that's produced.  We import a lot of it.  And so there's a lot of opportunity there.  
**[0:45:46-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:45:46):**  And you know, Brian, I agree that there's this ethnic side, but I definitely still want  to hit on that home that it's like, that's a great market, but like us white folk need  to get on board with this also because overall it's a really good option.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:03):**  Well, I think as far as like food security and growing things locally, like people who  have smaller land basis too, like that's more practical than trying to raise a 1200 pound  steer or whatever.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:16):**  So absolutely makes a lot more sense to feed trees to goats.  Oh yeah.  Christmas trees.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:23):**  Yeah.  It makes a lot more sense to feed trees to goats than it does the whole 17 loads of corn  to finish one load of cows.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:32):**  That's not a load of beef.  That's not a truckload of beef.  That is a truckload of cows on the hoof finished.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:38):**  It takes 17 truckloads of corn.  Yep.  But what's, you know, if we go back to that historic side, that's why they started doing  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:47):**  it that way.  It's a really good way, easier to send all that to a cow and let that package it, then  send all those bushels of corn on a railroad car.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:46:55):**  So, you know, and I really don't want to rag on the cattle ranchers, but, um, I definitely  think that there is a place for some people to open their minds a little bit and try,  try some of these other options.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:47:08):**  And I think it is happening.  You know, these, um, most of these folks, especially the cattle ranchers I am working  for have a little bit more of an open mind or they wouldn't have me out there in the  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:47:17):**  first place.  And I think it's just a matter of time before they start.  I mean, not trying to put myself out of business here because these are my clients, but you  
**[0:47:24-0:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:47:24):**  know, like where they start to consider possibly adding this enterprise to their ranch because  it just makes a lot of sense.  And, and even if that does, you know, uh, use up some of my business, I would rather  
**[0:47:35-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:47:35):**  see that happen and, um, you know, get a little bit better utilization and use of our, our  utilization of our range and improve health overall.  And then also, you know, really open up this market for other folks to help keep these  
**[0:47:51-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:47:51):**  ranches intact, you know, and going, because this is, it could be, especially in drought  years, you know, if you can't find grass for your cattle, um, and you've got a couple of  thousand goats that you've still got an intercrazer that is still going, that's could be the difference  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:04):**  between going out of business on a really bad year and not for a lot of these ranches.  Yeah, well, exactly.  Right.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:11):**  And so, so if you have drought planning, you usually you'll have a herd, you'll have your  B herd and you have your D herd, right?  So skipping C because I'm CK, so you're not gonna get rid of it.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:22):**  But the first herd to go is your D herd, right?  You're calling the low performers, the ones that are expendable.  So I mean, maybe that's, maybe that should be your cows guys, but maybe that's your goats,  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:33):**  right?  Maybe you're like, okay, let's get the goats gone and they're easy to find a new home.  Hopefully.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:40):**  Um, I think they could think of it in those contexts too, as I feel like a lot of these  issues are just human mind barriers and, and they just need to get over it.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:50):**  Paradigms are a really challenging thing.  I know.  And to challenge your paradigm, I mean, I'm full of them.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:48:57):**  I like hear myself saying paradigms that are just all self created almost every day.  So paradigm shifting, I think that's what most of us that are trying things different  or are kind of trying to that in necessity, at least for me, it was, you know, paradigm  
**[0:49:13-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:49:13):**  shifts and I don't come from a strict agriculture background.  So I have the flexibility in my mind to, to challenge, you know, it's a little easier  for me to challenge some of those paradigms.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:49:24):**  And then you couple that with the necessity of what needs to be done to actually get started.  And I think that's how we get folks like us and some of the other people you've had on  the podcast.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:49:37):**  So we're about halfway.  So what are some of the what are some of the good resources you use?  And where do you go to learn some of these paradigm challenging practices?  
**[0:49:47-0:50:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:49:47):**  Resources?  Okay, well, I'm gonna give a big shout out to Ranching for Profit, ranch management consultants,  if it was not for them, things have would have gone very differently for me.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:50:03):**  It's the folks that are involved in that and I'm not trying to sell their program.  That's not what I'm doing.  I'm not getting paid by RMC to get on here and say good things.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:50:12):**  But it's a really incredible, really incredible program as far as what they teach at the school.  And then networking, as I've mentioned before, is a huge part of getting started.  And there's lots of that.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:50:24):**  And there's just some really brilliant minds that you run into along the way through the  people that are involved in that.  So that's a major resource.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:50:32):**  podcasts, I, you know, I listened to quite a few podcasts.  Obviously, you're, you know, just anything that you can kind of search on the internet  can get you quite a ways.  
**[0:50:45-0:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:50:45):**  I think overall, though, as I mentioned, is really the people so there and that could  be anywhere from mentors to just folks that might be acquaintances that are also kind  of in the field because they have a lot to share.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:51:01):**  And one thing I found getting started just even when I really first started getting more  into ranching this applies and then also the goat business is finding people that are already  working in the field that you're in, and not being afraid to ask them questions and swallow  
**[0:51:22-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:51:22):**  your pride and you know, just figure out or go out there and let them know that you don't  really know what you're doing.  And you're willing to learn and you just get in there and you just do it and I'm fortunate  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:51:33):**  to be a pretty quick learner and I have a natural ability with the stockmanship stuff.  I've just always been that way.  And so that was super helpful.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:51:40):**  But when I really just wanted to first start getting into it, I just went and started finding  rangers and people that would let me ride with them.  And then as the goat things, and everything has has progressed, it's a lot of cold calling,  
**[0:51:53-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:51:53):**  people are meeting people at events, you know, ranching for profit events, or HMI events  and things like that.  And just talking to them and generally, especially if you're willing to set your ego aside, people  
**[0:52:04-0:52:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:52:04):**  really like to help.  And they really like to talk about their stories and what they've been through.  And you can learn a lot just doing that.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:52:13):**  So that that type of communication.  And so I really want to say that people have been my probably my best, my best resource  in person, you know, that's that sort of thing.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:52:23):**  That's there.  There's just some amazing people out there that are willing to help people get started.  So who's been your biggest supporter, mentor or role model over your career?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:52:45):**  I don't know that there's one person in particular.  Collective me.  I think it is collective.

**[0:53:02-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:53:02):**  It's a collective effort.  I've had some great bosses through the years.  I've worked with some great producers that have really, you know, given me some great  
**[0:53:13-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:53:13):**  opportunities.  And so I can't say I can say anyone in particular, except for possibly the, if we're going to  really get specific, it would be the RMC.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:53:24):**  That particular program, like I said, had a huge impact on what I'm doing.  I think that all three of us can agree that the school shall not be named as a tremendous  resource and, you know, we all we all recommend it.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:53:41):**  Yeah, I think it just it just connects you with people in different countries.  Like when he does that, see the assignment in the beginning and you don't get to really  choose where you sit.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:53:52):**  He chooses where you sit with what group.  I think that's like one of the most brilliant things he ever did, because I went with the  Pasture Map team and it was actually really refreshing not to have my boss sitting at  
**[0:54:03-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:03):**  the same table with me so that I could be more authentic in like what my needs are and  learning and then actually like showing up for these ranchers who honestly gave me a  lot of confidence.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:12):**  They're like, CK, you know a lot.  They're like, you know a lot.  Like why are you sharing it?  
**[0:54:17-0:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:17):**  And I was like, well, I don't know.  I just I feel like because I'm not actually ranching like every day like I am I am writing  a desk.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:24):**  I feel like I'm not valid, right?  So I think with that it just validates like yes, you can do this.  You can make a business plan and show metrics where you can improve and then also, you know,  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:37):**  you are held accountable for your action items once it's done.  So I thought that that was big too.  So yeah.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:43):**  Yeah, and I have to say, you know, I had always wanted to participate in the school even when  I was just strictly in the range management because I believe that in range management,  there is not a different, you know, you have to understand the production side of things  
**[0:54:59-0:55:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:54:59):**  to be a good range manager.  Otherwise you're just out there telling people how to manage the land and you have no idea  what it actually feels like to be a producer and deal with those sort of challenges.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:55:10):**  And so that was a big thing for me.  So, you know, I'd always wanted to go and so I wasn't even necessarily a, you know,  a rancher when I went but it's just a great thing overall for regard if you're in the  
**[0:55:23-0:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:55:23):**  ag world at all.  It's just an amazing, an amazing thing.  You know, actually, okay, so if we're going to go back there is one particular I'd like  
**[0:55:36-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:55:36):**  to, you know, give a shout out as far as someone that's been super influential to the Cornell  family in northeastern New Mexico.  They've been a huge part of getting me started in the ranching world and giving me some amazing  
**[0:55:48-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:55:48):**  opportunities and support through everything I've gone through.  My friend, her name is Emily Cornell, she's working on taking over the ranch down there  and she ranches with her dad and her mom in northeastern New Mexico and I met her during  
**[0:56:05-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:56:05):**  our undergrad here in Colorado, Fort Lewis College in Durango.  So I would say that that family has probably been one of my most important resources moving  forward.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:56:17):**  Those and the other awesome ranchers that I've met along the way.  Emily Cornell, actually, I actually have her name in my book as a potential future guest,  so maybe you could slide in a good word for us.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:56:31):**  Oh yeah, definitely.  Yep.  Okay, so I know we're getting close to the end, so I'm going to kind of reverse the tables  
**[0:56:40-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:56:40):**  on you, Sarah, if you could have any questions for Brian or myself, I think let us know what  you want to know from us.  What do I want to know from you guys?  
**[0:56:57-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:56:57):**  I think, well I'd like to say, first of all, I think this podcast is a really great idea.  I think you guys are doing a really neat thing here.  That's been one of the, like I said, talking to people and people will share their stories  
**[0:57:10-0:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:57:10):**  with you and stuff, but they have to, sometimes for them to be able to talk about what it  was like to get started and the wrecks that they've had along the way.  It's vulnerable.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:57:22):**  Yeah, it's a very vulnerable place and so I am always interested in people that are  going to go out there and find folks that are just getting started and talk about their  story and what it took to get started.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:57:35):**  And so this is a huge thing for me on this podcast.  There's a lot of the other ones we can talk about, the grazing principles and the practices  and all this sort of stuff, but when you're just getting started, having a resource where  
**[0:57:46-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:57:46):**  you can hear other people talk about how they got started and the wrecks they've experienced  along the way and all of that sort of stuff is huge.  So I just want to commend you guys for getting this podcast started.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:57:57):**  This is a big thing.  And I guess some of the questions I would have for you guys would be more, I think possibly  you guys should just do a podcast with each one of you individually and talk about your  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:10):**  stories.  Yep.  So Brian and I are going to do that this week because I realized that I'm very closed off  
**[0:58:16-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:16):**  and I need to share my story because it is a very unique story.  So I agree.  I think Tonya is going to be interviewing me later this week and we're going to, we're  
**[0:58:26-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:26):**  going to, we call them onion layers.  I've got a lot of layers.  We're going to peel off some of those onion layers so that, so one, people who are listening  
**[0:58:34-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:34):**  in can build some trust with me and understanding of where my background is from.  And I agree.  We definitely need to share where we've gotten started.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:44):**  Even if you know, like me, I'm not ranching, but I'm working with ranchers every day.  So it's exactly.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:52-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:58:52):**  And it's, you know, and same with you, Brian.  Cause part of it is to CK is it's just cause you're not a rancher doesn't, that doesn't  really mean anything.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:01):**  I know.  I don't know why I tell myself I do.  I tell myself that paradigm thing, like we said is like, but once I get one-on-one with  
**[0:59:09-0:59:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:09):**  a rancher, then they realize that like CK does, she knows a lot about a lot of different  things because of my experience being able to ride ranchers every day.  So it's, it's really fun.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:20):**  And I definitely, I appreciate the feedback too, as CK people want to know, they want  to know your story.  Yeah.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:28):**  Well, yeah.  And it takes, you know, it takes a whole, it takes a whole community, a whole group  of different types of people to accomplish any of the things that we're trying to accomplish  
**[0:59:38-0:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:38):**  in this quote unquote, regenerative grazing, you know, what we screwed up and right.  And all that sort of stuff.  And if people go into it thinking about, well, she's not a rancher, so she doesn't know,  
**[0:59:49-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=0:59:49):**  that's how we end up in the situations that we're in.  Like here, there's a lot of environmental animosity between the ranchers and environmentalists  in Southwestern Colorado and Southeastern Utah.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:00):**  Trees are good, cows are bad.  Right.  Exactly.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:06):**  And it's that sort of mentality that either side doesn't have any credibility because  they don't know what's going on.  It gets us in the position that we're getting, that we've gotten ourselves into.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:16):**  So it doesn't, that's why this podcast is great because it doesn't matter that you're  not a rancher.  We're building a bridge.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:22):**  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:25):**  Exactly.  So, you know, we're talking about, you know, the future and communicating and getting another  generation involved and excited about food production.  
**[1:00:39-1:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:00:39):**  And one of the things that's kind of on my mind is, can you see maybe how a high school  could design a program to start teaching kids to do kind of what you do with goats and maybe  with sheep and give them the tools to be able to develop that kind of enterprise?  
**[1:01:00-1:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:01:00):**  What would that look like?  High school level?  Or college level?  
**[1:01:08-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:01:08):**  Or college level?  You know, both the high school group that I work with here and then also Fort Lewis  College is trying to do a little bit more of this.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:01:18):**  But really, I think they need to offer possibly some internship programs to get people out  on the ground and or a course that's a little bit more focused on the hands on side of things.  And then the general, the economics and the finances and the things like that.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:01:39):**  So I guess what that would look like would be more day to day field time so that it kind  of gets rid of this romanticized idea of being in agriculture, which is, I believe, to be  a major problem right now.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:01:53):**  It's a, you know, country is cool.  And it's, you know, it's the cool thing to do to get into regenerative agriculture, but  nobody understands day to day how hard it actually is and how much work goes into it  
**[1:02:04-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:04):**  and how unromantic a lot of the work is, you know.  Like I was out till 10 o'clock last night helping a neighbor try to butcher out a heifer  that we had to put down because she's a calving issue, you know, and there's nothing, you  
**[1:02:18-1:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:18):**  know, like glorious about that.  That was nothing fun.  So I think it would have to do, you know, you'd have a lot more just monotonous day  
**[1:02:27-1:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:27):**  to day tasks so people could understand that.  So it'd have to be a field course at least 50% of the time.  And then I think the other part of the course would need to be the logistics of getting  
**[1:02:38-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:38):**  started and what it looks like to run a business and whether that's business or any business.  But this is unless you are a business or an economics or a finance major, they very conveniently  like fail to explain foreign language.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:52):**  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  And so that would be another major component of it is like, let's talk about the logistics  
**[1:02:58-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:02:58):**  and what it actually takes to get it going.  Awesome.  That's great stuff.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:03:06):**  So what's something about you that most people familiar with your work wouldn't know?  Most people familiar with my work, what they would not know.  Most people do not know the extent of my previous dog career and what it was exactly that I  
**[1:03:27-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:03:27):**  did.  And so my mom worked in the professional dog world.  And so I was kind of born into it.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:03:35):**  And it wasn't important to agriculture, but born into dogs.  And so, like I had mentioned before, I started working for other people and it was, it was  dog showing was mostly what I did.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:03:45):**  And that was the, the, the path that I took.  So most people don't know about that.  And I was, you know, I've always been a very driven person and not afraid to go after what  
**[1:03:54-1:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:03:54):**  it is I want to do, regardless of, you know, how much I'm not getting paid or whatever.  So most people don't know that I dropped out of high school and I was 15 to show dogs professionally  and did that for a long time and then continued in the dog world, running dog sleds and dog  
**[1:04:11-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:04:11):**  sled teams and things like that.  So I think a lot of people don't know about that previous side of, of what I've done with  my life.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:04:19):**  One of your neighbors is a good friend of mine, Dustin Stein.  And he tipped me off that you're a former dog sledder.  So let's talk about that a little bit because that's, that's something that probably I know  
**[1:04:34-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:04:34):**  CK, I know I don't have any experience with dogs sledding.  I've always wanted to do it as like a tourist activity.  Like I definitely would love to go hire someone and they just sled me around and, you know,  
**[1:04:45-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:04:45):**  have that magical experience that I, I envision in my mind.  But I, I definitely want to learn more like the, how difficult is it to, to train a team  of dogs to do that?  
**[1:04:54-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:04:54):**  Yeah.  And so that's, well, that's what I did.  CK was, it was for a touring company.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:05:01):**  It wasn't you know, like a, we were hauling cargo into the back country of Alaska.  Right.  And no, I also, I didn't, I didn't race.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:05:10):**  By the time I was, so I guided dog sleds and worked at the kennel and whatnot for about  10 years and sometimes I was just part time, but it's definitely, I, at that point I was  over the competition side of, of the dog world.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:05:25):**  So I never was interested.  So the dog, as far as the dog sledding goes, it's, well, that's a whole nother rabbit trail  of how all of that works, but it was a very interesting experience.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:05:42):**  And along with anything, it really teaches you a lot just about hard work and what it's  like to operate in really extreme environments and manage a lot of working animals.  And it's translated for me, actually all of my dog experience is translated into the ranching  
**[1:05:59-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:05:59):**  world quite nicely.  Um, or in the way that, um, first of all, you learn how to handle an animal and read  body language and do some training and all of that stuff.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:06:10):**  Yep.  That's huge.  And then the work ethic is probably the other major thing.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:06:16):**  It's um, when you're managing kennels of anywhere from 30 to a hundred dogs and you're taking  them on the road or you're running sleds in the back country and stuff, it's not a light  load.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:06:27):**  It's very similar to ranching where, you know, sometimes you're starting at three o'clock  in the morning and not going to bed until midnight and you're working in all kinds of  extreme environments and, and with lots of different types of clientele and things like  
**[1:06:38-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:06:38):**  that.  So the work ethic, um, the communication and then the actual animal handling itself, I  think is, it was a huge part of that could be crossed over into the agriculture world.  
**[1:06:51-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:06:51):**  Does that answer your question?  That's it.  Well, it truly, it truly does because, so I did guided tours on horseback in Sierra  
**[1:07:01-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:01):**  Nevada, Kings Canyon.  So I was at the dude string trail.  That was me.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:06):**  I was a Wrangler.  And so you do, you have to learn.  Um, to get up early in the mornings, I mean, I had to saddle like 40 horses every morning  
**[1:07:15-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:15):**  and then you're responsible for these animals, welfare and, and safety.  Uh, and also people who have never been on a horse before that cannot speak English.  Um, you have to try to teach them how to ride a horse, um, within the timeframe of a day  
**[1:07:30-1:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:30):**  ride.  And so it is, it is a lot of people skills and interacting with these animals that, you  know, there were some horses that you only put adults on and you definitely did not put  
**[1:07:40-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:40):**  kids on.  And so that would scare me because I'd have to be like paying attention to that horse's  behavior the whole time.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:46):**  If they were, you know, choking up on the reins or kicking them too much, that horse  is going to buck them off, but I didn't want to tell them that.  So it's definitely, I think, you know, these things that teach us to work really hard with  
**[1:07:57-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:07:57):**  animals, it does translate directly with how we represent the ranching world.  Yeah, absolutely.  And, uh, you know, to hit on that communication side of things with the public and people  
**[1:08:10-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:08:10):**  that have no idea about animals or what it takes to run these sort of operations and  things like that, that's, um, a skill that I think a lot of, um, folks, especially traditional  ranchers, you know, we all do what we do partially because, or at least for me, especially now  
**[1:08:26-1:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:08:26):**  it's I do what I do because I don't want to talk to people a lot of the times.  And so if you have been able to get away with that your whole life, then you're really lacking  some very important communication skills and, and to make any sort of a change in the world  
**[1:08:41-1:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:08:41):**  and, uh, you know, promote agriculture is the awesome tool that it can be.  You know, I couldn't go back and learn the communication skills I learned with dealing  with clients on dog sleds or clients at dog shows or clients on, you know, I also worked  
**[1:08:57-1:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:08:57):**  for, uh, the tourist railroad out of Durango, you know, all of that, if it wouldn't have  been for all those experiences, I would be having a much harder time communicating with,  you know, people anywhere from the ranchers, the environmentalist to clients that want  
**[1:09:11-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:09:11):**  to hire me to do some fire medication around their subdivision in Durango, you know?  And so that's a huge, a huge skill that was gained, um, having to do a different type  of, of career, especially with animals and the public.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:09:28):**  People management.  That is always the common theme is that's the huge, the biggest challenge is managing  people.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:09:34):**  I want to do a whole series of just get, get somebody like, uh, get Burke Tyker and get  Alan Crockett on and just talk about people and how to manage people and build a team.  Cause there's so many of us that just absolutely suck at that.  
**[1:09:54-1:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:09:54):**  Oh yeah.  And it's, you know, one thing I hear, I hear this tossed around all the time and I, how  old are, how old are you too?  
**[1:10:03-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:03):**  I'm 30.  Okay.  42.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:06):**  Okay.  So I'm, I'm 35 and um, so CK you're, you're, are technically a millennial.  I'm right on the cusp of generation.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:14):**  Oh I am.  And I hate it.  I freaking hate it.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:17):**  I hate being called millennial because I have the worth ethic.  I can work.  I know I do it.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:21):**  Exactly.  Well, and so as far as like, yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:26):**  And so as far as like talking about the people management, but it is, here's the thing with  the millennial is it gets thrown around as this dirty term, right?  Because there is a different driver in these upcoming generations.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:40):**  But for me, it doesn't necessarily equate to a bad thing all the time.  It's not anymore.  It's gotten better.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:46):**  Right?  Yeah.  Well, and it's, you know, it's a lot of it's personal.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:50):**  It's a PR if you want to work and you want to get somewhere, you're going to do it regardless  of what generation you come from.  And there's a lot that these millennials have to bring to the table.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:10:59):**  And so I think instead of just sitting around talking about their, you know, millennials,  this and that and the other, we just need to learn how to work with them to make a highly  effective team.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:11:09):**  And so it would be really interesting to, cause we're not going to change the pool we  have to hire from.  It's just going to continue.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:11:17):**  You know, this is who we're dealing with.  And so trying to get a little bit more of a focus on how do we work with this instead  of complaining about it would be a really interesting thing to hear someone like Burke  
**[1:11:29-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:11:29):**  Tiger talk about, you know,  I'll have to make that note.  Maybe have to make sure we ask him that question if he'll ever come on.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:11:38):**  So yeah.  Yeah.  So something that a friend asked me to ask you was how do you keep flexible and manage  
**[1:11:47-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:11:47):**  your back to back grades and contracts?  And I imagine the good people skills that we were just talking about from your experience  in the, in the dog sledding industry, I imagine that plays a pretty significant part in customer  
**[1:12:00-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:00):**  relations and keeping, keeping contracts in the pipeline.  So you have forage in front of your goats, right?  Right.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:07):**  Yep.  Yeah.  And as far as managing, you know, flexibility and back to back contracts, it is, it is challenging.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:14):**  I mean, all of this is logistically very challenging, but yeah.  The people skills has a lot to do with getting these things lined up and pushed through and  keeping people on board.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:27):**  Definitely.  So I guess, could you say that question again, Brian?  I don't feel like that's answering it.  
**[1:12:33-1:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:33):**  Well, I mean, how, what are some tips you have to be able to keep flexible and manage  your contracts and keep contracts in the pipeline?  So you always have somewhere for your goats to go, I guess is more of the context.  
**[1:12:46-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:12:46):**  Well, you know, we're working on double booking is part of the way that we will do that.  And then picking the ones that are going to work best for what we're doing.  If a con, you know, we have a contract and a deposit program that helps keep people on  
**[1:13:06-1:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:13:06):**  board, you know, barring there's of course, drought clauses in there and stuff.  And so that's one way to do it.  The double booking, the having other, you know, being flexible.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:13:14):**  So for instance, the ranch that we are supposed to do in May in southeastern Utah, it's a  nature Conservancy ranch, like I said, they canceled because of the calling water.  And so what we ended up doing was picking up some smaller contracts where we'll take  
**[1:13:29-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:13:29):**  less goats and they're more municipal subdivision type of contracts, which we're not really  into.  But you can always pick up extra things like that.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:13:38):**  So that's another way to cushion that and keep feed in front of the goats at all times.  And then also just having some, some overall backup plans as far as you know, people that  may not be able to for instance, there's a couple 1000 acres really close to my base  
**[1:13:56-1:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:13:56):**  property that we were not able to get funding to use the goat.  So a lot of these ranchers are using equip funds or wildlife grants, things like that  to pay for the goats.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:14:08):**  So we weren't able to do that.  However, he would love the goat treatment.  And so I just like use that couple 1000 acres as a backup plan.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:14:16):**  And so I have several of those where it may not be paying contracts, but we've always  got somewhere to go.  So you really just have to do the double booking and then have, you know, other people up your  
**[1:14:29-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:14:29):**  sleeve places to go if you need to go there.  That's pretty great advice.  And I wouldn't have thought of some of that.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:14:37):**  So we've been talking about your goats, but we've never we haven't talked about your goats.  So let's talk about your goats, what kind of breeds of goats you like and, and then  finish up with what is your position agreement for a goat?  
**[1:14:54-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:14:54):**  Okay, so the goats we have a primarily Spanish bred herd.  They are meat goats, but the Spanish breed is kind of a I hesitate to call them a heritage  breed because they don't have all the fluff as some of the other heritage breeds.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:15:10):**  But essentially, they were the goats that came over with the Spanish conquistadors,  just like a lot of the you know, the Creole cattle and things like that, and, and eventually  got loose and feral and then they went and captured them and started breeding them again.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:15:23):**  So they're pretty hardy type of a goat that you can make them unhardy pretty quick, depending  on how you run them.  But the goats that I have are primarily Spanish, one of the main criteria is they just need  
**[1:15:35-1:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:15:35):**  to wean a kid.  That's that's a big one.  So and they're also come from a, you know, genetically a very low input herd from Texas.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:15:45):**  And so, you know, no additional, definitely no substitute feeding.  I don't think these goats have ever seen hay until I got them.  Very little supplementation, they only deworm when they need to and everything is just set  
**[1:15:57-1:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:15:57):**  out in a big pasture and allowed the kid on their own.  And it's just their responsibility to make sure that they're bringing a kid when it's  time for weaning.  
**[1:16:05-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:05):**  So that's it kind of goes into a little bit of the criteria for the position agreement  for a goat to get a little bit more specific for what I'm needing.  It's been, it was very hard to find 500 head of nannies to buy that came from anywhere  
**[1:16:21-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:21):**  except for Texas.  And so our climate is very different.  And so we've been doing a lot of culling, whether that's through death accidentally,  
**[1:16:33-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:33):**  or just, you know, natural selection.  Right, right.  Exactly.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:38):**  Mother Nature gets to take hers too.  That's right.  And, and of course, you know, if we're going to talk about rec since I brought that up  
**[1:16:45-1:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:45):**  and people that don't talk about it a lot of learning curves and mismanagement on my  end, especially at the beginning, because goats are very different than dogs or cattle  or horses or whatever.  
**[1:16:56-1:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:16:56):**  So as far as my position agreement with the goats, they need to wean a kid.  They need to be what we would call either parasite resistant or resilient, based on,  you know, grazing management, sometimes they're put in a position where you really can't judge  
**[1:17:11-1:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:17:11):**  them for their parasite load if they're still if they're using the same pen every night  for a night pen.  But so we're you know, we're selecting for goats that and we use the fun matcha scoring  
**[1:17:22-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:17:22):**  for those small ruminant folks out there, you'll know what I'm talking about.  So that's a big thing.  We need a kid, the parasite resilient or resistant.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:17:32):**  You know, they have to be stockmanship is a big deal for us because we brought everywhere  we go, we don't have fences.  And so goats have to handle correctly.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:17:42):**  And and we do use low stress techniques, because when you're out there by yourself, anything  but low stress is not going to get this.  You're gonna Yeah, you're gonna lose animals and not be able to get them pinned and all  
**[1:17:54-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:17:54):**  that sort of stuff.  So they have to integrate into the herd well.  And so they can't be herd quitters, they have to, you know, their, their social dynamics  
**[1:18:04-1:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:18:04):**  between goats is pretty interesting.  And sometimes you'll get a ghost that just can't get along with anybody.  So they have to, they have to integrate into the herd.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:18:11):**  Well, they have to be respectful about fences.  And take really, you know, one of the main things is just really low input.  It's when you're starting from scratch, I don't have the money to be able to afford  
**[1:18:24-1:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:18:24):**  facilities or lots of substitutes or, you know, baby them along at all.  And so they just have to be able to get out there and survive and produce on what they're  given within reason, you know, I'm not going to put them on a targeted grazing project  
**[1:18:40-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:18:40):**  where they're not getting nutritionally adequate forage and ask them to perform well under  those conditions.  But I think I think that's the main thing low input still be able to produce and and  
**[1:18:52-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:18:52):**  handle nicely, that's the biggest stuff.  I think those could fit just about the position agreement for any animal on anybody's ranch.  Fertility should drive the bus and you should be looking for those, those low input animals  
**[1:19:08-1:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:19:08):**  that require the absolute minimum of intervention to stay alive.  So absolutely, it's, it really has been great today, Sarah, where can our listeners connect  with you?  
**[1:19:23-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:19:23):**  As I mentioned, probably Facebook, our X grazing services, we've got a page that's probably  the easiest way.  The website is our X grazing services.com.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:19:34):**  That's another another way and then just, you know, you could always email me at our  X grazing services at gmail.com.  I think those are probably the easiest ways without giving out my phone number on a podcast.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:19:49):**  That's great.  Did we leave anything on the table today, Sarah?  Oh, well, you know, there's always rabbit trails that could be faced.  
**[1:19:56-1:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:19:56):**  And I'm sure we can talk about other things.  But I think you, you covered it all pretty well.  And I sure do appreciate you reaching out to me and letting me be a guest on this podcast  
**[1:20:06-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:20:06):**  because I think it's a really great, great thing you guys are doing.  So I feel very, very flattered that you were a guest that you decided or I was a guest  you decided to bring on.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:20:16):**  Well, thanks for that, Sarah.  And you know, it's it's part of what CK and I really want to do is, yeah, you know, go  out and find your perspective.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:20:23):**  Yeah, go out and find these people that haven't had a voice that have a very unique story  that are doing something really interesting in the industry that's just so far outside  the normal, even those, you know, even the rest of us regenerative weirdos are kind of  
**[1:20:37-1:20:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:20:37):**  like, people pay you money to bring your goats in to graze their place.  You know, it's like the total backwards opposite of my model where people pay me to take care  of their cows, you know, right.  
**[1:20:50-1:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:20:50):**  So absolutely, it's a very interesting paradigm.  And we've got to get some of these stories.  cold, and you've got to get this information out there and get the next generation excited.  
**[1:21:03-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:03):**  Yes, because they need ways to get access.  And I think this is a route where they can easily figure not easily.  I don't say that without taking that away from all the work you've done.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:14):**  But I think it's an easier way to get access to becoming a land manager.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:22):**  And that's the biggest thing I think and this is what you guys are going to show people  is that you have to think outside of the box.  Absolutely weird.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:31):**  It just is what it is.  And that's whether you're an already established rancher, or you're someone that's trying to  get started, you really have to weigh all of your options and be willing to, to think  
**[1:21:42-1:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:42):**  outside of the box, even to the point, it's funny, I have a good friend here.  She's and it's, you know, she thinks outside of the box to the point of like, no one's  using the bar ditches.  
**[1:21:53-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:53):**  So why not put up some electric fence and put your horses along the bar ditch alongside  the pasture?  I mean, why not?  
**[1:21:59-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:21:59):**  So technically, I think that's legal.  Like it's, you know, the bar ditches a public commons.  And I think in just about all 50 states, you're allowed to, quote, drive livestock down a  
**[1:22:11-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:11):**  public right of way.  But that doesn't say how fast you have to drive them or how fast you have to move them.  There actually used to be a lady that made a living with cattle grazing them along the  
**[1:22:24-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:24):**  the roads around here.  This is probably 40 years ago.  But that's, I mean, that's how she fed her cattle all summer was just up and down the  
**[1:22:31-1:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:31):**  road.  Yeah, I've heard a story about about a gentleman that did that during a drought, you know,  in the 50s or 60s that you know, he was completely out of grass.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:39):**  So he just loaded up his camper and his horse and, and his cows and he just started touring  around the county and his cows made a pretty good living in the ditch.  Yep.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:49):**  And you know, you'd be amazed.  Sorry to keep dragging this out.  But you'd be amazed to the type of opportunities that come up when you're willing to think  
**[1:22:57-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:22:57):**  openly about that.  That was like last year.  You know, we came home earlier than we expected because of that fire.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:04):**  And so it's kind of one of those I knew I had base property and we could use that but  then there was a farmer just down the well way that had followed our, you know, rested  his fields and the lessee that he had that was had planted before backed out and so you  
**[1:23:19-1:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:19):**  know, the whole thing had just turned into pigweed and a rusted thistle.  I mean, that's all the way around.  There's tons of it.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:27):**  And they were gonna, you know, they were gonna disc it all so that they could plant it into  grass.  Well, in the meantime, he was like, Well, let's see what the goats do.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:35):**  And so that carried us for a month and a half just going down the road onto this this farm  field that was just super weedy.  And so it's like, if you are willing to try whatever is suggested, you'd be amazed to  
**[1:23:46-1:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:46):**  kind of opportunities to come along the way with an open line.  Your goats like those thistles?  They were a little old at that point, you know, they're a little lignified and they'll  
**[1:23:58-1:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:23:58):**  eat them when they're young, but they really enjoyed the pigweed was there.  They really enjoyed that pigweed.  I know cows really love pigweed or Palmer amaranth.  
**[1:24:08-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:08):**  Pigweed is some of the best cow feed you can find.  And I think a lot of guys just absolutely want to go kill it every time they see it.  And well, my thing is, if it makes poop, it's food.  
**[1:24:18-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:18):**  Right, exactly.  And there's and it's just kind of amazing how much you can find out there that maybe,  you know, you wouldn't think about it.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:26):**  It's a whole nother rabbit trail.  The weeds are probably there for a reason.  Yeah, just find a way to use utilize them, you know.  
**[1:24:33-1:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:33):**  Well, our friend, Macaulay Kincaid, you know, he goes out and he tests weeds on the same  day every year.  And you know, and what he says is it helps him figure out what his pastures are lacking  
**[1:24:48-1:24:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:48):**  in by what the weeds are bringing to the table.  Absolutely.  Yep.  
**[1:24:57-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:24:57):**  And that's, you know, plants can, the land can just tell us so much if you just slow  down and, and look at it a little bit and not just try to, especially where we're at,  you can't control these rangelands the way that people think that you could.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:25:11):**  And so you're better off going out and observing what they're doing.  And slowing down a little bit and letting the land talk to you a little bit about what's  going on, opposed to just going in there with a prescription, even though that's what my  
**[1:25:23-1:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:25:23):**  business is called, and just trying to implement it and expect great results, you know.  I think that's, that's a big deal is learning how to listen to the land.  And I don't, oh, it's, it's something that you can't teach.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:25:43):**  I don't think it's something you just, you have to learn yourself.  And it comes from a lot of time out, out on the land and season after season of observation  and seeing how the land responds to your management and your changes.  
**[1:25:57-1:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:25:57):**  Yep.  And listening to the old timers, you know, I have to give them, they may not be able  to tell you what the scientific name of the species is, but they've been on the land,  
**[1:26:09-1:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:26:09):**  especially a lot of them for many generations and have learned from the generations prior  and they very much see the changes and what's happening and, and don't get enough credit  actually for the improvements in their management that has come over the last 150 years since  
**[1:26:25-1:26:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:26:25):**  we realized what we were doing was not something that was sustainable, you know, that you can't  run 60,000 sheep on the deserts of southeastern Utah and not have a problem, you know.  So yeah, it comes from experience.  
**[1:26:36-1:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:26:36):**  I don't think it can be taught.  I feel that way about stockmanship too sometimes, you know, you, you can either see the, what  an animal is trying to tell you, you can't, and you can practice it your whole life.  
**[1:26:46-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:26:46):**  And if you don't have it, you don't have it.  And the land is kind of the same way.  And in both situations, a lot of that is just slowing down.  
**[1:26:52-1:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:26:52):**  You just got to slow down.  Just slow down and learn how to listen and learn how to look.  Right.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:00):**  Exactly.  I think that's the tagline for this episode.  As soon as you said that, I was like, this is what, this isn't what it is.  
**[1:27:10-1:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:10):**  So that I thought I read something down pretty good earlier, but, uh, we might have to change  that many multiple.  Yes.  
**[1:27:17-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:17):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:20):**  Well, I think we've just about covered everything, Sarah.  It's been great.  And we both thank you for the time today.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:26):**  Likewise.  Yep.  So with that, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap it up and I'm going to play some  
**[1:27:32-1:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:32):**  theme music here and, uh, and go ahead and roll us out.  Okay.  Thank you guys.  
**[1:27:38-1:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/10--Sarah-Bangert-Networking-is-the-Key-to-Success-evl303#t=1:27:38):**  Hey gang, thanks for riding with us today.

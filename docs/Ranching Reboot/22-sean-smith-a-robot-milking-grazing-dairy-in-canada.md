Today, CK and I have a really cool guest.  We're continuing our dairy series.  
**[0:00:53-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:00:53):**  We had some questions in the Ranching Reboot paddock about how do you transition to a grazing  dairy?  How do you dairy graze with robots?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:00):**  Well, hopefully today's guest with clan man jerseys will be able to answer a few of those  questions.  Please welcome to the show, Sean Smith.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:08):**  Sean, welcome to the show.  Hi, it's good to be here.  So we're trying to wrap our dairy series up.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:16):**  This will be episode five.  When CK and I first started talking about this, we talked about maybe doing one or two.  Well then that rolled to three and then she dug up last week's guest, Joe Tomondal.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:28):**  And I thought that was a tremendous episode about the dairy grazing apprenticeship.  There's definitely a need for that.  One of the questions that we got after episode 20 with Dan Ventiker, since he milks with  
**[0:01:41-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:41):**  robots, is how do you transition to grazing with robots?  If you want to milk.  And I really appreciate you stepping up in Ranching Reboot paddock, our Facebook group,  
**[0:01:52-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:01:52):**  and saying something that you'd been doing that.  And that's why we wanted to have you on the show to talk about your transition over the  last couple years.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:03):**  Going from whatever you were and getting to a grazing dairy that's milking with robots.  We built a new barn about three and a half years ago.  And when we built a barn, we made the decision to…  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:19):**  Where are you located?  Yeah, maybe I can give a quick just…  Forgot that part.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:26):**  Description of our farm.  Sorry.  So we are in Minidosa, Manitoba, which is kind of the western side of Manitoba.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:37):**  We milk about 55 to 60 cows on a single robot.  We have 560 acres.  And we use that just for forage and pasture production.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:51):**  And we run about 80 young stock and dry cows along with our milking herd on those acres  too.  Do you own those?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:02:59):**  Are they like on a custom-graze basis?  No, we own all the acres.  We don't rent out any at the moment or anything like that.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:03:08):**  We buy in some forage every year just to top us up.  But for the most part, we're converting more and more just over to pasture and buying  in more too.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:03:20):**  Yeah.  CK, thanks for jumping on the brakes there.  I kind of got ahead of myself.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:03:28):**  Let's talk about your cows.  Let's talk about your cows before we get back into the barn.  Yeah, so we're purebred Jersey cows.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:03:39):**  My grandparents, I think, bought the first ones in the 60s.  And now I'm third generation milking Jerseys.  We do like our genetics.  
**[0:03:49-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:03:49):**  That's another thing that we enjoy is we do like to show cows a bit as a hobby and then  yeah breed them and keep track of their genetics and their families and everything like that.  So that is another passion of ours.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:05):**  But we also, you know, the Jersey cow is pretty ideal for grazing.  They're made for that.  And they can tolerate the heat outside a lot better than some of the bigger breeds.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:17):**  How do they do in the cold up there?  They're pretty good.  Like they grow a lot of hair.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:23):**  They'll grow three inches of hair.  And oh, wow, they probably look super wooly then.  Yeah, no, they get pretty bushy.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:33):**  So yeah, like our basically, you know, even our calves, they're raised outside in the  winter.  So when they're little babies, we put jackets on them and stuff.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:42):**  But once they're two months old, they're just their hair.  And as long as you keep them sheltered and give them a break from the wind, they'll do  fine.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:04:53):**  So you stay on pasture most of the winter then?  Yep, yep.  Like basically everything about nine months and up is out feeding on pasture.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:05:03):**  And then they have access to a shed that they can come back to.  And some of our younger stock from about nine months till they're confirmed pregnant, basically  they get some energy supplement too.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:05:18):**  But yeah, they walk out.  It's about a quarter mile that they'll walk out to eat and then come back into the shed  to stay out of the wind.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:05:27):**  And then those three dormant months or non-grazing months, what do you do?  Do you just supplement feed?  Are they still lactating or are they dry?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah, so we milk all year round.  So it just depends on the cow because we're calving all year round.  So dry cows in the winter, they're just out on eating bales on pasture as well.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:05:52):**  And then in the summer months, they're just on pasture.  So we generally are grazing from end of May until sometime in November, our young stock  and dry cows.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:06:05):**  As Gary heard, it's a shorter grazing period unless we had a ton of rain and we can keep  the quality up.  But it's usually more like the end of May till maybe end of September, depending on  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:06:17):**  moisture.  This year might be even shorter because we're really dry.  Sounds like it's kind of an ongoing learning experience how to balance ration through the  
**[0:06:27-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:06:27):**  year between your dry cows and your young stock and making sure they're having enough  energy to keep production.  Yeah, and we did learn some things just about for our young stock, trying to get them bred  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:06:43):**  last fall.  We had a ton of stockpiled pasture and we're just letting them eat that.  And we weren't having pregnancies.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:06:52):**  We were having cystic ovaries and we weren't getting heifers pregnant.  And so between our vet and our nutritionalist, we kind of figured that they probably just  didn't have quite enough energy just eating stockpiled stuff.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:07:07):**  So this fall, we're either going to supplement them with bales or maybe even just start feeding  them a bit of extra grain in those later fall months to try to do that.  So now let's circle back around to where I tried to start and the new barn.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:07:29):**  So how long have you been milking with robots?  Was that the new barn three years ago?  Yeah, three and a half years ago.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:07:34):**  Yeah.  Okay.  What were you doing before then and why did you change?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:07:40):**  We were in a 44 cow tie stall.  So you guys have kind of covered that in some of your earlier dairy episodes, but basically  the cows are tied up in a stall and you bring the machine to them, put it on them.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:07:55):**  And so in that system, we would be same thing grazing just to get the cows out of the barn  because it's a lot reduced workload if the cows are outside.  And so we'd graze in the months that we could, and then usually we'd even feed bales outside  
**[0:08:12-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:08:12):**  in the fall back in that system to try to keep the cows out as long as possible until  freeze up.  And then they'd be in the barn all winter standing in the stall, which wasn't ideal  
**[0:08:23-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:08:23):**  for cow comfort and foot health.  It did all right, but eventually it got to the point where our barn was pretty old and  run down and the labor was getting pretty intensive.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:08:37):**  And so we had to make a decision of what to do and we decided that building a new barn  was the route we were going to go.  So we built a new barn and it's a single robot on a compost pack.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:08:52):**  So the cows, instead of like a big straw bed, we actually have a bed made of compost that  the cows live on.  And we use shavings in that and then their manure and urine and cultivate it twice a  
**[0:09:05-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:09:05):**  day to make a compost.  And the cows sleep on the compost and live on the compost.  How often do you change that or do you just take some out, put some in and not ever completely  
**[0:09:16-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:09:16):**  clean it?  Typically, it depends on the winter because the winter is when it really builds up, when  the moisture builds up in the barn.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:09:25):**  But typically we'll clean it out two or three times in a year and those will be generally  like November, January and then in the spring we'll clean most of it out again.  Okay.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:09:39):**  So what are you using the compost for?  Just putting it in the pile back out on the pasture?  Yeah, so we put it out beside the barn in long windrows so we can keep turning it and  
**[0:09:49-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:09:49):**  let it keep composting to lower the carbon and nitrogen ratio on it.  And yeah, then we use it as fertilizer and we also sell it to gardeners and people with  their lawns and stuff like that.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:03):**  And you don't have any problems with moisture building up in that compost pack and getting  moisture like mastitis on the teats?  Well, the interesting thing is it gets so hot, the compost, that it actually kills any  
**[0:10:17-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:17):**  bacteria that could cause those problems.  So every time we cultivate it you're adding oxygen.  Yeah, do you guys take temperatures of it?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:26):**  Like do you know what the degrees of it is?  Well, we did when we first started out in the barn just to try to have an idea and I  think it was like 160 Fahrenheit is what it went up to.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:41):**  Oh wow.  Yeah, it's like it's sometimes it's so hot you won't be able to hold your hand in there  that's for sure.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:48):**  So yeah, and so when we cultivate it, it adds oxygen and buries any fresh manure.  That's in the barn too?  Yeah, we cultivate it in the barn twice a day.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:10:59):**  Are you ever afraid of spontaneous combustion?  Isn't that a thing too?  Yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:11:05):**  I mean it's certainly a thing.  We had a barn burn down once.  If your green to brown ratio is off by enough and there's enough moisture, your compost  
**[0:11:19-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:11:19):**  pile can get awful warm and combust.  I really think it's 160, that's crazy.  Yeah, it gets really warm.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:11:27):**  Well, that's hot enough to sterilize your soil life.  We've learned that soil temperatures of 140 degrees will sterilize your soil.  So it'd be good sterile compost without a lot of bacteria in it then you go put it out  
**[0:11:42-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:11:42):**  on the pile outside and the good bacteria and good fungi start to get back in there.  Is that kind of what's going on?  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:11:51):**  I mean we probably don't have, I can't remember, we did do a fungal to bacteria ratio on it  and it's probably fairly high bacterial to fungal ratio.  Just because every time you turn it you are disturbing those fungi.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:12:08):**  But you do see mushrooms growing in it and stuff like that which is a good sign.  So there's some there.  Interesting.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:12:14):**  Okay, so let's go back to the new barn with the robot.  So yeah, do you want me to go over just how we make grazing work?  Yes, the floor is yours sir.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:12:25):**  Okay, so what we do is with the robot one of the key things is the visits per day that  you can get your cows to come through.  So you want your cows to come as many times as possible because in general if you milk  
**[0:12:43-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:12:43):**  your cows twice a day and then switch them to three times a day you'll get 15% more milk  from those cows just by switching them, not changing their ration or anything like that.  Just by the more they get milked the more they're going to give.

And so since the cow can only milk one cow every seven minutes you can't have your whole  
**[0:13:12-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:13:12):**  herd leave for half the day and then come back in because it will take hours for the  robot to catch up and you'll lose those visits per day.  So you have to have it that the cows are coming in and out.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:13:26):**  So what we do is we still feed PMR in the barn in the summertime but we just cut the  dry matter that we're feeding in the barn in half.  We cut the grain that we're feeding pretty much in half and then that way we can have  
**[0:13:42-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:13:42):**  kind of a bit of both.  The cows can be in there eating when it's especially like the peak of the day heat.  They're happy to be in there and eating and the robot's busy then and then we'll let them  
**[0:13:52-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:13:52):**  out twice a day too.  So right now my dad he's the one who generally does the morning shifts.  He'll go down there around 6 30 in the morning, feed out some PMR, cows get up, eat and then  
**[0:14:05-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:14:05):**  they really start going through the robot because they get up, get active.  And then at around 10 o'clock I'll generally go and give them a new piece of pasture.  So we have all our pastures around the barn broken up into small paddocks which then we  
**[0:14:19-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:14:19):**  strip graze with poly wire.  So I'll give them a new piece of pasture and I'll let the whole herd out then.  And they'll all come out and they'll graze for an hour and a half to two hours depending  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:14:32):**  on how hot it is.  And then when they come back into the barn they can't get back outside unless they go  through the robot.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:14:38):**  I'll close up a gate, they have to go through a robot.  And that keeps them forcing through the robot.  And then we'll feed PMR again midday and then come evening, same thing.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:14:55):**  I'll give them a new piece of grass, let the whole herd out and then once they come back  in from grazing at night they have to go through the robot.  And in the evening they really do because when it's nice in the evening they'll just  
**[0:15:06-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:15:06):**  keep cycling through the robot and go back outside to pasture.  So they've got lots of grazing overnight.  Interesting.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:15:16):**  Interesting.  So you're strip grazing, are you back fencing with lanes or are you just letting them have  a bigger area to come back so you don't have a trumped up lane?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:15:27):**  No, we do have lanes, well we do have some lanes and then sometimes we make temporary  lanes.  Because generally if we have a seven acre strip or paddock that if we start on the end  
**[0:15:48-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:15:48):**  closest to the barn every single time it's going to get overgrazed guaranteed.  So sometimes we'll actually just make a temporary lane all the way to the far end and start  at that end and bring it back as we go.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:15:59):**  And then that way the cows don't overgraz that close piece.  That makes sense.  That definitely makes sense.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:16:07):**  So about how far are they walking?  The barn's situated pretty close to the middle of the quarter section.  And so then yeah, the quarter mile would be close to the farthest.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:16:28):**  So that's not really that far.  No, no, it's a ten minute walk for them.  So the change to the robot was because your old barn was falling down.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:16:41):**  It was mostly a labor need.  So how is that, I want to hear some more about what changes you've seen in production since  you've been grazing with the robot milking.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:16:55):**  So we didn't see the huge boost in production that we kind of thought we were going to when  we switched to the robot.  But you do see a change switching from straight PMR to grazing.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:17:12):**  When we first switch over in the spring, usually our production stays the same.  Like right now we're at 25 kg average, which is 55 pounds.  And it stayed about that, but our butter fat drops because you're putting them on such  
**[0:17:28-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:17:28):**  lush grass that it just goes through them so quick.  They don't have time to process it and get as much butter fat out of it.  So we do ship less butter fat in the summer months, generally, until later in the season  
**[0:17:42-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:17:42):**  if they're eating a bit more mature stuff, it'll bounce back up.  Now my next question is, who's your customer?  That's one big difference between Canada and the US when it comes to dairy is we have  
**[0:18:00-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:18:00):**  a supply management system in Canada.  So it's a single marketing desk system.  And so we sell to the board, the board sells to the processors.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:18:13):**  Like our milk goes to Brandon, which is about 45 minutes away.  And it's a dairy land brand.  That's their plant, but we're selling to the board, not to dairy land.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:18:26):**  So it's not necessarily a direct on farm and it's not like an organic or grass fed label?  No, you can do those labels still in Canada.  Those are more like in the Ontario, Quebec and BC areas where there's more dairies because  
**[0:18:47-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:18:47):**  then they can have a plant just for that milk.  Whereas in Manitoba, I think we could go organic and get the premium, but I think we'll just  get put in with everyone else's milk.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:18:59):**  It wouldn't even make a difference just because there's not enough demand because of our population  to have a separate plant.  Well, it sounds like you guys have completely different food police rules.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:19:13):**  It's like the food police rules around milk are some of the most ridiculous rules that  are on the books.  So what, I guess on the, are on farm sales allowed in Canada?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:19:29):**  Can you do that?  Yep, yep.  You just need a processor license.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah.  And so then if you were going to say we want to like sell our own milk process and sell  our own milk or milk products, we would have to get a processor license.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:19:50):**  And then we would still sell to the milk board and then we'd just buy that milk straight  back.  And then...  
**[0:19:55-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:19:55):**  So it sounds a little pointless.  It's definitely makes it complicated for if you're doing stuff like this, but our milk  price is substantially higher than milk prices in the US.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:20:13):**  Like what we get paid at the farm gate because it's a supply management system.  We only produce the amount of milk that Canada needs.  We don't mind it then, right?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:20:24):**  We don't export.  We don't hardly import.  There's more and more imports coming in now just as trade deals, you know, got to give  
**[0:20:31-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:20:31):**  up something type thing.  But for the most part, it's like any milk that you get in Canada was produced in Canada  and we only produce enough for Canada.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:20:43):**  I can definitely see the logic.  I'm sure that somewhere out there, you know, a globalist is going to go, oh no, they need  to allow trade.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:20:51):**  Everybody should have Canada milk.  But there's definitely something to be said about making sure you can take care of your  own people first.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:00):**  Exactly.  Good security.  Yep.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:03):**  Yeah, definitely.  And yeah, it is a hot topic like any trade deal.  I mean, I know, you know, different countries, their trade negotiators are always trying  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:18):**  to...  Yeah.  I mean, wasn't there some scandal with milk in Canada?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:24):**  There was recently, yes, about palm oil in it.  Oh, is that what I was thinking?  But of course, I wouldn't say that.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:34):**  Yeah.  Putting palm oil in milk to raise the fat content.  Yeah, you feed it, people will feed it in their ration as a bypass.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:43):**  Palm oil is because they use slave labor to harvest it.  Is that what they use?  Yeah, there is some questionable labor ethics in Indonesia and the bulldozing rainforest  
**[0:21:59-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:21:59):**  in some cases.  I should say that is across the board.  There's some people who are advertising sustainable palm producers.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah, I think palm oil plantations over the last 10 years as a follow on effect, the renewable  fuel standard in the US has caused more rainforest destruction than anything else.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:22:26):**  So let's talk about you, Sean.  Let's talk about you.  You said you were third generation there, so you've been there a while.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:22:36):**  What's your education like and what made you decide to be a dairyman?  Yeah, I went to University of Manitoba and got a diploma in agriculture.  And then after that, I went to Australia and New Zealand for a year and got some experience  
**[0:22:55-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:22:55):**  on some dairy farms and a grain farm in Australia.  So that was good.  And after that, I've been at home for pretty close to 10 years now, been full time on the  
**[0:23:07-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:23:07):**  farm.  And I just always love my cows.  That's really how my passion first started was just absolutely love my cows and love  
**[0:23:19-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:23:19):**  showing them in 4H and then moving up into owning some of my own and showing them across  Western Canada and occasionally we'll send some down to Toronto.  But then, yeah, we've always had more of a, I don't know, what's the word, just more of  
**[0:23:42-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:23:42):**  a insight into trying to do things more naturally and work with nature.  And so that's part of the reason why we grazed.  And then my dad went to a holistic management conference, not the course, just a conference.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:00):**  And that really got him thinking there's a lot of different things we could do.  And I don't even know how we got into the regenerative ag.  We were probably doing a lot of stuff before we knew what it was.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:19):**  But certainly, we've just always thought that raising animals on pasture is the cheapest  way we can do it.  And that's what we do.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:28):**  And now it's just taken on a whole new level.  You guys know how it is.  Once you get into it, you just want to keep trying everything and pushing everything.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:37):**  It's just like a whole other set of rabbit holes to chase.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:43):**  I'm surprised that you didn't, did you ever have a moment, like, I want to kind of do  my own thing.  I don't want to come back to the day.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:24:53):**  I think that's common with some other generational operations is they struggle with the kids  not wanting to take over these kind of things.  Did I say that right, Brian?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:25:07):**  Succession.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know, and I can see it, you know, I can see where that's an issue.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:25:15):**  So what was that like for you?  Well, I've got three other siblings.  So I'm the only one who's come back.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:25:25):**  My younger sister definitely has interest in it, but she, and you know, who knows what  that might take or bring her back to the farm someday.  But yeah, for me, like it really was like that 4-H experience and getting into like  
**[0:25:39-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:25:39):**  a passion for livestock at a young age just got me so hooked.  And like even when I was younger, I hardly ever got off farm summer jobs or anything  like that because I just wanted to be on the farm.  
**[0:25:49-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:25:49):**  And when I was in university, I just dropped out because I'd rather just be out farming  type thing and you know, stuff like that.  I just knew that this is what I was going to do.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:02):**  Okay.  You said your dad was still around helping on the farm.  He got up and did morning chores.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:07):**  Did I remember that correctly?  Yeah.  So my dad is, me and him are the main laborers.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:16):**  So yeah, he's still around.  We're in the process of hiring someone else on right now just because we feel like we  got enough work for someone else.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:25):**  But yeah, he's still involved, heavily involved.  What were some of the discussions like with your family when you're deciding whether  or not to bring the robots in?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:35):**  Well, the cost is a big thing.  They're not a cheap thing to have and they're not a cheap way to produce milk.  They're expensive to maintain.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:26:50):**  But we definitely looked at it as a chance to be a bit more flexible in our lifestyle.  And my dad, you know, he had been milking in a Thai stall barn his whole life and it  had taken its toll on his body.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:27:10):**  And so that was something to look at too was if I'm going to farm my whole life, do I  want to be?  Yeah.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:27:19):**  And he was pretty open minded about it.  Was there a lot of pushback of like, no, let's just do the status quo?  No, no, he was pretty open minded about it.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:27:30):**  And then the other thing was just it's really hard to find good employees that stick around.  You can find good employees, but usually they end up maxing out on what you can pay them  and going and doing something else because they're good.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:27:46):**  So we just decided that this would probably cut out an employee by having a robot that  never misses a day or anything like that.  It's always here.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:27:57):**  Did you say what kind of a robot it is?  We're a D-Laval robot.  I'm not even going to ask the stupid question of how is that different from a Lely because  
**[0:28:09-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:28:09):**  you might not have ever seen a Lely and I wouldn't know what you were talking about  anyway.  Yeah, no, they both get the job done.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:28:18):**  I mean, it's like comparing a Dodge and a Ford, I think.  Probably just preference and you also got to take into account where your service is  because that's the day that you need people who are going to be around to help you when  
**[0:28:32-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:28:32):**  things go wrong.  I can only imagine how much stress it is when your robot goes down.  Yeah, it's bad if it lasts for hours because the cows get pretty upset and pretty uncomfortable.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:28:50):**  But we're pretty lucky.  Like the guys that we work with, they're actually quite a ways away from us.  So they'd much rather spend two hours with me on FaceTime explaining how to fix stuff  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:00):**  than drive out themselves.  So that's pretty nice.  I mean, it's actually when it's two in the morning when that happens.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:06):**  Do you have a backup plan if you can't get things done in a good time frame?  We got an individual milker so I guess if we absolutely had to we could milk.  That's your backup plan?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:21):**  Yeah.  Like go get the old bucket.  Get the bucket and stool.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:26):**  That wouldn't be very much fun for 50 cows three times a day.  No, no, it would definitely not be much fun.  But they're pretty good.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:37):**  We've never been down for more than a few hours so far.  So that's good.  That would be my biggest concern would be spare parts and supply chain availability  
**[0:29:47-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:47):**  for that because that's a pretty crucial part of your operation right now.  Yeah, everything comes from Sweden or Denmark too.  So yeah, definitely the supply chain.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:29:58):**  We haven't had a problem with COVID but there's some other stuff.  I mean if you're trying to get tractor parts or something from Europe right now, they'll  tell you it's a month or something like that.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:30:08):**  It just smiles everywhere.  So I had to look it up while we've been here on this interview of where Manitoba was  because I just couldn't quite remember where it was.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:30:21):**  As it turns out, you're pretty much straight north of North Dakota, correct?  Yes.  And you're more towards the Montana side than North Dakota side.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:30:30):**  So what are your winters like?  Yeah, they're pretty cold.  I can't remember off the top of my head what our frost-free days are but they're fairly  
**[0:30:44-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:30:44):**  short because we actually live up on a – they call it a mountain but it's really just  a hill.  But it's enough of a hill that our frost-free days are short.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:30:53):**  So our growing days are shorter and then winter – winter usually sets in.  In November, you start getting some snow and stuff generally and you're going to have  snow on the ground until middle of March.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:31:11):**  And yeah, there's definitely going to be guaranteed there's going to be days when  it's minus 35 Fahrenheit or Celsius.  I think it's about the same without temperature.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:31:22):**  It doesn't matter at that point, I don't think.  Yeah.  So there's days when it gets that cold.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:31:32):**  So sometimes you feed them a yard when it gets that cold and it's windy just so the  cows or the heifers don't have to walk out to the pasture.  But it does get cold.  
**[0:31:44-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:31:44):**  How much snow have you seen cows fight through to get to grass?  That's a good question.  Because we don't generally stockpile and then graze late, late in the year like that.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:32:00):**  But I do – it's funny, you can go out to a pasture and go to set up some bales for  them to graze and let them into there and they'll go dig through the snow and eat  the grass that's stockpiled in that pasture before they even touch the bales.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:32:16):**  So I've seen them do that.  And yeah, they'll dig down and find some green at the bottom and eat it.  But we don't generally push our cows quite as hard as maybe beef producers do to forage  
**[0:32:31-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:32:31):**  through the snow.  You have a different production metric that you've got to worry about than I do.  I can push it a little harder during the winter.  
**[0:32:44-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:32:44):**  It's – you know, wintering dairy cows on pasture, I can definitely see some issues  even as far south as I am.  And I think it's really great to talk to you because if you can do it in Canada, it  
**[0:33:02-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:33:02):**  can be done anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I mean, I've never talked to enough people who do it where they don't get a  
**[0:33:11-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:33:11):**  good freeze because I'm sure it wouldn't be very much fun being in mud.  Like if you're a place that it's wet but not absolutely frozen solid, the ground.  So I still think that once you get your soil's water holding capacity and all those traits  
**[0:33:31-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:33:31):**  built up and lots of root systems in, you probably would benefit or be able to do it  a lot better even if you're just wet, not necessarily frozen.  Yeah, some of those problems, the more you do it, the less it's going to be a problem.  
**[0:33:46-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:33:46):**  Yes, yeah.  So who have been some of your good mentors along the line that have helped you out?  Well, like we don't have, it's coming on like there's some good regenerative people  
**[0:34:09-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:34:09):**  around us.  But for the most part, like I spend hours a day listening to podcasts or audio books  while I'm working.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:34:19):**  So that certainly helps.  We've got a guy up in this area, Michael Teelius' name, and he was kind of the one who was really  preaching a regen egg to farmers early and now he actually works for Understanding Egg  
**[0:34:36-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:34:36):**  now and General Mills.  And so he's still a guy.  If I have a more in-depth question, I'll go to him and he's the one who can either  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:34:47):**  find the answers or know the answers type thing.  Those Understanding Egg guys are generally pretty sharp.  I know several of them.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:34:54):**  Yeah, and they also just have a great network that they can tap into.  Even if they don't know that answer, there are so many guys that they know that have  been doing it for so long.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:35:05):**  And smart guys.  So would you have any advice from where you are on how somebody could transition their  either freestyle or tie-stall barn or however they milk to a more grass-based operation?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:35:28):**  Generally, I think that people, in order to dip their toes in the water, I would say start  with your young stock.  Similar to what you guys were talking about with Honey Creek is that your young stock,  
**[0:35:47-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:35:47):**  you're not pushing for that performance as much because it doesn't show up on your milk  check.  And so there's less risk that way.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:00):**  And that's probably where I would start.  There's still a lot of people who, they'll tell me that they can't pasture their heifers  because their heifers get too skinny on pasture.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:10):**  But that's probably because they're tossing them out in one pasture and leaving them there  the whole summer.  And heifers eat it down to nothing and then don't have anything.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:18):**  Whereas us, our heifers get way too fat on pasture every year.  I can't show my heifers at a cattle show or a dairy show because they're so fat.  Good problem to have.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:30):**  So I'd say start with your young stock.  If you've only got one pasture, split that pasture in half and just wear the poly wire  to start with.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:41):**  Yeah, can you talk more about how you approach a pasture when you do grazing?  What is the basic principles of how you would go look at a pasture and decide, I think you  said seven acres, trips?  
**[0:36:58-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:36:58):**  Yeah, roughly.  So what factors go into that?  So with our dairy herd, with the dairy you're trying to always hit it when it's in its vegetative  
**[0:37:12-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:37:12):**  state, the plant.  So that means fast moves and only allowing the cow to take one bite each time they're  in that piece.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:37:28):**  You're never letting them back for a second bite.  So we'll generally go out there.  Pastures will be 12 to 18 inches and our pastures are grass mixed with different legumes.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:37:42):**  And yeah, the cows will take one bite, cut it down to about six inches and then we just  try to keep moving them ahead.  And sometimes if in the spring when it's big flush, that might mean going out and clipping  
**[0:37:55-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:37:55):**  some pastures to knock them back so that then you can go back in and hit them in a vegetative  state with the cows.  But then it's short rest periods for our dairy herd.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:38:05):**  It's only about 35 to 40 day rest periods because you're going back and hitting them  right away to keep them in that vegetative state.  So how do you figure out how much area to give them?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:38:20):**  I guess that's one of the hard questions that people don't often know to ask is how do you  figure out how small of an area you can give them for a duration?  That's definitely just experience and an eye for it because I generally just go by how  
**[0:38:43-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:38:43):**  much they've ate.  Like if they've ate it down way too short and I can tell they've gone back and taken  second bites on plants and stuff, I'm going to give them a bigger piece the next time.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:38:57):**  They're probably similar like…  And that's like the difference between seven and eight acres, right?  Yeah, well, so they're getting these seven, it's a 70 acre paddock, but they're probably  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:39:11):**  only getting half an acre each time I give them a break.  These 55 cows.  So each time I give them a new piece of pasture, yeah, they're just getting like half an  
**[0:39:19-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:39:19):**  acre each time.  So 55 cows on a half an acre is about 100,000 pounds an acre of stock density and you move  twice a day.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:39:31):**  I dig it.  And it's really, as we're going more in the regenerative route and trying to figure out  how to use less machinery and stuff, we've come to realize that if you're hitting them  
**[0:39:49-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:39:49):**  in that vegetative state all the time, your alfalfa is going to eventually start dying  out because it just never puts enough energy into their roots.  So some of those pieces like now, we'll give it a full season rest, let the alfalfa grow  
**[0:40:06-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:40:06):**  up, sice and real kvetch grow up and bloom and everything.  And then we'll go in the fall with our bred heifers and dry cows and just mob graze that,  eventually stop more than 50% down and then the next year, you notice a difference that  
**[0:40:22-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:40:22):**  it comes back even better those pastures.  And we're doing that instead of spraying it out, putting it into something else for a  couple years and then going back into pasture.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:40:38):**  The longer you've been grazing like that, are you noticing increases in production of  your ground?  Are you getting more forage per acre?  
**[0:40:47-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:40:47):**  Yeah, I don't know.  That's a good question.  We've never really even done like taking the dry matter off our pastures.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:41:00):**  I know some people are doing that, going out and taking samples and taking dry matter off  and stuff.  We don't do that.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:41:08):**  But I would say that one thing is the water holding capacity is something that is really  noticeable in those pastures that were hitting really frequently, but for a short amount  of time.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:41:26):**  Like the other day I was out there and it took over four and a half inches and under  15 minutes our dairy pastures.  So it's pretty impressive that way.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:41:39):**  What's the, compare that to something so we have a frame of reference for it.  So our hay fields, which we're taking two cuts of hay off every year and hopefully getting  cows on there to graze a third cut.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:41:53):**  I haven't done one for a full hour, but it was like 12 minutes for one inch our hay fields.  And then the second inch was like another 35 minutes.  And then like our neighbor, who is annual tillage wheat canola rotation, his first inch  
**[0:42:17-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:42:17):**  went in really quick on the top layer that was all tilled.  I went in in like three minutes, but his second inch sat on the surface for over seven hours.  So yeah, you can see the big difference that way when you're comparing even from our pastures  
**[0:42:34-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:42:34):**  to our hay fields and then to a neighbor who's full tillage.  And are you no tillage or are you still like minimum tillage?  We are no till.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:42:43):**  We bought a John Deere zero till drill last year and bit the bullet on the, they're expensive,  but we decided that's the route we want to go.  Okay.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:42:55):**  Any problems with weed control?  Yes.  So one thing that we haven't talked about is a lot of our, not a lot of our forage,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:43:05):**  but a good chunk of our forage is multi-species cover crops that we just cut for forage.  And so we used to always have Italian rye and clovers in those.  And so we'd usually cut it end of July, early August, and then graze the regrowth late in  
**[0:43:24-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:43:24):**  the year.  And we used to do that just every year, we'd graze it like October, November type thing.  But we've come to realize that without doing a fall spray for years and years in a row,  
**[0:43:43-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:43:43):**  that your dandelions can become very, very hard to kill.  And then for dandelions, you can knock them back slightly in the spring with a spray,  but you can't really kill them.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:43:55):**  So that's something we've come aware of.  And now we've almost switched to, we're not going to graze those pieces unless we can  get on there early, like we have a lot of rain.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:44:08):**  Just because, yeah, the dandelion situation was pretty bad.  So we'd rather graze pastures late in the year than graze these cover crops.  That makes sense.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:44:20):**  Yeah, I mean, sometimes I think that I just need to put my whole farm into perennials  and just manage them better.  But it's hard to do that when you can get a lot of tonnage off those cover crops and  
**[0:44:40-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:44:40):**  then a new hayfield just produces so much better for those first five years.  So it's hard to completely switch to that, to just perennials, but more and more we are  more of our acres are going into perennials.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:44:53):**  Do you think you'll need more acres of perennials to maintain the same number of cows?  Yeah, I don't.  I'm not sure.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:45:10):**  I mean, because we're buying in alfalfa pretty much every year anyways.  So it's tough to say because we're supplementing, like we're not producing everything on our  cover crops.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:45:21):**  But yeah, I'd say probably.  This year will be a good test because we haven't had much rain, but I still think our cover  crops are going to produce good.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:45:32):**  So it'll be a good test to see how much tonnage we get off of those in comparison to hay stands,  which you would think would use the rain really well because they're already established.  So any bit of rain they're going to suck up and use.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:45:45):**  But I think the cover crop is going to produce more this year than our hay stands.  So it'll be a good test this year.  You mentioned your rain.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:45:55):**  Are you a little short on rain?  You in a drought or are you okay?  Yeah, we are in a drought.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:01):**  We got lucky at the start of June.  We got a four inch rain in one day.  But that's about the only substantial amount of rain we've got all season, like since spring,  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:13):**  everything.  So we are really dry going into that.  And we got that and it was nice.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:18):**  It was good for the pastures.  Nice flush, but we haven't really had anything substantial other than maybe one tenth or  so a couple times.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:27):**  So yeah, now it's really dry.  Like digging down.  I was digging a hole to plant a tree today and the first four inches is pretty dry.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:35):**  So it's getting dry here right now.  We need to rain pretty bad.  Like our area in the last 35 days is under 40% of our annual moisture.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:49):**  Wow.  What would be your normal, what is a normal average year besides a random collection of  numbers and a setting on a dryer?  
**[0:46:58-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:46:58):**  Yeah, I don't know our annual rain off the top of my head to be honest.  So if I was going to guess I'd say maybe like 10 inches of precipitation in the growing  season.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:47:16):**  Like not crazy dry, like not North Dakota dry, but also not like Eastern Canada, Eastern  States wet either.  Yeah, not like Georgia or Florida wet.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:47:28):**  No.  I think there is a lot of irrigation.  CK you're barely with us today.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:47:42):**  She just moved to Idaho.  I can't imagine that, yeah, we just moved to Idaho so it might take a couple days to  get the internet ironed out.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:47:56):**  I think she was asking about irrigation.  Is that correct?  Yeah, we don't have irrigation.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:48:03):**  There's some places in Manitoba with sandier soil that they grow potatoes that do it.  I've certainly looked into it after having really sporadic rains these last few years  and our neighbors seem to be pretty happy to give us every drop of water that falls  
**[0:48:22-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:48:22):**  onto their land.  So if we built a dam we could have irrigation and so I've looked into it, especially for  our dairy herd because basically every day we're grazing, we're cutting our feed costs.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:48:38):**  Well, our difference between our feed costs and the cage use of butterfat we lose is 150  bucks more like in our pocket.  So if you could graze for an extra six weeks a year because you had irrigation that would  
**[0:48:51-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:48:51):**  add up pretty quick.  It wouldn't take too many years to pay for that dam.  I think I just heard on the radio yesterday that hay spot prices were around 250 to 300  
**[0:49:07-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:49:07):**  per ton for high quality alfalfa and even just basic grass hay, grass prairie hay was  still in the $150 a ton range.  And a ton of hay for reference, I figure that at 40 cow days.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:49:26):**  A bale of hay is 40 cow days.  So that $150 is going to feed 40 cows for a day or one cow for 40 days.  And every day you're out on pasture, that's a bale of hay you're not buying.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:49:42):**  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly how I look at it too.  Every day I can stretch our pasture, whether it's for our dairy herd or our young stock  
**[0:49:51-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:49:51):**  of dry cows.  It's a bale of hay we don't have to make or buy.  And I think that a lot of guys look at that hay equipment and go, well, I'll just go make  
**[0:50:04-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:50:04):**  my own hay.  Well, there's tractor depreciation, there's your time sitting in the seat, there's wear  and tear on the machinery, and there's a big diesel fuel bill at the end of the day.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:50:15):**  And very few guys, once they really drill down into their numbers, it's almost always  cheaper to buy it than it is to make it yourself.  Yeah, that's one thing that, like there's a few things that I think dairy farming has  
**[0:50:35-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:50:35):**  unique challenges when you're doing the regen.  And that's one that I hear a lot is, you know, some people say, well, why don't you buy all  your own feed?  
**[0:50:46-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:50:46):**  Because there's lots of regen beef guys who have switched to that because they'd rather  bring that carbon on, not have to make hay in the summer.  I would rather not make hay too if I could.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:51:00):**  But one problem is just the need for extreme high quality feed.  You don't always know what you're buying when you're buying it by the truckload from somebody  else off the spot market.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:51:16):**  Yes.  And so this year we switched to this one day hay, which I heard about on John Kemp's Regen  Egg podcast.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:51:24):**  And so basically we go out there at like nine in the morning, cut the hay, then at two o'clock  we go rake it and then we bale it in the evening and wrap it as quick as we can to get a high  quality silage.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:51:37):**  And so that's what we're doing to get the best quality hay, how many custom balers or  people who sell hay are going to do it like that.  Not too many.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:51:51):**  So why did you do that?  Why did you go to that one day hay?  I also got to kind of admit that I'm a little ignorant.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:00):**  I know it has to be cut, then baled, then raked.  But as far as the timing and where the humidity is and when you need to cut it, I've never  really bothered to learn any of that.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:12):**  Yeah.  So it's pretty interesting.  Anyone who's listening to this that really wants a good explanation should go to John  
**[0:52:20-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:20):**  Kemp's Regen Egg podcast and listen to it.  I think Elvin Peachey was the guy's name.  He was a Mennonite guy from, or Amish guy from Pennsylvania.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:29):**  But the idea is you're going to cut that hay first thing in the morning without crimpers.  Just cut it and lay it flat.  And the plant is going to keep photosynthesizing as it's laying there.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:43):**  And as it photosynthesizes, it adds sugar, just like it normally would.  And it uses up the water.  And the leaves are wet with photosynthesizing.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:52:53):**  So it sucks the water out of the stem to photosynthesize to dry the hay down really quick.  And then the leaves are the last thing to dry.  And they're what's having the most sugar.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:03):**  So you have less leaf loss.  And before this, I would be very skeptical that you'd be able to dry feed down in the  same day and bale it at your 45, 40, 45% moisture, which is what we want our baleage at.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:19):**  But it was amazing.  Like two hours after cutting our first cut, I did a moisture sample.  And it was already down to 62% moisture in two hours.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:29):**  And then we baled it.  And I haven't done one yet.  I just, you know, use it by hand.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:33):**  And I would say it got down to close to that 40% moisture in eight hours.  And the idea is that you have the highest amount of sugar then.  Because as you go overnight, if you left it on the ground overnight, the humidity would  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:49):**  change.  And you'd lose a lot of the sugar.  And you'd lose a lot of sugar.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:53:54):**  And it's like breaking down that sugar already.  Like it would start essentially, especially if you have it in a windrow, it essentially  start composting on you and breaking down that sugar before you got it into a bale and  
**[0:54:06-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:06):**  got all the oxygen out of it.  Have you have you checked the sugar levels in that hay versus do it the other way?  Not yet.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:16):**  No, we haven't got our feed samples back yet.  But it's going to be interesting to see if there's a big difference or not.  I'd be interested to know if you could send me a message or post on our Facebook group  
**[0:54:28-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:28):**  Ranching Reboot Paddock.  That'd be great.  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:31):**  We didn't we didn't do some with the crimpers, just because it was a bit of a pain to loosen  them all the way off.  And I didn't have to loosen them off and tighten them back up to compare the two.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:44):**  But yeah, like, it'll be interesting to see if that makes a difference.  But yeah, that's what I was kind of getting at is that's part of the challenge of during  dairy is that, you know, you have to make that feed when it's right.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:54:59):**  And even if you're like, lots of big dairies are straight custom, custom harvesters, which  is great if you're in a high dairy area where there's lots of custom guys who know what  they're doing.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:55:11):**  And if they don't know what they're doing, you can hire someone else who does.  Whereas where we are, there's only three dairies close by.  So if I one year we did grow corn, and the corn was ready to go, and the custom guy wasn't  
**[0:55:27-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:55:27):**  anywhere near us and wasn't going to come out of his way just for us.  And he only makes custom corn silage for beef people mainly.  And so our standard we wanted, you know, the kernel processor to be on there shredding  
**[0:55:41-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:55:41):**  every single kernel, and he wanted to get through our field as fast as possible so he  could get on to the next guy.  And so that really, you know, it turns us off like, you know, custom workers or even

But as far as heifers and dry cows, I'm definitely looking at buying in feed for them rather  
**[0:56:07-0:56:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:56:07):**  than producing our own because they don't need that high energy in that standard.  Oh, I think we might be muted there Brian.  Hey, I was muted.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:56:20):**  It was bound to happen at least once.  Sean, like, you're just banging through all these questions that I had written down with  just like, ready to go.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:56:32):**  So what's a bad recs you want to talk about and what they've taught you?  Yeah, yeah.  We got a couple that we could talk about.  
**[0:56:46-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:56:46):**  The weed situation is one, so we kind of already covered that of what happened.  But another thing that we encountered is the last, I'd say, three years for sure, we're  planting forage cover crop mixes, chooses forage.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:57:05):**  So generally we have either barley or oats as the main one because they grow good in  our area and then up to 14 species total.  We'll throw a bunch of different stuff in there.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:57:19):**  And the last three years we have had very poor, poor results from it.  And we were trying to figure out what was going on and we don't use synthetic fertilizer  anymore.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:57:31):**  So we were like, oh, maybe it's a nutrition problem for the fields.  Couldn't really figure it out.  And so this year, last year we decided we're going to do far-eye instead because people  
**[0:57:48-0:57:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:57:48):**  have been having success with it.  So we planted it a little late, but it came up and then the spring came up and then it  just all started disappearing.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:57:56):**  And like, you could just see the rows just start disappearing.  So I took a picture and put it on Facebook and a girl who I know from Saskatchewan who's  an agronomist says that looks like wireworm damage.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:58:07):**  And insect problems had not even come into our head because we have flea beetles that  come and eat the turnips and stuff that are in the mixes, but not enough that it really  damages.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:58:20):**  In theory, if you have high enough bricks, you're not supposed to have insect problems.  So we just hadn't really thought of that.  So I phoned a local agronomist, he came out and sure enough we had wireworms and they  
**[0:58:33-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:58:33):**  eat the seed and you don't get any germination.  And so we ended up buying some treated oats, forage oats instead and reseeding, spraying  out what was left of the far-eye, reseeding forage oats, forage peas, tilled radish and  
**[0:58:53-0:59:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:58:53):**  crimson clover.  And it looks amazing.  And so one thing it's taught me is that we need more people in the regen ag business  
**[0:59:07-0:59:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:59:07):**  who are professionals in those fields who aren't trying to sell us something, but I  don't know how they're going to make a living if they're not trying to sell us something.  Because even this local guy from our co-op, we call him, he comes out and helps us out,  
**[0:59:21-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:59:21):**  but it's like all we buy from him is some glyphosate every year.  We don't buy any other products.  We'll probably start buying seed from them just so that we can create a working relationship  
**[0:59:34-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:59:34):**  with them.  But I think there's a need in the regen ag industry for professionals who aren't trying  to sell you something.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:59:42):**  And so that money might have to come from funding from whoever's putting money into  regen.  That's a great point, Sean.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=0:59:55):**  How do we educate more people on these regenerative practices and where's the technical assistance  at and where's it going to come from?  And obviously up north in Canada, it's going to look completely different because your  
**[1:00:09-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:00:09):**  government ag situation is completely different than ours.  You sound optimistic about maybe government coming in and funding some regen ag educators.  I have a hard time wrapping my head around it right now, how that might work in this  
**[1:00:29-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:00:29):**  country because of the way things are set up.  And you're absolutely right.  What's in it for me?  
**[1:00:36-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:00:36):**  What can I sell you?  I mean, it's a lot more difficult to just sell advice and knowledge than it is to sell  a product.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:00:49):**  Yes, for sure.  So that's a challenge.  That's definitely a challenge.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:00:59):**  I'd say there's more and more private industry who is looking to regen ag as a way to increase  their social standing, stuff like that.  I know there's this foundation called the Alice Foundation in Canada and I'm on their  
**[1:01:19-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:01:19):**  producer advisory council.  I know AMW, which is a major fast food restaurant, they just signed a partnership with Alice  putting money in.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:01:31):**  And we had a meeting, they didn't say who, but another similar type group wants to and  to look into Alice.  And so that's kind of where I look at it.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:01:41):**  The problem is those companies want acres.  They want to say we have a million acres under this.  And it could just be a guy switching from till to no till and they'll call it that,  
**[1:01:54-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:01:54):**  where it's like if we really want to help, we need educators to help these farmers go  through it.  If you just switch and you don't know what you're looking for or what you're getting,  
**[1:02:07-1:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:02:07):**  you don't really get much.  And then how do we verify outcomes?  How do we verify that somebody really is regenerative and they're doing their part on their acres  
**[1:02:19-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:02:19):**  to improve soil quality and water quality and air quality?  As a fellow producer, I don't have any answers.  I still have a lot of questions myself.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:02:31):**  I still have a lot of questions myself, but I think it's better to be in front of things  than to be behind them.  I think it's the time to get off the fence and start moving towards more regenerative  
**[1:02:46-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:02:46):**  practices has definitely come.  And I hope everybody that's listening to this is starting down that road.  You mentioned you're only one of several, just a handful of dairies in the area.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:00):**  So what are you mostly surrounded by?  Are you mostly like commodity crops or pastures or what do your neighbors do?  Yeah, mainly commodity crops and then some beef farmers and stuff around here too.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:15):**  So it's like wheat and canola are the dominant crops and then people do grow some other things  like barley and oats and some soybeans, some other specialty crops, but mainly wheat and  canola.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:29):**  Do you like hockey?  Yes.  Who's your hockey team?  
**[1:03:36-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:36):**  The Winnipeg Jets because they came back to Manitoba 10 years ago or something like that.  Were you a little offended by that?  That he even asked that?  
**[1:03:48-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:48):**  No, it's small town boy in the prairies.  You either like hockey or curling as your winter sport in Canada.  So I'm a hockey guy.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:03:57):**  I figured I like hockey, but I'm more of a minor league hockey guy.  There's no major league NHL teams within any sort of reasonable drive distance to go watch.  But I do love my minor league hockey.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:04:10):**  Probably still a lot of Canadians playing on those minor league teams.  Usually, it's half or better.  Yeah.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:04:19):**  So what motivates you right now to get out of bed?  Well, right now, it's a fun time of year for sure.  Like there's always something, we're always trying something different.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:04:38):**  And I always like that.  Like right now, it didn't go real well because it's been so dry, but we tried to plant this  forage corn, but it's a high-tilling brown midrib forage corn that was supposed to be  
**[1:04:52-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:04:52):**  just for grazing cows on.  So I was pretty excited about that.  It didn't go so well because it's so dry.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:04:57):**  But still, doing stuff like that gets me excited and gets me into things.  I mean, there's definitely a lot more interest in regen ag.  And I can never get tired of talking about it.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:05:13):**  So that's good too.  There's more and more people asking me about it and asking me how we do things.  What are some new practices that you're thinking about implementing?  
**[1:05:25-1:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:05:25):**  Well, one thing that we've thought about is a graze-away sort gate.  So right now, like I said, we let the cows out the whole group twice a day.  But then if they want to, they can go out any time to pasture.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:05:43):**  They just have to go through the robot.  The problem is with cows being herd animals, when there's only one cow going out every  seven minutes, they don't really want to walk out there on their own.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:05:52):**  So you can get a gate that will read the callouts on their neck.  And let's say she's only been milked five hours ago, she doesn't need to get milked  right now.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:06:05):**  It'll just let her go outside.  So then at any point of the day, you could have a large portion of your herd go outside.  Only the ones that need to get milked stay inside.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:06:16):**  And that might be able to help us utilize pasture for more of our dry matter intake  on a daily basis.  We get good usage of pasture at nights.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:06:30):**  I think it would help from that 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. time period.  Whereas we would like to have the cows going out and grazing them because it's not that  hot, but it also is the busiest time for the robot.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:06:45):**  So you can't really let them out too much before 10 a.m. because that's when the robot's  busiest when they get up and come back in from a night of grazing and then they all  want to get milked.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:06:57):**  But maybe with a graze-away gate, we'd be able to get more of our cows out in that time.  So that's something.  And more and more, I want to keep trying different biological applicants on our fields.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:07:14):**  I had made some high fungal compost using the Johnson-Sue method two years ago and used  it a bit on our farm and just used it as a four-year applicant with our sprayer and just  did some test strips, would go out to one of our smaller paddocks and do half of it  
**[1:07:35-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:07:35):**  with it, leave half of it.  And we actually saw some pretty interesting results.  And the one field I'd say probably made twice as much tonnage just from a four-year applicant  
**[1:07:46-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:07:46):**  of this stuff.  It's very time-consuming to make and hard to make.  Well, not hard, but yeah, just mainly time-consuming.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:07:56):**  So I'd like to have more time to do try stuff like that and give that a try and see if that  can extend the length of our hay fields by applying a high fungal to make that fungal  to bacteria ratio higher so that our alfalfa can stay in that field longer without it going  
**[1:08:15-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:08:15):**  to a more bacterial field.  That sounds really neat.  That sounds pretty cool.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:08:24):**  I forgot what I was going to ask you next.  Oh, you said biological applicants.  Is it just the compost that you're doing?  
**[1:08:31-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:08:31):**  Yeah, that's what we've tried so far.  I'd probably need someone who understands it better to go even further into that type  thing.  
**[1:08:45-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:08:45):**  I mean, we don't have any extra milk at the time right now, but we have tried milk  before just putting it on because it's got such high sugar that it can really boost  your soil biology just by applying milk on your soil.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:09:03):**  Right now, just on the high fungal compost extract.  I had something else.  Had something else but I lost it.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:09:19):**  So if we could bring back any three people alive or dead and you could have them over  for dinner, who would they be and why?  We haven't done this one in a while.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:09:38):**  I don't know.  I mean, it would be really interesting to have either one of my grandpas over because  they're both farmers.  
**[1:09:47-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:09:47):**  One was a dairy farmer, the other one was a beef farmer.  So either one of them would be very cool to have back and just hear the stories about  how they grew up because everyone knows that farms were a lot different back then, but  
**[1:10:02-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:10:02):**  a lot of regen people are moving towards those things in terms of diversifying and everything  like that.  Nicole Masters would be someone who I would really like to be around and listen to her  
**[1:10:16-1:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:10:16):**  talk because the stuff that she talks about is just crazy in terms of biological applicants  and soil biology.  So yeah, she'd probably be one.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:10:28):**  I can't think of another one right off the top of my head, but she's someone who I'm  hoping to someday get out to our farm because I think she would be someone who would just  be able to help the farm reach another level.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:10:43):**  And I hope someday I'll get her on this podcast.  Yes, yes, she'd be a great guest.  So where can we find you on social media, Sean?

Mainly just our farm page, Clanman Jersey is on Facebook.  And so yeah, I thought about doing one page just for my soil and regen stuff and then  
**[1:11:11-1:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:11:11):**  another one for my dairy genetics, but I decided I'm going to combine them so that the people  that are here looking for my cows, they still get all the info we're doing on soil health.  And the people that are there for soil health get to see your good looking...  
**[1:11:30-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:11:30):**  That's the best place to go.  Clanman Jersey is on Facebook.  And the people that come looking for soil health get a look at your pretty cows.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:11:38):**  Exactly.  I might stop my video here just to see if I can look like I said I was unstable.  Is there anything you'd like to ask me or ask CK why you've got us here?  
**[1:11:55-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:11:55):**  Yeah, I guess is there anything that after other dairy conversations that were in your  head that you guys still, that maybe I didn't answer or just like, you know, something that  stood out that you thought maybe dairy farmers still could push the boundaries and try to  
**[1:12:17-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:12:17):**  get more regenerative and maybe you could just ask me and see what I think about something  like that.  Well I mean, you heard the first several episodes, I know you at least listened to the Honey  
**[1:12:31-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:12:31):**  Creek episode.  What are some other ways that dairy producers could transition to a lower input, more regenerative  system?  
**[1:12:43-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:12:43):**  I mean, besides grazing young stock.  What I mean, is there anything else on your mind?  One thing is it's probably going to be pretty controversial.  
**[1:12:53-1:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:12:53):**  But like for dairy farming, I think there is a size limit.  And your last guy that you had on that was talking about, he kind of briefly talked about  that, about how if they were to keep expanding, they wouldn't be able to get as much dry matter  
**[1:13:10-1:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:13:10):**  out of their pastures.  So I think if you do want to be regenerative, there is a size limit because cows can only  walk so far for pasture.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:13:21):**  And so let's just take New Zealand for example, beautiful place, tons of dairy down there  and it's all grass-based, but they still have pollution problems in their water system.  And most people would say that grass-based is the best thing for pollution, but there's  
**[1:13:44-1:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:13:44):**  still, I shouldn't say this with absolute certainty, but I'm pretty sure lots of them  are still using fertilizer because they're trying to graze too many cows on too small  of acres and they're not being able to give those acres rest periods that it needs to  
**[1:14:00-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:14:00):**  stay healthy.  So then they're using fertilizer.  And then when you're using fertilizer and have cows on there all the time, you have  
**[1:14:07-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:14:07):**  too much nutrients and it ends up in your water system.  So I think there is a size limit for if you're going to graze your cows and go as far, regen  as you can in the dairy industry, unless you get a portable milker.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:14:23):**  But those things, I haven't seen one in action.  I've only seen pitchers and they seem pretty cool, but they're yeah.  We'll just put it out there right now.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:14:32):**  If you are a grazing dairy with a mobile milker, call me, get in touch.  Let's do another dairy episode some other time.  One thing that's on my mind is manure pits.  
**[1:14:47-1:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:14:47):**  Like can you talk about the difference in the decomposition processes between when the  manure is in a pit and a slurry versus when it's in the pasture?  Can you talk about that at all?  
**[1:15:04-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:15:04):**  I don't know quite the science of it probably is good, but certainly that when it's in  a slurry, it is gassing off.  Like you are definitely losing ammonia in those situations.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:15:22):**  It's a different decomposition process, right?  Yes, definitely.  And so like there's like when you, before you say you have a big slurry, before you  
**[1:15:33-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:15:33):**  go to spread it, you're going to agitate it a bunch to just to break up any solid particles,  make it all a nice, consistent liquid.  And there's companies that are selling bacteria that you can put in while you're agitating  
**[1:15:47-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:15:47):**  to try to get it out of that anaerobic state.  Whichever way it goes.  Like I said, I'm not necessarily the best person for this.  
**[1:15:57-1:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:15:57):**  But there is, I mean, the times when I see the best results from cows being on pasture  is early spring before our grass really starts growing.  We keep bale grazing and we will put those animals in as tight of an area as we can keep  
**[1:16:15-1:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:16:15):**  them in without them breaking through a fence and having bale grazing in there.  And just like that urine going straight onto the unfrozen ground in the spring and manure  going straight, like it is crazy the growth you will get out of there.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:16:29):**  And they'll have it eaten down like a carpet, any grass that's there.  And you would think that'd be bad.  And it just bounces back like crazy.  
**[1:16:37-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:16:37):**  So I don't think there's anything replacing that direct contact with the soil as soon  as it comes out of the cow.  So what about soil tests?  
**[1:16:47-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:16:47):**  Have you done much soil testing?  I did, but not back yet.  Yeah, no, we just sent some away for some Haney and phosphoric acid tests, but haven't  
**[1:16:59-1:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:16:59):**  gone back yet.  That new PLFA test that tells you fungal microbial balance?  Yeah.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:17:04):**  Cool.  Cool.  I'd be interested to hear your results.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:17:10):**  Let's put a pin in this and maybe we'll circle back in a year.  I hope we're still doing this in a year, but I'd love to have you back on to talk about  some of your results and some of your test results later down the line.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:17:25):**  Yeah, for sure.  I'm hoping that we can start doing a little bit more of that type of stuff.  That's why we took these Haney tests.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:17:38):**  Not so much because we're going to add fertility in a synthetic way, but more just to manage  it and know how to manage it and be able to compare those, use those as benchmarks.  Sometimes with regen egg, it's tough to look across the fence line or the road and see  
**[1:17:57-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:17:57):**  these amazing artificially dark green fields beside you and think, and look at yours, it's  a bit slower coming on and think that you're making progress, but those tests are going  to be a way to help you make sure that you are.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:18:14):**  Those fields of corn that are all six feet tall and perfect and the same exact stage  of growth, it's nice to look at, but we got to understand what it takes to get it there  too.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:18:24):**  Yeah.  Well, Sean, it's been very, very enjoyable today.  I think if you don't have anything else for us, I think we'll let you go and get back  
**[1:18:35-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:18:35):**  with your work.  I know you dairymen are the hardest working guys in Ag.  Well, it's been awesome being on.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:18:43):**  First podcast I've ever done.  So after listening for so long, it's good to finally get on one.  Well, I think we'll have you back again in about a year to talk about some of the results  
**[1:18:54-1:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/22-Sean-Smith--A-Robot-Milking-Grazing-Dairy-in-Canada-e14lsp7#t=1:18:54):**  you've seen and changes you've made and I'm excited.  All right.  Well, thank you guys very much for having me.

Back with your weekly episode of Ranching Reboot.  This week's guest we brought on to talk about some of the issues that are facing quite a  
**[0:01:04-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:04):**  few of us.  Succession and people management.  And when it comes to the topic of succession, I think he's got quite a bit of experience.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:12):**  His family ranch dates back to the early 1800s with the Spanish land grant.  They had a family partnership that ran for 113 years and a family corporation that was  around for about 50.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:23):**  They've been through multiple succession events and he's got a lot of great perspectives  on the subject.  So stick around and enjoy the conversation we have today with John Coleman Locke from  
**[0:01:34-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:34):**  the Locke division of the world famous J.D.  Hudgens Brahma operation.  So you're in, I never know the town, but you're basically outside of Houston, right?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:43):**  Yeah, we're 50 miles southwest of Houston.  What's the, is it super hot still there?  Oh yeah.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:50):**  It's always hot.  You like hot though.  I've read that on your social media.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:01:53):**  You like hot weather.  I do, but it's funny because that's one of my personal challenges the last, I guess six  or eight months.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:01):**  I'm actually getting comfortable with the cold.  Oh wow.  From traveling and stuff.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:05):**  Yeah, traveling and then just one of those things I've always, always dreaded cold and  hated cold and started to investigate how much of that's in my head and how much of  it's real.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:17):**  So but I like my sweat.  It's good for you.  Well, how was everything last February?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:23):**  How, how did the polar vortex reach you down there and hunger for Texas?  Man, it was wild.  It's funny how these weather events happen.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:33):**  Like we, when we had Harvey, you know, it's like nothing on the radar, nothing going on.  And then all of a sudden they have this spectacular storm.  So accurately predicted two weeks out.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:46):**  And most of the time they can't tell us with any accuracy, whether it's going to rain tomorrow  or not.  Right.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:53):**  And then you get to the vortex.  It's like when it started getting closer and you start hearing, okay, well, this is going  to happen.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:02:59):**  This is going to happen.  It's going to get down to this, you know, to eight degrees.  And at first you think, no, there's no way.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:04):**  And then all of a sudden, you know, the closer it gets, you think, man, this really, really  might come to fruition.  And it was cool.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:15):**  People get pretty dramatic around weather events with good reason, but it's funny.  Maybe Harvey just taught me that, or maybe it's every accumulation of all the other stuff  that I've been through.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:25):**  Right.  It's just something that, you know, it's just a challenge and something to manage through.  And then hopefully you can tell your grandkids about.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:33):**  So we got down to eight, many, many people in this area lost power for days on end.  It's we're not set up for it.  You know, construction's not right for it.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:43):**  We don't even have the proper gel and our diesel fuel and that kind of stuff.  We were lucky.  We only lost power for like eight or 10 hours.  
**[0:03:51-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:03:51):**  And we kind of had a cool plan for the cows and everything worked perfectly.  We lost one baby calf that actually was born during the freeze and a little out of season.  And it was it lived and it was like three days later, it got down into the thirties  
**[0:04:08-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:04:08):**  and we'd moved the cows away from shelter and we lost it then.  So the cows handle it really well.  And just, you know, another learning experience.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:04:17):**  So a good deal.  So John, for our listeners, why don't you tell us where you're at and a little bit about  your operation.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:04:27):**  OK, so we're 50 miles southwest of Houston.  Our headquarters is in a little town called Hungerford.  My ranching operation in my main cow herd is out just outside of a little town called  
**[0:04:40-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:04:40):**  Glen Flora, which is Spanish for Flower Meadow.  And it's about six miles north of Wharton, Texas.  Fairly interesting story, I guess.  
**[0:04:50-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:04:50):**  Our ancestors settled this area in the late well, actually, the early eighteen hundreds  would have been mixed up on my grades.  But like my great, great, great grandfather came to Texas in eighteen thirty nine years  
**[0:05:04-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:05:04):**  after the Alamo and settled basically in this area and around the turn of the century or  just before with this, I guess you could call it cruel environment that we have here and  their struggle to make a living in any kind of agribusiness, but mainly in ranching.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:05:23):**  They identified that the Indian cattle were.  Cattle that could handle the humidity and insects.  And so they started to latch on to all the Indian genetics that they could get, which  
**[0:05:34-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:05:34):**  was not easy in that time.  And so nineteen oh eight, our official family partnership was formed.  So we've been one hundred thirteen years in business this year as a as a partnership.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:05:46):**  And then in nineteen sixty three, we were incorporated.  So we've existed in this part of Texas ever since then.  And the core business and the focus is on Brahma and genetics.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:05:58):**  We're kind of a worldwide supplier from genetics, but we do a lot of work here in the states  as well, mostly with live animals here in the states.  So that's in a nutshell, that's what we do.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:10):**  We are in the brown business and we're on the coastal bend of Texas where it's hot and  humid until it gets cold.  I don't imagine those those creatures with the big floppy ears, they work pretty well  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:22):**  for you down there, don't they?  They do.  They do.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:26):**  We we say that they didn't read the same book that other cattle read.  Right.  They're they're a little different, but they have their place.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:36):**  You know, there's some challenges with them, but they're they're unique.  There's a lot of things I love about them.  And, you know, for instance, in our grazing people always ask me about shade.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:47):**  Is shade an issue?  And I tell them that our cattle get plenty of shade from sundown to sunup.  They can soak up all the shade they want.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:06:54):**  And then when the sun comes up, it's time to get to work.  And for the most part, you know, it doesn't affect them.  We do have some crossbred cattle.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:07:01):**  So you get to have a good side by side comparison of how they handle the elements.  Okay, we we can kind of circle back to your cows later.  But what I'd really like to talk about today is a little bit more of the history of the  
**[0:07:16-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:07:16):**  ranch and succession people management.  You know, I know from some of our previous conversations that you guys went through kind  of a major succession event in the recent past.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:07:28):**  Was it 10, 12, 15 years ago, something like that?  Yes, 2010.  We put that started in I think 2007 and it took us about three years to work through  
**[0:07:39-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:07:39):**  it.  And you've got another one come up that you're dealing with right now to correct?  Well somewhat my kids are young and and you know, there's never it's never too early to  
**[0:07:51-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:07:51):**  start thinking about that and start planning for it.  And so I'm going to RFP succession intensive next week.  And I'm, you know, really excited about that just to put more tools in my toolbox and to  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:08:04):**  learn more from Dave and to work through my own situation.  So yes, I don't I can't tell you where this business would be exactly in 20 years from  now.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:08:13):**  But I do want to start to lay the groundwork where we can do a good job with succession  with my generation and my kids.  Can we talk about that succession event in 2007 to 2010 a little bit and you know, with  
**[0:08:28-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:08:28):**  getting into the any of the family specifics, you know, what were some of the wrecks?  What did you learn from it?  And what are you changing?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:08:38):**  As far as your succession plan in order to pass it to the next generation?  Sure.  And if you give me a little bit of latitude, I might back all the way up to you know, the  
**[0:08:50-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:08:50):**  1908 partnership in the 1963 deal.  Sure.  Our family has always been the fair is equal equal is fair mindset.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:09:00):**  Many of my dad's generation and many of my generation still feel the same about that.  So start when I started in a way they had specific positions for you know, whatever  your talents aligned with.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:09:15):**  And people manage certain parts of the ranch like the porridge and then somebody else managed  the facilities.  And it existed like that from away to 63 and it kind of got to be a monster.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:09:24):**  And the family was just living out of the same bank account.  And so a succession event precipitated the 1963 split was just one big ranch with at  that time, probably 2000 cows, and everybody had their own jobs, and they worked well together.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:09:41):**  And one of the ancestors came in and said, I want to, you know, I want my land, I'll  sell the cows to you at a reasonable cost, but we need to part ways.  And so my great uncle was was really wise and was a great cattleman.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:09:55):**  And he was very proactive.  And he said, Okay, I think it took him a day and a half to sit down and say, this is the  way we're going to do it.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:10:02):**  So they split the ranch into five at that point.  And they split the land, and the cow herds and everybody got pretty much an equal share.  And we became incorporated.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:10:13):**  And so I had somebody that was studying family businesses that was in the Oh, the drew a  total blank, but the the program that were a lot of these scholars travel around the  world and different things.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:10:30):**  I'll think of it a minute.  But anyway, somebody came here and they were studying our family history.  And they said, Oh, this is really fascinating, because what most families do is they go on  
**[0:10:41-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:10:41):**  is they continue to put stuff together and grow it, put stuff together and grow it.  And you guys came to the decision at some point that you better separate it so that  you could stay together.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:10:50):**  And so that's probably the only reason why we're still in business, because if you'd  imagine all of those ancestors continue to grow and try and operate out of the same bank  account, and, and, you know, just got to be a monster.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:11:01):**  So that we have that history in my family.  And the fair but equal thing or equal is fair and fair is equal thing.  So my grandparents were raised like that, and they were a product of having that succession  
**[0:11:17-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:11:17):**  occur before.  So that that was their experience.  So basically, my dad, his three siblings all had a 25% undivided interest in everything.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:11:27):**  You know, there was no specificity, and nothing, you know, when I tell this, I'm very candid  and very open about telling stories like this.  And I don't want people to ever misunderstand me that I'm being critical of the way things  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:11:40):**  were done.  Because everybody did the best they could with information that they had.  I don't hold anything against everything happens for a reason.  
**[0:11:48-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:11:48):**  So nothing gets my grandparents, nothing gets my aunts and uncles, everything's great.  But basically, that was the communication was that this is all going to be y'alls, all  25% undivided interest.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:12:02):**  And so then then nothing else was done.  And I think when they did it, they probably had the thought that, well, we will grow this  business, and we'll do this and we'll be in a position one day to where it will be really  
**[0:12:12-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:12:12):**  easy to share all of this.  And, you know, as we know, in agriculture, sometimes it doesn't always work out that  way.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:12:22):**  So at that point, when everything kind of hit the fan, there had been one attempt to  reach out and communicate from my dad's siblings at one point, and my grandfather and grandmother  kind of just squashed it and, and nothing came out of it.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:12:41):**  And then about five years later, six years later, I think it was, it was kind of like  they were pointing their lives to where they needed something to happen.  They wanted their 25%.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:12:56):**  And so they initiated that discussion, and that was in, I think it was in 2007.  So I've been home for six years, pretty much managing the ranch alongside my dad.  And it was tough, you know, to think about the future and what's going to happen, and  
**[0:13:13-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:13:13):**  how we're going to make this work.  And their idea initially was, we're just gonna sell the whole thing, and split up, split  the money.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:13:23):**  Whatever you guys do with your money, fair enough, you know, and of course, we didn't  want to see that because for obvious reasons, all the hard work going down the drain, the  generations and everything else.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:13:34):**  So it took us a long time to sort of work through it.  And I guess it was that it was good and bad, because by the time we were so frustrated,  by the time we got to the end, it was just time to make a deal and get it over with.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:13:52):**  There was a lawsuit in there at one point, which, you know, created some pretty deep  scars with some.  And I saw my dad struggling with it.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:14:04):**  And, you know, he lost years of his life, I think just from the stress of it all.  And I think one of the things that just to share with your listeners, that I learned  from it, one of the biggest things I learned from it, for whatever reason, again, I don't  
**[0:14:19-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:14:19):**  sound critical that that generation, the traditionalist generation, they aren't built to communicate  and to get in touch with the emotions of this stuff and to work through it.  It's very, very hard for them, whether it's the way they raised or the time that they  
**[0:14:36-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:14:36):**  were raised in.  And that was probably the hardest thing.  You know, I think I heard Jolene Brown speaking about this not too long ago.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:14:47):**  And she said that everything we do in the ranch, we're used to doing really well.  And we don't know how to do that.  So our solution is just to not do it.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:14:58):**  And that was the frustrating part was just well, let's just hold the line and everything  will work itself out instead of instead of being proactive.  Of course, that was all before I had any I've never been ranch proper school didn't have  
**[0:15:11-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:15:11):**  an executive link board.  So I was just up late at night, eating half of a half gallon of bluebell ice cream, stressing,  trying to figure out scribbling numbers down on paper, trying to figure out what the heck  
**[0:15:24-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:15:24):**  to do.  Finding a method to communicate is my my number one thing and figuring out how to get people  to put their cards on the table.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:15:37):**  Because there was things we learned at the very end, that if we would have known in the  beginning, part of the reason why the the event was initiated, it was it was almost  laughable.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:15:49):**  I mean, it was it was almost silly that what had happened.  And so they were pushing our hand.  And then the more they pushed, the more alarm bells were going off for us.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:15:59):**  And we were like, are they so insistent that we do this by this day?  And what's this?  So we thought they were up to no good.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:16:06):**  And what it initiated, they thought we were up to no good.  And everybody in the whole deal had good intentions the entire time, they just wanted to do something  and get it behind us.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:16:16):**  And so if we had figured out how to communicate from the beginning, it would have made it  a lot easier and all of us.  You know, I seem to remember something my dad mentioned about when they had their succession  
**[0:16:33-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:16:33):**  a great when they had their succession with the Skinner family, back in the early 80s,  if people would just communicate, just be honest about what you want out of the end  goal, and talk about it and try not to keep secrets and don't angle for position.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:16:53):**  Just talk to the other parties and be open about this is what I want, guys, you know,  like, we know that, you know, it's undivided interest, whatever percent, whatever percent,  but this is the part that's important for me to continue.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:17:09):**  Right?  Yeah, that that that exactly but but you know, it's easier said that.  And I, I like to see people get help on things like this.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:17:22):**  Of course, I didn't know what that I didn't do it.  I didn't get any help, you know, maybe talk to a friend or two.  And a lot of times that helped, like, I guess it looks expensive, and you don't know who  
**[0:17:34-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:17:34):**  to reach out to.  But man talk about a lot of value and having somebody that can be the mediator to, to help  draw these things out and to get to the, the, you know, the interest versus the position.  
**[0:17:50-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:17:50):**  And it's, that would have helped us immensely.  But yeah, there was so many so many things, we were holding our carts close to our chest,  and we're worried about this and that and the what ifs.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:18:01):**  And at the end of the day, the funny thing is, is that we ended up at the end of that  succession event with a quarter of the landmass and less than half the cow herd and have been  more successful since and have, you know, had the same overheads, we didn't lose, we  
**[0:18:23-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:18:23):**  did not cut loose any overheads, maybe some minimal overheads with land taxes or whatnot,  but we leased a little bit of that land back, you know, now we're back up to about the same  size, not on all own owned land, but been, you know, way more successful because the  
**[0:18:43-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:18:43):**  funny thing is, is that looking back, it feels like those silent partners were a pretty handy  excuse for all those years for, you know, the stuff that we couldn't do or we wouldn't  do or, well, it'd be nice to do this or that we couldn't get everybody to agree to it.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:03):**  Once we put ourselves in a position where we had to roll our own boat, you know, then  then we started to be more successful.  So  
**[0:19:13-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:13):**  sorry, CK, I didn't mean to know I, I get I get asked a lot.  Because sometimes we get deals done really fast in our, the fund, just being in startup  mode.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:29):**  And they're like, how are you able to get this carbon deal done faster than someone  else?  And I'm like, well, we just don't have a lot of cooks in the kitchen.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:36):**  Like there's not a lot of people who have to give approval for this.  And so it's really nice to be able to make a decision that that is a decision, you don't  have to get approval from the board and then from the land, we had to get from the land  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:50):**  or but like 10 other people.  So I think that's, that's a powerful thing to say is what are our roadblocks?  And how do we remove them?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:19:58):**  And not saying that your family was blocked, but maybe was a both for both parties, a way  to be more, have more progress.  Yeah, and I think the I think it goes a little deeper than that, too.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:20:11):**  Because I think our brains too often, they're helping us take the easy way out.  So they might not have even been a roadblock on some things, but just the thought that  I can use them as an excuse.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:20:30):**  So I don't know, there's all kinds of things that have come to fruition since then that  just I wouldn't go back, you know, I would have done some things differently if I had  the knowledge then that I know that I have now, but I wouldn't go back to the way that  
**[0:20:46-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:20:46):**  it was.  So many of the changes we made on the ranch were 100% precipitated by that event.  You know, it's kind of like when they say, Oh, I got fired and I thought it was bad,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:20:58):**  but it turns out it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  We're talking about decision making and in a business type situation.  I am.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:12):**  I'm part ownership.  I'm management and I'm labor all rolled into one.  So if something needs to be done, I don't need to have two planning meetings to talk  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:20):**  about doing it and how we're going to execute it and where we're going to find the money.  It's just, Oh, do I have the money?  Yeah.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:26):**  Do I have the stuff?  Yeah.  Well, let's just go get it done then.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:29):**  So but then again, if anything really happens to me, there's not a lot of resiliency in  my organization.  Right.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:38):**  We're working on that.  Yeah.  Which we can kind of circle into people management a little bit.  
**[0:21:44-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:21:44):**  How are you addressing your labor needs on the lock division of JD Hudgens?  Well, so here again, sometimes I feel like I'm a little too open and a little too candid  about some of this stuff.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:22:04):**  So when people, I know the way that I've looked at some people in the past and people hear  that I'm teaching the wrench for profit school.  My biggest fear is somebody looks at me and says, Oh, that means he's got it all figured  
**[0:22:19-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:22:19):**  out.  Cause they would only let them teach if he's got it all figured out.  And so I've kind of been on a bit of a roller coaster labor wise for the last several years.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:22:32):**  And I've seen a lot of different stuff and done a lot of different stuff.  And I'm not going to say that I've got that figured out yet.  I recently have hired a high quality full-time employee.  
**[0:22:46-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:22:46):**  And I have been dealing with mostly part-time and intern labor for the better part of the  last four years, three and a half years.  And been, been for the most part, been really successful with it.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:23:00):**  And the way that I've been able to do that is to take some complex theories and complex  principles and make them absolutely as simple as possible and prioritize.  And I'm proud of the fact that if I'm going to take in an intern, a lot of it is my gut,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:23:21):**  but there's a lot of it just learning what questions to ask and how to read people then,  and the kind of intern that you're going to bring on board.  And then after that, it's having a training program.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:23:34):**  And this has all just been trial and error and having a very simple training program  to start with the highest priority and get these people on boarded and, and help them  understand what your mission is and what they're, what you're trying to accomplish with that  
**[0:23:48-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:23:48):**  position and then building on it.  And I've taken a lot of what appears to be complex stuff and really simplified it down  to where I can take somebody in and, you know, several days later I can leave for a week  
**[0:24:02-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:02):**  and they can manage stuff.  So but that put me in a position.  You want to license that system?  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:10):**  I mean, tell us your secrets.  Yeah.  I don't know if there are any secrets.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:16):**  I mean, there's things that I've had to do with this business that doesn't look like  a wise idea to some outsiders.  But it's for that reason that, you know, well, I can't have the, the most high school guy  
**[0:24:29-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:29):**  here all the time and do X, Y, and Z.  And you know, all of this crazy stuff because those guys are hard to find.  And when you do get them, they're not going to stay long.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:39):**  I don't have the kind of business to where I'm probably going to keep that guy for a  long time.  Ultimately I've been back and forth on this idea, but ultimately I would like to be some  
**[0:24:51-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:24:51):**  sort of an incubator for talented people with drive to come here as a step on their way  to go into something bigger.  And so I'm trying to build that a little bit more now.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:25:04):**  When I hired this higher quality full-time employee recently, it's made me question whether  I'm still going to stay on that path or not.  But that's definitely a thought because it's just the business that we're in.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:25:21):**  We had a guy workforce for 40 years and passed away, you know, and I don't know if we're  in that day and time anymore.  It's kind of funny to say that, but so I see a lot of really good employers that turn over  
**[0:25:37-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:25:37):**  people two and a half, three years and they're good employees as well.  So I don't know.  That's a, that's a really tough one.  
**[0:25:45-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:25:45):**  And ultimately the reason why I hired this quality full-time employee is because I took  a step back.  I could manage this ranch on probably 30 hours a week by myself, but then I took a step back  
**[0:26:00-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:26:00):**  and I said, well, is that the business that's going to allow me to live up to my potential?  And is the business going to be at its highest potential doing that?  Maybe that's something I do 15 years from now, you know, maybe that's something I do  
**[0:26:18-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:26:18):**  down the road, but so I'm back in a growth mindset.  I'm back in a high quality employee mindset, but I do have experience kind of on both sides  of it.

When I was younger, you know, I was the 80, a hundred hour a week guy and was pretty dead  
**[0:26:41-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:26:41):**  gun proud of it.  And once I had kids and got married, I just found out real fast that wasn't going to work.  So whatever you're doing, you probably are going to have to simplify things, whether  
**[0:26:55-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:26:55):**  you're doing it yourself, you're using quality employees or, or intern labor, whatever, not  that the interns aren't quality too, but you know what I'm saying?  So I think simplification and creating the systems to allow you to operate the business  
**[0:27:10-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:27:10):**  efficient, efficiently, or huge.  Okay.  I mean, you've got me really curious about some of these, you know, quote, complex principles  
**[0:27:22-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:27:22):**  that you've managed to simplify and, and kind of compartmentalize that you can teach.  And I'm just, I'm really curious as to what some of those are, if you'd want to share  those with us, because you know, we have a little bit of a history and I kind of know  
**[0:27:38-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:27:38):**  how you graze and how you run your cows.  So if you need to talk about some of that, some of the changes you made and, and, you  know, in order to bring on this employee and make it a workable environment for them, but  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:27:51):**  still make your business goals.  Yeah.  So I had a feeling that I made that sound way too good.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:27:58):**  Like this amazing, and now you want to know more.  No.  So let me think of some, some examples and really the grazing is probably the easiest,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:28:09):**  most obvious place to start.  You know, my style of grazing, but for your listeners that might not know I am a believer  thus far, everything is open to change at some point.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:28:26):**  I'm not going to say that my way is the right way, but an ultra high density selective grazing.  And so our cattle will move right now.  We're actually, we've slowed down a bit and our cows are moving four times a day.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:28:41):**  I have moved as many as 10 times a day, 10, 8, 10, 12 times a day, every day for a couple  of years, at least.  And the fact that I say that we're moving four times a day, a lot of people read that  
**[0:28:56-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:28:56):**  they say, Oh yeah, who would have guessed you got burned out?  And that's not necessarily the case.  It's not about burnout, but it's just about management and some other decisions.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:29:05):**  So, but the way that I graze, you could say, wow, a guy's going to have to, he's going  to have to study that to manage your system for two years to learn how to make decisions  and to figure out when to move the cows.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:29:21):**  And, you know, I think I can teach somebody how to do it in a couple of weeks.  Maybe not for some of the situations you get in.  Okay, well, we had four inches of rain overnight, they focus pasture, what do we do now?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:29:35):**  But it's not that hard the way we do it.  We observe the cow and the cattle tell us about 90% of what we want to know.  And then of course, we need to observe recovery and try to figure out what's going on with  
**[0:29:49-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:29:49):**  our, we need to observe our graze and our recovery.  But the cattle will tell you if you're doing a good job on your graze, and if you're doing  a good job on your recovery as well.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:30:00):**  So if I can teach somebody to go out there and read gut fill, manure and contentment,  you know, first thing in the morning and last thing.  And then it becomes more about giving them the tools and the procedures, standard operating  
**[0:30:18-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:30:18):**  procedures to be able to do their job efficiently, to where it's almost incidental, the mechanics  of doing the job, and they can spend their time using their brain to observe and to think,  okay, well, where should we go next?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:30:35):**  You know, what happened in this paddock?  And what are the cows telling me right now?  So there's little things like the way that we've designed our buggy to carry all of our  
**[0:30:45-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:30:45):**  tools, the way I teach somebody to put out a reel.  And it's all about priorities.  You know, we teach in the school that autonomy, mastery and purpose is three most important  
**[0:30:54-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:30:54):**  things for employees.  And so I don't want to have a robot that I've programmed to do X, Y, and Z, but I do want  to make sure that they're hitting the most important points, you know?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:06):**  And there's, so when I teach them that, I try to teach them why.  Okay, well, we hooked the reel on here.  And when we hooked the reel on, or the handle on the fence here, we already have the buggy  
**[0:31:19-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:19):**  pointing this way, just all the little things that go together to make their job easy and  efficient.  We've got to start in the day checklist and end of the day checklist.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:28):**  There'll be like five items on there.  And they're just big ticket, you know, important things.  And if you do those things, everything else will be okay.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:37):**  You know, we've got a standard operating procedure, but it's just a checklist.  When you move the cows, these are the things that are important.  And if you do those things, everything else will be okay.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:48):**  So that's how you take someone with little to no skills.  Can people still mess it up?  Yes, I've seen that.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:31:55):**  But and some of that comes from my experience as a pilot.  You know, when we have acronyms that you pre take off checklist, and there's so many acronyms  that we use, you do your gums check before landing.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:32:09):**  And so I carried that into ranching, because when somebody turns the cows into the next  paddock on a timer on a move, and that paddock was closed, you know, the gate was open and  they out went wound up for paddocks down.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:32:23):**  Okay, well, that's kind of like somebody landing with the gear up.  What what chain of events took place that caused that to happen?  So what do we need to do?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:32:32):**  And I feel like that's it's evolved, it's constantly evolving.  But there's a lot of stuff like that we've kind of figured out through the years that  we can teach people.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:32:44):**  You mentioned three things earlier, and you said them really fast.  And I think it was manure gut fill and contentment is what you're looking for on the cattle.  Yes.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:32:56):**  So why are the why are those the three most important things that you're looking at?  Because if you got a happy cattle, you're going to be making money.  And my opinion, you know, and I'm a Ian Mitchell Ennis, I guess you could say disciple, but  
**[0:33:15-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:33:15):**  how are we supposed to make money in the cattle business if our cattle aren't performing well?  In our environment, we can grow a whole lot of poor quality grass very fast.  And there comes a whole other set of challenges with probably grazing this environment.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:33:33):**  But if I can keep cows full and have their manure looking right, and they're happy, everything  should be okay.  You know, I mean, you think about a cow's job.  
**[0:33:46-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:33:46):**  Yeah, I mean, you could have a mineral imbalance, or you could have a terrible water quality  issue, but it's probably going to show itself in the cattle.  There's there's other things aside from contentment, like code and whatnot.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:34:01):**  But man.  So back to your original question about systems.  That in itself is just a system to where we don't have to go to the graze chart.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:34:15):**  Look at our rainfall totals, look at our, you know, the weather forecast, and do all  of these things to manage the cows.  We just have to watch the cows.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:34:28):**  And I like I love telling people this.  I think a lot of people probably think I'm stupid, but I firmly believe in it.  So as we get towards our summer slump, you know, if we do a good job of the three things  
**[0:34:43-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:34:43):**  I told you about day in and day out, we're monitoring our recovery and, you know, not  severely grazing.  When we start to get to summer slump one day, you'll see the cows laying down and happy  
**[0:34:54-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:34:54):**  at two o'clock in the afternoon.  You'll think, okay, well, that's a little different from yesterday.  And they're full, you know, full as can be.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:35:02):**  So maybe I'm going to plan to set them up a few acres tomorrow.  And then I'm going to see how that goes.  And then I'm going to set them up a few acres, fewer acres the day after that and keep monitoring  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:35:12):**  that as long as they're full.  And as long as their manure looks good.  Now, if something like that's going on, and the manure starts to stack and start to be  
**[0:35:19-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:35:19):**  a little bit hollow, and you got plenty of feed, and we can't graze around that, then  we'll look at, you know, possibly supplementing with something.  So but I'll look in over the course of a week, I will change my recovery from 25 days to  
**[0:35:36-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:35:36):**  40 days without looking at anything other than the cow.  And when you get back around to that first paddock, you're like, just about right.  So it's just simplifying.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:35:49):**  And I think learning how to observe the cattle, what they're telling you is probably one of  the most important skills as far as the grazer is concerned.  I would definitely agree.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:02):**  And you know, to some extent, you can't really do it from a cake truck.  I mean, you can't do it from the feed wagon, because you're not going to see the contentment,  you're not going to get a good idea of gut fill, they're going to get excited, and they're  
**[0:36:17-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:17):**  going to be running for you.  And they're going to want that snack.  It's one of those things that, you know, you've either got to do on foot, you know, calmly  
**[0:36:25-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:25):**  out there, just on your everyday routine, horseback, whatever.  But it's just not something that can really get down to the feed truck, right?  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:34):**  And I have a distinct advantage.  And I understand that, you know, I'm not on big country, like you are.  There's a lot of people when I start preaching about this stuff, they're like, Oh, how do  
**[0:36:45-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:45):**  you do that on a on a 6000 acre paddock?  I don't know, I'd like to try, you know, I'd like to try to figure it out.  Maybe one day I will.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:36:56):**  But I think in Mitchell Eames, he says just divide it in half and do do something with  the worst half or something like that.  Right.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:05):**  So you got to know once you're comfortable with that, once you get comfortable with that  divided again.  Yeah.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:11):**  I have the other distinct advantage to moving cattle so frequently makes the management  so easy.  People think that that's counterintuitive and that it's more work and more trouble.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:26):**  But if you can figure out how to do it, it's fine tuning that management versus Oh, we  had them in a paddock for 24 hours.  How did that work out?  
**[0:37:36-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:36):**  Well, at what point did they start grazing severely?  Well, you know, we don't really know.  But and I always tell people this, too.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:45):**  And I think they laugh at me.  If you move cattle 10 times a day for a year, that's 3650 learning opportunities versus  moving them once a day for a year.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:37:56):**  That's right.  And old.  So I don't know, it's it's been a lot of fun doing that kind of stuff.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:38:02):**  But now I'm trying to step back into the CEO, people manager role and put that on, you know,  help somebody else develop that skill.  And so I did do way too much technician work for too long.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:38:23):**  But I don't regret it because it's great experience.  And I've learned a lot.  And it's still what I enjoy doing.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:38:29):**  But there's this other things that I need to focus on now.  We can circle it back around to the next succession event.  I think we covered the last two pretty well.  
**[0:38:43-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:38:43):**  So what are some of the lessons that learned from the 2000s?  I think you said 2007 to 2010 succession event and the 1963 incorporation that you've brought  on board and you're incorporating into your succession plan.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:39:02):**  So the 2010, when we finalized that it was a an obvious opportunity to have a discussion  with my dad.  Because we could have been back in the exact same situation, you know, 2025 or whatever  
**[0:39:20-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:39:20):**  2030.  And so I just sat down with him at some point, I think we were on a road trip or something.  And I said, look, I know this isn't comfortable to talk about.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:39:30):**  But if you want to do the exact same thing the same way, that's okay.  But I just need to know now, like, we need to communicate about this now, because I might  have to make some different decisions and, you know, sort of take my life in a little  
**[0:39:46-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:39:46):**  bit different path, or grow the business in a different way or whatever.  Because if I'm going to have 75% of it, because I've got three sisters as well.  If I'm going to take 75% of that and know that it's going to someone else, you know,  
**[0:40:01-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:01):**  we need to we need to figure that out.  And it's yours.  I think that's something that we all have to remember is that we always want to interject  
**[0:40:11-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:11):**  our own wants and desires or whatever.  But I was very concerned and still concerned.  Well, okay, Dad, what do you see?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:19):**  Where do you see this going?  Like, what do you want from this?  And so after we had that discussion, and it's tell the story in the school sometimes and  
**[0:40:29-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:29):**  everybody laughs and it is kind of funny because he said, Oh, I think that's we need to have  that discussion.  And he said, as far as I'm concerned, the ranch and the cows and the cattle business  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:39):**  should go to you.  Now you go work that out with your sisters.  And so Oh, great.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:46):**  Thanks, Dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:40:50-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:40:50):**  But my my sisters are great.  And so it was a tough conversation.  I had it over the phone with each of them and said, Look, you know, I understand how  
**[0:41:03-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:03):**  this looks.  But you understand how what we just went through looks, you know, you didn't think it was very  fair.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:11):**  So if if you don't think that's fair, is this a viable option?  If not, let's talk about it.  You know, it's kind of a speak now forever hold your peace, but but not exactly.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:25):**  And, and they all agreed, you know that?  No, that makes sense.  I said, Look, I could lose the whole thing.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:32):**  I could, I could run this deal on the ground and lose it.  And if I do, that's on me.  I could grow it, you know, I could could do crazy stuff with it.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:43):**  And if I do, that's on me.  You know, you guys have the next 30 years to do what you're going to do and live your  lives and, you know, with your spouses and everything else.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:41:53):**  And so the agreement that we made was that any of my mom's inheritance, and the you know,  the house and all of that stuff would be for my sisters, and they would stand to inherit  that, that I would inherit the ranch and cows.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:42:09):**  And I had I had some comments like, you know, about that, well, that sure came out smelling  like a rose or that that sure isn't fair or whatever.  And if people feel that way, so be it.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:42:23):**  But you know, that was sort of the deal that we set up.  And I intend to do something similar with my kids, but I'm thinking that it'll be more  sort of a buyback program or buy in and maybe that was the right thing to have done then.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:42:39):**  But that was before my RFP experience.  And I hadn't had my eyes open to a lot of things.  So I can't really tell you exactly what it's going to be.  
**[0:42:47-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:42:47):**  I think next week is going to be a lot of fun.  And going over a lot of this stuff that they kind of getting some ideas flowing.  Dave's the guy that we haven't had on the show, you'll have to tell him hi for me, we  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:02):**  need to get him we need to get our schedules together CK and get with Dave Pratt and recording  up.  He's great.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:08):**  I got to go.  I never got taught by Dave, but I got to go to Georgia to the school and observing for  two and a half days.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:18):**  It's it's crazy.  It's like makes you feel pretty incompetent yourself.  I love how blunt he is.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:24):**  I had to think of the one last school that he transitioned with Dallas was the one I  did with him.  And he just he just tells you how it is.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:32):**  And you're like, yeah, I needed to hear that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm probably not quite that brave.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:39):**  Not yet.  Anyways, you'll get there.  I had Dave for my instructor when I went way back in 2006.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:43:52):**  And I don't want to repeat the name that my dad had for him or what he used to refer to  him as I'm sure you can imagine.  You know, Dave's a unique guy.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:44:07):**  And I'm glad he was at the helm of RMC for as long as he was and helped develop the curriculum.  And I don't think that there's anybody better than Dallas to have it handed off to, you  know, and Dallas was my instructor when I went back.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:44:23):**  Well with you and was that 2019, fall of 2019?  Yeah, I think he's gonna do good things.  But anyway, this isn't a sales pitch for the school that shall not be named.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:44:35):**  Yeah, well, yeah, I know it's not, but if you go on a little bit more.  The deal that Dave did, like, this is like such a gift for me to be able to, I'm so blessed  to be able to like walk in and the tools and the curriculum and what he learned.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:44:56):**  And I don't think a lot of people know that, like Dave built like this amazing business  to be able to help people like me.  It wasn't like that.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:45:07):**  Got it.  You know, he, the stuff that he talks about, I mean, it's just, it blows my mind that over  a course of years, he did the walkie work to build RMC to the point where it was and  
**[0:45:20-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:45:20):**  just, you know, it's changed a lot of lives.  So it's pretty cool.  Stan Parsons, he had a lot of it.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:45:29):**  You know, he gave Dave a really great set of tools that Dave put in a new toolbox and  polished them all.  And even, yeah, he probably added a bunch of new ones too, but you know, it only continues  
**[0:45:44-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:45:44):**  to get better and it only continues to get better because you know, if people like you  and graduate support programs and people still being involved in giving feedback.  Yeah, it's a cool deal.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:45:59):**  So talk a little bit about this deal you're going to next week, the RMC for generations.  Yeah, yeah.  They're calling it a succession intensive and I think Dave's developed all the curriculum  
**[0:46:11-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:46:11):**  for it and it's going to be in, I got my ticket booked.  I've been traveling too much lately.  It's in Wyoming.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:46:20):**  It's going to be in Cheyenne.  And so it's three days and basically we're going to walk out of there with a draft succession  agreement and we're going to do family employment policies and you know, pretty much the whole  
**[0:46:35-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:46:35):**  gamut and the family business deal.  So it's going to be cool.  I think there's going to be a lot of people there that it's a pressing issue for them  
**[0:46:45-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:46:45):**  that they know they need to do something and they're looking for the tools to do it, you  know, so it may be in a different spot in their business than what I am, but it's just  going to give me a lot of stuff to plan for the future and to be working on.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:47:01):**  And then, you know, selfishly stuff that I can learn and pick up to be able to help other  people.  That's part of the reason why I'm going.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:47:14):**  So I kind of want to circle back a little bit and you've been through the whole undivided  interest situation and I know that's a very, very common thing.  So let's talk about it for a second.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:47:30):**  Do you have any advice for people that are in that sort of situation that they are, you  know, they're that 33% or 25% undivided interest or that's just the deal they're locked into.  What advice would you have for somebody in a situation like that?  
**[0:47:51-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:47:51):**  That's a great question.  It's so many different situations out there and there's so many different personalities  to work where people are closed off to certain things or where there's been some wedge of  
**[0:48:08-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:48:08):**  resentment that's been put in place and grown over the years with families.  But man, life is so short.  And that was the one thing, one of my aunts that really pushed to get this done, she and  
**[0:48:24-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:48:24):**  I had had a lot of phone calls together trying to work through this and see where each other  stood and she opened up to me a lot and I opened up to her.  And ultimately she just, this is a phase in her life to where this is what she wanted.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:48:40):**  She wanted a place to take her grandkids to.  It was her place that she could pass on to them.  And she passed away a few years after we closed the deal out and that was all she wanted.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:48:54):**  And thank God that we were able to do it and we didn't keep fighting over it and everything  else.  But if people can figure out what they really want and put aside the greed or the whole  
**[0:49:10-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:49:10):**  asset succession deal, then what do I ultimately want out of this?  And I think that's one side of it because pretty good chance everybody wants something  a little bit different.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:49:22):**  And maybe there's a situation, even if you're an undivided interest and this is the way  that it was set up, that we have a little give here and a little take here because I  want this and you want that, let's figure out how to make this work.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:49:35):**  I think the bigger problem is that sometimes those wedges of resentment that I was talking  about, the emotions overrule all of that stuff.  And some of those things, maybe you can't get through them and you just have to cut  
**[0:49:53-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:49:53):**  it and get over it.  But trying to work through those things and get into the deeper issues initially, I think,  and I've seen situations where there's apologies and forgiveness and that kind of stuff that's  
**[0:50:11-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:50:11):** ... These succession events can be a good thing because sometimes you can get all of  that out and get it over with.  But if you don't communicate, then usually they're a bad thing.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:50:23):**  So I don't know if I've really answered your question there, even though I tried, but-  Get to figure out why-  Say that what you want.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:50:31):**  And you get to find out why Uncle Frank was mad at Aunt Rita for the last 35 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're really, really, for the most part, really equipped to work through that stuff  
**[0:50:45-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:50:45):**  in a family because you're dealing with all those emotions.  You can't even sit down at a table and begin that conversation.  So there's a way that you can do that.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:50:56):**  That's huge.  Have you ever used the facilitator for any of those family conversations?  No, I mean, looking back, if we would have been on a Yale board and had no facilitation  
**[0:51:14-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:51:14):**  was available back in the day, that would have been amazing, I think.  But we weren't involved with the program yet.  I've done several ICAs for families and it's crazy how much stuff comes out during an ICA  
**[0:51:29-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:51:29):**  and how much of those emotions get laid out there.  It's a little bit tricky because a lot of people want to get down to the business of,  well, what do we need to do?  
**[0:51:43-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:51:43):**  What enterprises do we need to run, make money and turn this thing around and this and that.  The more I do it, the more I think that if we don't get to the root cause of some of  these personality issues or emotional things and scars, if we don't figure out what our  
**[0:52:01-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:01):**  purpose is, what the business's purpose needs to be, we can come up with a hundred ways  to make it profitable and make money.  But if you don't do it in a way that's fulfilling for the members and you don't do it in a way  
**[0:52:15-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:15):**  that helps you heal some of these relationships, then at the end of the day, what are you going  to have?  I guess, what's that song?  
**[0:52:23-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:23):**  It's a country song about money can't buy happiness, but it can buy.  Anyway, I'm terrible with music.  That's the second thing I couldn't remember today.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:39):**  I'm not that great with it.  No, I can't.  No, I'm going to Google it later.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:44):**  Yeah.  Anyway, you'll have the money, but you might not have anything else.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:49-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:52:49):**  No, I feel like, John, I feel like you're speaking to me right now because we've recently  moved home and we're dealing with a wedge of resentment because my husband finished  veterinary school and so some of his siblings are just showing their ugly, I don't know,  
**[0:53:05-0:53:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:05):**  emotions that they're resentful of him and his success.  And I'm like, wow, you had every opportunity to do this too.  But he's blaming me on family dynamics.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:14):**  And I'm like, oh, this is about, this is not about what I think it's about.  It's about a lot more other things of these scars that need to be healed.  And then you look at the layers and layers of what the actual why is.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:27):**  And so I say, like, I'd like to remind the family, just keep asking why.  And once you get to the fifth, why you actually understand what the problem is that needs  to be solved.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:38):**  But it's a struggle.  It's really hard to have these conversations because there's so many factors that you had  no idea.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:46):**  Oh, I had no idea that this was what this was about.  He threw my s'mores in the campfire when I was seven.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:54):**  Yeah.  Right.  It's like just little things like that.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:53:57):**  You're like, okay, let's figure it out though.  You know, I want to move forward to resolve this.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:54:04):**  And it's amazing how many times people put their own problems and insecurities on you.  You know, just just the fact that they were never brave enough to go out and, you know,  go to vet school or, or educate themselves, it makes them feel somehow, you know, it brings  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:54:25):**  that stuff to light.  And so then they turn around and they put it on somebody else.  And then when you get it put on you, then you react negatively.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:54:32):**  And it's just throwing fuel on the fire.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:54:37):**  And it's just, uh, just been quiet now.  Like, okay, let's just, let's just listen, listen to everyone else and, and not add fuel.  So definitely a conversation though.  
**[0:54:48-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:54:48):**  Cause like even with COVID, um, and I even think with all of us isolating ourselves and  having other health issues mentally and physically, I think about the health of my parents and  they communicated with me and my sisters, what they've wanted, but on the other side,  
**[0:55:07-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:07):**  my in-laws there's nine siblings and there's really no communication of what the succession  plan is.  And we've tried to bring it up a couple of times.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:17):**  Um, do you have any advice of like, do you just like, how do you break through and to  actually have that conversation where it doesn't come off as I don't at the end of the day,  I really don't want any assets.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:30):**  I don't want an interest.  I just want to know what you want at the end of the day.  And if you're in a position where you can't make those decisions or they can't be voiced,  
**[0:55:40-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:40):**  I want it to be known now so that we can help get what you want to succeed.  Yeah.  And I think, I think what you're talking about is absolutely the most common thing that we  
**[0:55:55-0:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:55):**  do.  You had that discussion, right?  With your dad.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:55:58):**  Uh, my, my situation's a little more simple.  Um, but we, we have a partnership purchase agreement.  Um, okay.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:56:09):**  We're working off of, so like, you know, I invest money, I buy shares out of, out of  partnership and you know, that's how I'm, that's how our succession plan is working  that, you know, I'm buying into the asset as we're going.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:56:26):**  I think, and this is just one strategy.  I think that you have to be direct and I'm guessing that you probably tried to be indirect,  but what questions you're asking and, and so do you want to pass this place in this  
**[0:56:44-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:56:44):**  business on and keep it intact?  Right.  And that's a yes or no question and pretty good chance that they're going to answer it  
**[0:56:53-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:56:53):**  as a yes.  Well, if that's what you want, you know, I'm guessing that we don't have the tools to do  that, but is that something that you want to work on something you want to do?  
**[0:57:06-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:57:06):**  Um, I don't know.  I think that the questions is where it's at and it's sometimes it's so hard to ask the  right question, but you can let somebody, you can shut somebody down with the question  
**[0:57:19-0:57:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:57:19):**  you ask or you can let them off the hook.  And one of the biggest things that I've learned recently is, is let them talk.  I know a lot of them don't want to talk.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:57:30):**  They just don't want to talk about it because they don't know what to do.  But if you can figure out a way to get them to talk and then, then listen, um, there's  probably an issue of fairness there.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:57:44):**  They feel like that, well, it's not fair if we do this or that.  And you already said that, you know, you don't feel like you, you deserve it or you want  it.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:57:53):**  So figuring out what's driving them and what's keeping the conversation.  Yeah.  So is equal fair and is fair equal?  
**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:58:07):**  What's the word fair mean?  Right.  What's normal mean?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:58:11):**  I mean, setting on a dryer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:58:17):**  It's in my mind, it goes back to the question that I just, just asked, what do you want?  So acknowledging from the beginning that it is theirs, it's their asset, their legacy.  And I like that question too.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:58:35):**  What do you see as your legacy?  Is it all the work that you've put into this place in this place?  Or is it the fact that you built a business and you figured out how to do this and you  
**[0:58:48-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:58:48):**  figured out how to do that, that pioneering spirit, you know, what is that legacy?  And so if you go to the person that owns the asset and has a legacy that, whether it's  the asset legacy or whether it's the legacy of their spirit and the stories that they  
**[0:59:09-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:09):**  want to have passed on, and you ask them, what do you want to have happen?  Do you want this to continue?  And they say, yes.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:17):**  Okay.  Well, if we split it up equally amongst nine errors, what is the likelihood of that happening?  It's not very good.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:29):**  Right.  And so my, I guess my place of concern and becoming in as an in-law too, I feel very  much like I shouldn't.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:37):**  Right.  But I also am a person and Brian knows this, I embrace conflict because once you embrace  conflict, that's how you resolve it.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:45):**  Right.  It's ignoring conflict makes it worse in my opinion.  Absolutely.  
**[0:59:49-1:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=0:59:49):**  So I'm the sister-in-law who embraces conflict.  And I do that with good intention.  So I think I say that with, I see this as a, as a point of weakness that will break  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:01):**  this family apart.  And I just want to prevent that from happening.  I want to be proactive about it.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:06):**  And I think even if that means my husband and I say, we don't want anything, but we  just want to help facilitate the success of a family and the long-term run, because we  both have careers.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:18):**  We don't really, I mean, we could do this on our own.  We don't need any of that kind of stuff.  And that's kind of the point we're trying to prove is I don't want to inherit shares  
**[1:00:28-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:28):**  or assets or even be on the wheel or the trust or whatever else, the business.  I just want to know what they want in writing.  So that's there in case we ever need it.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:39):**  Do you feel like that's been made clear to the rest of the family thus far?  I've talked to it.  I talked to him about it with some of the other siblings.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:00:53):**  It's just, it's just a really weird dynamic.  It's just I hope they don't listen to this podcast.  Honestly, I hope they do listen to it, but I don't think they do, but I, they're just  
**[1:01:04-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:04):**  a family who avoids conflict at all costs.  And so that's just I don't even think they think about it, to be honest, the other ones  I haven't talked to about it.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:15):**  Yeah.  And that's like you said, that that's a way to create so much more conflict by doing your  dead level.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:23):**  But what happens when you're grieving, you get angry, you feel entitled, everything,  other emotion floods you.  And so you're not even acting like I I've lost a brother when I was like 21 years old.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:38):**  And the things I did to my mom and my dad and my sisters, I've never seen them that  way.  And it's just, you never know how a person's going to react until something like that happens.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:50):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and maybe one suggestion could be is facilitating a meeting amongst the potential  
**[1:01:59-1:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:01:59):**  heirs without.  Yeah, that's a good idea, actually.  Yeah.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:02:04):**  Just say, Hey, look, we're really concerned about this.  And we feel like that there's no telling what could happen.  And, and we want to see it passed on.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:02:16):**  But this is our position.  We're not doing this because we want to have it passed on to us.  But if there's somebody in this room, the right person to lead this business going forward,  
**[1:02:27-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:02:27):**  we want to help facilitate that.  And by everybody doing nothing, that's not gonna happen.  Yeah.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:02:36):**  Well, john, we got some time left.  You want to talk about your cows a little bit?  I'm talking about my cows.  
**[1:02:45-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:02:45):**  So what do you learn about your brahmin cows?  The only bovine species that I know of that actually, well, I shouldn't say that.  But I do say it anyway, that they have a soul.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:03:01):**  None of the other breeds of cattle.  There's, it's like the lights are on.  But nobody's home.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:03:08):**  It's, it's funny.  So I'm sorry, but those are the biggest puppy dog breed ever.  So I had a young man in the school Canadian, who's transplanted to Texas and Kennewick  
**[1:03:28-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:03:28):**  a couple weeks ago.  And somebody started talking about Brahmins.  And you know, all the crazy Brahmins this and that.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:03:37):**  And he said, I didn't have to say it, thank goodness, because I would have, he said, Brahmins  are absolutely the most honest cattle you will ever be around.  As far as stockmanship is concerned.  
**[1:03:51-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:03:51):**  If you don't, if you're not a good stockman, and you don't know what you're doing, or they've  been around somebody previously that was a human and not a good stockman, you could have  problems.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:04:02):**  But they're, they're really, really honest, and they're highly intelligent.  And, you know, I've petted a Hereford before, I don't want to admit that in front of too  many people.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:04:13):**  I think I've probably maybe petted an Angus, but it's, it's not the same, like the personality,  good or bad.  They're just a breed of cattle with a lot of personality.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:04:28):**  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I was, I was actually with one of my good friends today, we're riding around, we're  
**[1:04:35-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:04:35):**  talking about Tiger Stripes, which is, you know, a Brahma Bull on a Hereford cow.  And, you know, I don't know if it's one of those things that was a fad once, and it's  just coming back around again.  
**[1:04:48-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:04:48):**  Or if it's, or if it's people are just starting to rediscover something else that works.  I seen some Tiger Stripes grow up here in my country, and they, they do really well,  they don't necessarily handle the nicest in the world.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:02):**  But that might have been from some of their previous exposure to other people's stockmanship.  Right?  You know, they gained well, and they looked really good on the native forage without much  
**[1:05:13-1:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:13):**  supplement.  Yeah.  So they're that, that's 90% of the reason to have Brahmins on the face of this earth  
**[1:05:23-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:23):**  is you know that ever bigger that you can get.  And it's not just Tiger Stripes, the Brahmin Angus F1 is amazing too.  But I'm sure there's something that's more opposite than a Brahmin and a Hereford.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:38):**  But when you take something that different, and you put it together, which not going to  knock, I should probably spend the next 10 minutes knocking Angus because my Hereford  friends are going to get mad and think I'm knocking Hereford.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:51):**  But Hereford's, you know, obviously, there's issues with that breed, like there isn't ever.  Absolutely.  So I'm going to say it now.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:05:58):**  So they can't get too mad.  There's tons of issues with Brahmins.  But you can put those two breeds together and get the most magnificent creature that  
**[1:06:08-1:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:06:08):**  will out gain, out grow, out produce, out milk, almost anything out there.  I mean, they're, they're phenomenal.  You get more of everything.

And I wouldn't guarantee you that that was all handling.  There's some of that that's natural and inherent.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:06:26):**  But and it could come from the Hereford side just as much as it could come from the Brahmin  side.  But they're amazing.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:06:33):**  The Brahmin Angus F1 is amazing as well.  If you have if you had 500 Hereford cows, and you put Brahmin bulls on them, and you  raised F1s, and you had 500 Angus cows, and you put Brahmin bulls on them, and you raised  
**[1:06:51-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:06:51):**  F1s from them, it's my opinion that across the board, you're probably going to make more  money and be more consistent with the Brahmin Angus F1.  But you're going to ring the bell with the Brahmin Hereford Tiger Strike.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:04):**  I mean, you take them to a sale or you sell them in the country or whatever, they're going  to bring more money, but they're going to be more consistent, probably be a little bit  more likely to have other problems, and probably have a little more disposition.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:19):**  Well, people in y'all's country, if you're a cow calf guy, you really should be running  a quarter Brahmin something.  Because you get most of that benefit, and you don't get the you get a little more cold  
**[1:07:32-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:32):**  tolerance, and you don't get the quite as much disposition.  And when you take something out of that quarter blood cow and sell it, there's probably no  detectable ear in it whatsoever.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:43):**  So you're not going to pick up any dock on.  Right.  Even the quarter bullets, really, the quarter bullets are going to sell pretty well.  
**[1:07:55-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:55):**  But you got to get there first.  You got to go through the half bloods first.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:07:59):**  Yeah, you're right.  And we used to sell quite a few F1 bulls, Brahmin Hereford bulls.  I haven't been doing it lately.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:08:09):**  It was enterprise.  I started a while back.  But you could take that F1 bull, put it on an Angus cow.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:08:15):**  And I've got people up kind of, you know, Oklahoma, Missouri that had bought some of  those bulls and were raising quarter bloods.  You lose a little consistency, but man, they're sure, sure good cattle.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:08:26):**  You get a lot more longevity.  You start to think about cow depreciation and what that costs you.  You get 25% more longevity with a quarter blood.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:08:36):**  That's worth a lot of money.  I think about cow depreciation every day when I look at my cows.  Yeah, scary.  
**[1:08:47-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:08:47):**  Well, you know, I didn't buy mine for a whole lot more than what they're worth depreciated  out or salvage value.  They just had a calf with them.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:00):**  So I got a little bit different perspective on cow depreciation than the guy that goes  and buys a pen full of $2,000 heifers.  What about a cow you could sell for 5,000?  
**[1:09:13-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:13):**  She pounds out at 600.  What's that depreciation look like?  Pretty good.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:21):**  Yeah, pretty ugly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:25):**  So is there a, is there anything you want to get off your chest that we haven't covered  today, John?  Man, I don't know.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:37):**  You said we were going to talk about succession and people and you feel like I've covered  adequately all those things.  When's the next session that you're teaching?  
**[1:09:51-1:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:09:51):**  Do you have one scheduled?  Yes, I'm teaching Phoenix and it's December the, it's like the eighth through the, it's  that second week.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:04):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd rather be wanting to get away.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:08):**  I'll put a link in the show notes page to the schedule for the school that shall not  be named.  I'm sorry.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:16):**  Since I, since I get to do Phoenix and enjoy the beautiful warm weather in December, my  punishment is having to do my knot in February or late January.  So when I said that I'm learning to embrace the cold, I'm going to come in handy.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:40):**  You acclimate a little.  I think you'll learn a whole new type of cold at my knot North Dakota in February.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:48-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:48):**  I might not, I might not embrace that very well.  It'll make what happened down there in February look like a normal summer day.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:10:59):**  Yeah.  No.  I just, I appreciate you having me on and you know, appreciate what you guys are doing.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:11:08):**  You've got a great podcast and there's so much, so much information out there these  days that to kind of challenge some of those old paradigms and you know, we're operating  in a tough environment.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:11:22):**  I'm not talking about me specifically, but I'm talking about ranchers in general.  Yeah.  And we got to stick together and we got to challenge ourselves and it's you know, it's  
**[1:11:36-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:11:36):**  so much you can do with your management to be profitable and try to reach that higher  quality life.  And it just, I don't know.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:11:48):**  I appreciate what you guys are doing is what I'm trying to say, because there's a lot of  people that are just like, Hey, this is the life we chose and we're just gonna tough it  out.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:11:58):**  And I'm not all for that.  You know, it's life is short.  You want something to go out there and get it.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:12:06):**  Yeah.  Thanks for that, John.  You know, I don't want to, I don't want to speak for you CK, but you know, I don't, I  
**[1:12:12-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:12:12):**  have a lot of fun doing it.  You know, I got to have a lot of cool conversations with my friends.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:12:18):**  You know, and we're always learning stuff and you know, sharing and spreading the knowledge  is part of it.  You know, if, if we aren't willing to embrace our failures and share the lessons that we've  
**[1:12:31-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:12:31):**  learned, other people are doomed to repeat those mistakes.  And, you know, things are changing so fast.  We've seen so much change in the last 18 months, you know, in, in the beef industry, in communications,  
**[1:12:49-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:12:49):**  in government.  And there it's a really fascinating time to be alive because there's so many things changing  so fast.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:13:02):**  And you know, in some ways I feel pretty lucky that, you know, I live out here in the country,  you know, like, you know, the rest of us do, and we have the benefit of this modern technology  and we get a direct periscope into what's going on anywhere we want in the world.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:13:19):**  Yes.  And it's, it's just fascinating to see all the change taking place and, you know, people  starting to ask questions about where their food comes from and what sprayed on it.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:13:30):**  You know, that being able to, being able to have consumers directly connect with producers  through this miracle of the internet, you know, it's a fascinating time to be alive.  Yeah, it really is.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:13:44):**  It's it kind of brings to mind for me that that quote, I don't even know where it came  from, but the guy that was in the horse and buggy business at the turn of the century,  what happened to his business?  
**[1:13:59-1:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:13:59):**  But the guy that was in the transportation business could be the same guy, you know,  and that's what I keep challenging myself to, to, you know, keep looking at this business,  keep looking at what we're doing and keep figuring out, you know, what is it, what what's  
**[1:14:15-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:14:15):**  at the core?  And it's, it's, so I don't want to get off on a soapbox, but you know, a lot of people  look at what we do and they say, Oh yeah, you got reputation, worldwide reputation and  
**[1:14:28-1:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:14:28):**  this and that.  And it's so easy and all that, but that, that just builds some strong, strong paradigms  about the way that you should be operating in the way that you should be functioning.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:14:40):**  And so that's what I keep trying to challenge myself on is that, you know, what are we in  the horse and buggy business or are we in the transportation business?  What is at the core?  
**[1:14:51-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:14:51):**  What do I need to be doing for my family, for my land, for my livestock to be able to  keep going in this challenging environment?  Am I in the cattle business?  
**[1:15:02-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:15:02):**  Am I in the land business?  Am I in the ecosystem services and benefits business or am I in the energy business?  That's what I've started telling people that lately is like about sit down on an airplane  
**[1:15:18-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:15:18):**  next to somebody, which can't hardly talk to you these days with a mask on, but like,  so what do you do?  You know, typically, well, I'm in the cattle business and I've started telling people I'm  
**[1:15:29-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:15:29):**  an energy management specialist and they're like, Oh, tell me more about that.  And you know, I'm trying to manage my energy and the people I have around me to harvest  energy from the sun and turn it into money.  
**[1:15:43-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:15:43):**  And there's a lot of different ways to do that.  So but when you've got six generations in a family business and operating in the same  environment like we've been doing, it's scary and fun to start challenging some of those  
**[1:16:01-1:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:01):**  paradigms thinking, okay, well, what does my family look like a hundred years from now?  So it's a little bit scary, but you know, that's the way we all better be looking at  it, I think.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:15):**  Oh yeah.  Making better decisions for the long term, making sure we leave it a little bit better  for the next generation.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:24):**  Yes, sir.  I think that's probably a pretty good place to wrap up.  CK, do you have anything else?  
**[1:16:33-1:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:33):**  We may need to get back in the horse and buggy business though, if this world keeps turning  the way it is.  That's true.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:42):**  That's true.  No, that's all I have.  Okay.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/32-John-Coleman-Locke-Just-find-a-method-to-communicate-e17tr4m#t=1:16:47):**  John, we appreciate you joining us today.  Yes, sir.  Thank you guys for having me.

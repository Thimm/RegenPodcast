**[0:00:34-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:00:34):**  Hey gang, welcome to episode 41 of Ranching Reboot.  Following last week's detour to dairy grazing on the coast of Maine, this week we are going  to go all the way down to south Texas and talk to a vegetable farmer friend of mine.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:00):**  Before we get into the episode this week, I wanted to let you know that I am running  a couple polls in the Ranching Reboot Paddock Facebook group.  Every vote matters and they will all be counted.

One more thing, if you haven't shared one of our past episodes, I'd ask that you do  that this week with somebody that you think might help.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:19):**  Without any more gum flapping from me, here's this week's episode with Tyler Froberg.  Hello Tyler, will you be joining us?  How are you doing?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:27):**  Doing good.  Will you join us on video today?  Yes, I will.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:30):**  I'm sorry, I'm in my truck and I hope that's alright.  That's okay, as long as you've got time for us today.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:39):**  We've been very excited about this, trying to figure out the best way.  I used to have one of those truck mounts.  Oh yeah, those things are nice.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:01:53):**  It gets so hot here.  One day I came in and it just decided it wasn't going to work for me no more.  So here we are.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:01):**  Where are you located out of Tyler?  Actually I'm not familiar with where you're from.  Yeah, so I am in the Texas Gulf Coast.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:08):**  So I'm south of Houston in Victoria County.  The birthplace of Texas, actually.  Absolutely.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:17):**  Was in Goliad and we toured not where Alamo happened, but the other...  Yeah, the Battle of Goliad.  Yeah, there you go.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:30):**  Oh my God, are we done?  Okay.  Yeah, no, you just really learned about all the Texas history and the six flags and the...  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:41):**  What's the one with the arm?  What's it called?  The flag with the red arm?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:45):**  The body arm?  I'm going to look it up.  I'll have to look that one up.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:02:52):**  I don't know that one either, I think.  It was like a sign to General Santa Ana that the people of Goliad would rather cut off  their right arm than like surrender to them.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:06):**  Wow.  Yeah, I'm not clear with that one.  I'll have to go look back at that one.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:11):**  I'm going to Google it real quick.  It's nice to meet you.  I'm CQ, by the way.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:15):**  I'm out of Idaho, so I'm freezing and you're probably really hot.  So we're at 79 degrees today.  Yeah, and super humid, right?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:24):**  I was just in Victoria, Texas.  I think that's kind of close to you guys.  That's just south of me.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:30):**  Yep.  Yeah.  Pretty, pretty humid.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:33):**  We hit like, we had almost 75 today, but it was also 31 when the sun came up this morning.  Right.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:42):**  Not that quite cold.  I mean, we were in the fifties this morning, but you know, it's the humidity, that moisture  in the air really holds the heat through the night.  
**[0:03:51-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:03:51):**  That's what it's honestly for our summers, they wouldn't be as bad if we cooled off at  night, but we don't.  We're still 90 something degrees at night because that humidity holds onto that air.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:04:03):**  It's miserable.  That's what a lot of our summers are like too, especially the early part of the summer.  If we're having a pretty decent year for moisture, we're getting a lot of late spring, early  
**[0:04:14-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:04:14):**  summer, and that carries in.  We keep all that humidity, which it's pretty tolerable till you wake up in the morning  and it's 85 and you know it's going to be like 105, 107.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:04:27):**  That's pretty miserable when it's 85 degrees and that's the coolest it gets all day.  But I probably shouldn't complain because I'm not on Texas Gulf Coast.  So, what do you do down there on the Texas Gulf Coast, Tyler?  
**[0:04:44-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:04:44):**  Great question.  So, I am a diversified vegetable farmer.  Now there's a long story on what led me to where I am right now.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:05:02):**  It dates back about 85 years ago and so my family migrated from Germany in about 1901  and started farming in the Brazoria County area.  Then in 1936, so roughly 85 years ago, my family bought the property that they're still  
**[0:05:20-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:05:20):**  on and they've been raising fruit and vegetables there ever since.  The operation has seen changes through the years.  Starting from citrus to figs, blackberries, strawberries.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:05:35):**  Then strawberries are what we're most known for.  So in today's time, if you were to come to Alvin, Texas and take a trip to Froberg's  farm, you would more than likely be going to do a you pick session, whether that be  
**[0:05:49-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:05:49):**  for strawberries or blackberries or flowers or go through a corn maze or what have you.  But through the years, the operation, like I said, has been a multitude of things, including  wholesaling to H-E-B-E, keeping our grocery store stocked.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:03):**  My family's got a huge store on the property.  It started off as a fruit stand.  So kind of what you would think of as a truck farmer, most people are familiar with that  
**[0:06:13-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:13):**  term.  So think of a truck farmer that evolved with the times.  So a family of truck farmers that said, we're not stopping, we're going to keep trying to  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:23):**  go at it.  That's pretty rare.  It is.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:27):**  Truck farms were kind of a dime a dozen, 80s, not even in through the 90s.  But the early 2000s saw a huge, huge dip in these operations, especially as grocery stores  began to get bigger.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:42):**  And you started to see grocery stores in places you didn't see grocery stores before.  And the truck farmer definitely declined.  But my journey kind of took a left turn.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:06:54):**  So after high school, I joined the army.  I knew that I really wanted to go to college.  And so I knew to do that, I would have to have somebody pay for it.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:07:08):**  And I was a middle ground student, you know, FFA and 4-H really, that occupied my mind,  my grades.  Not that I was a bad student, but I definitely wasn't like a great student.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:07:21):**  And so it's more fun to grow strawberries than it is to learn about history, I'm sure.  Yeah, you go.  Everybody always jokes that most of us brought strawberries to our teachers to make sure  
**[0:07:34-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:07:34):**  that we got good grades.  I will neither confirm nor deny that theory.  So served four years in the army, came back home and kind of did what I was supposed to  
**[0:07:45-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:07:45):**  do, worked on the family farm.  You know, after being home for a little while, I was 3 a.m. to 7 p.m. 365 days a year.  So that's roughly 120 something hours a week.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:08:00):**  Just really, it was tough, you know, and anyone involved in the industry knows that that's  the way it is, especially here where you're growing produce in an area that doesn't freeze.  So we grow year round, 365 days of growing.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:08:19):**  And so I kind of had to take a step back and I made the decision that I was going to go  and go to school.  And so I went and received my bachelor's and plant and soil science from Texas Tech University.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:08:32):**  I majored in plant and soil science and minored in agricultural leadership.  And so from then, I kind of had a decision to make.  What was I going to do with this?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:08:41):**  I now went to college and got me an education, as they say.  And so I decided I was going to become an ag teacher.  And so our local school district where I graduated from had a farm manager position open, is  
**[0:08:55-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:08:55):**  what they called it.  And so where I live, the school district has about an 80 acre production farm where they  do hay and raise some commercial cows owned by the district.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:04):**  And they do breeding goats for the kids and stuff.  And then they have to show barns.  So they have several positions that run those farms.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:11):**  And so I got something else in mind when you said school farm.  But that's the Utopian vision.  We come back to that later.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:19):**  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  I think I know where you're going with that, but we'll come back to that.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:25):**  So I did that.  And then there was a vacancy open.  And so I was lucky because Alvin ISD, where I taught, was known as a district on the rise,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:37):**  which means they emphasized CTE.  They emphasized the trades.  And so career and technical education is what CTE stands for.  
**[0:09:47-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:09:47):**  And so what that means is as long as you had at least 10 years experience in the industry,  you're going to be teaching and you had a bachelor's in that industry and you didn't  need a teacher certification, they could do what's called a local certification.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:10:01):**  Basically say we've investigated this individual.  They have enough industry knowledge that we're going to allow them to teach these subjects.  So I found myself in the classroom, which was a weird place to be for someone in the  
**[0:10:14-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:10:14):**  industry.  There's a lot of really, really great ag teachers.  But when you see young teachers, you generally they don't have industry experience.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:10:24):**  And so it was an interesting place to be, especially with a program that was heavy animal  science, which we see a lot across not just the state of Texas, but kind of the nation  as a whole, anywhere where there's and it's generally heavy animal science.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:10:39):**  So me coming in as a plant guy, try to bring a lot of things to that program.  And we had a lot of fun, a lot of accomplishments, learned a lot, not just about, you know, teaching  and wrangling high school kids, but about myself.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:10:53):**  But there I got recruited.  And so there was a nonprofit farm in the area that had just received a grant from the USDA  to start the grant was called the Ag Vet Grant.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:07):**  And essentially it was used to start a veteran training program.  So taking fellow vets and bringing them to the farm and teaching them how to grow food.  And so the position funded essentially the farm manager and the person who is going to  
**[0:11:22-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:22):**  be teaching.  So they said, look, we've looked high and low.  We've been looking for someone who was an ag teacher, who was a farmer and who was a  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:31):**  veteran.  And so when you kind of check all those boxes, there's only a few people locally.  They said, would you be interested?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:39):**  And this was spring break of that year that I left teaching.  And I said, no, I said, I love teaching.  I'm never going to leave teaching.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:46):**  Well, that summer came around and my wife and I just had a baby.  I was running the rodeos and livestock shows and all that.  I kind of took a step back and said, you know, maybe I should go talk to these people.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:11:59):**  So I did.  I took a step back and said, hey, would you all this position so open?  And they said yes.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:12:05):**  And so I went and checked out the farm and I loved it.  Right.  I realized, like production ag is where I wanted to be.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:12:13):**  And so I started running Hope Farms and it was awesome.  What year was that?  That would have been 2018.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:12:22):**  OK, 2018.  And so in my in my time at the farm, I had a great time.  I mean, learned at this specific farm, we were we were growing small scale organic produce.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:12:37):**  And so I learned a lot about small scale organic produce, learned a lot about the direct to  consumer models.  So marketing your produce, which that's how my family had traditionally done it.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:12:51):**  Definitely dove a lot into making the sale myself.  And everything that comes with that.  But as the time as time went on, I kind of found myself understanding that the grant  
**[0:13:07-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:13:07):**  position had or it was a grant funded position.  So the grant had a an expiration date.  And knowing that we would slowly but surely creep towards that expiration date and the  
**[0:13:20-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:13:20):**  farm probably wasn't going to be able to keep me after that.  I went ahead and made the decision, you know, there's someone at the farm who had the ability  to run it, who is looking to really start their career off.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:13:29):**  And so I made the decision to go and leave.  And my my wife and I through the years have been purchasing our own ground and just kind  of either leasing it or kind of letting it sit dormant until we were ready and finally  
**[0:13:45-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:13:45):**  decided we're ready.  And so here we are.  Now there was one small thing and how all of us met each other in between all of that  
**[0:13:55-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:13:55):**  happening.  And so when I left teaching, went to farming full time, I realized quickly on that I missed  the connection that I had with students.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:14:05):**  And so as an ag teacher, you quickly learn it doesn't matter if it's a seed germinating,  a chicken hatching or pulling a calf.  There's a teenager with their there with you.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:14:16):**  Their eyes are going to be the size of 50 cent pieces and it's going to be I mean, stars  in the sky and they're going to be into it no matter what it is.  New life.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:14:24):**  There's just something about it.  And so I said it's going to be too hard to try to bring kids to the farm.  So why don't I try to bring the farm to the kids?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:14:37):**  And that's where I made the farmer Froberg TikTok account, which has like six hundred  thousand followers, probably one of the most popular ag guys.  Oh, thank you.  
**[0:14:50-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:14:50):**  That means a lot.  And so what started, you know, I get lots of questions about TikTok a lot.  And so what started as an account to try to, you know, hey, guys, remember, like Mr. Froberg  
**[0:15:03-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:15:03):**  is still here and plants are still cool.  And it kind of evolved into what you see today, I developed several series that have kind  of become what I do.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:15:17):**  So five gardening tips from a vegetable farmer and then five farm facts where I generally  bring other producers in as a collaboration effort with, of course, the random silliness  in between.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:15:32):**  And that's what that's what led us here today.  And so what I do today is, of course, developing my own property to to be growing direct to  consumer produce.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:15:46):**  And then in the middle of all of that, I met Noah Young, who you all might be familiar  with.  He's Shiloh Farm on TikTok and various other places.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:15:57):**  Noah and I know is in Nebraska.  And Noah and I began to have these conversations and him and I were on the same page where  we wanted to start a business.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:06):**  And it was like we have these these accounts.  What do we do with them?  You know, we work really, really hard.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:14):**  I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, but if you've ever tried to create content,  you know, you work really, really hard to do this.  And it's like, what do I do?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:24):**  Creating Internet content is hard.  And then so you do it, you know, you do a decent job at it a few times and you gain,  you know, people who rely on watching that.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:36):**  And that's like, OK, now what do I do with this?  I've committed time to this.  People value it.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:42):**  So how do I how do I turn that into something?  And so Noah and I had many conversations and we knew several things.  We knew that, A, we were both passionate about the ag industry and kind of collaborating  
**[0:16:54-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:16:54):**  and supporting other agricultural producers.  We knew that we really like to be goofy on the Internet.  And we knew that we both wanted to remain in the ag industry, even if we didn't remain  
**[0:17:07-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:17:07):**  doing what we were doing, if that meant we were going to use our audiences.  You know, in a positive way.  And so we came up with Good Living.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:17:17):**  And so that's what our business name and our motto is, taste the simple life.  And so what Good Living is, is our effort to buy farm fresh, shelf stable products directly  from either ourselves or other producers and then market them as such.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:17:37):**  So as a high value farm fresh product to our audiences.  And so, you know, it's been we've we've we've been launched for about seven months now.  So we launched at the end of spring this year.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:17:56):**  We spent about six months trying to get launched.  Then we launched at the end of spring.  So all in all, we've been working on it for about a year now.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:18:04):**  And so far, so good.  You know, every every week we look for feedback every week.  We look for things that we can improve on.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:18:12):**  We look for, of course, new products, new farmers to work with.  And and yeah, it's going good.  We most recently launched our Texas olive oil, which our our buddy, our friend Mike  
**[0:18:25-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:18:25):**  is the farmer.  He raises all the olives in Uvalde, Texas, and then it's all olive farming in Texas.  It sounds in California where you have olives you have on the coast, you have the strawberries  
**[0:18:38-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:18:38):**  and it's like they're all just very similar now.  When we look at so the whole idea is that we are latitudinally.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:18:52):**  It's the Mediterranean.  And so are about like I think it's 250 miles off or something like that.  But it's close enough where you can get an orchard established for a good amount of time  
**[0:19:04-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:19:04):**  before it gets hit with something.  Yeah.  And so all Texas olive oil specifically, especially in Texas, you know how we Texans are absolutely  
**[0:19:15-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:19:15):**  as became a really, really high value niche market.  And so all of our olive oil is cold pressed.  We do have five flavors, including our extra virgin.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:19:27):**  The other four flavors, the things are the items are called the flavors are cold pressed  with the oil.  And so, for example, our hatch chili peppers.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:19:35):**  It's not it's not made from a hatch extract.  It's made it's called the olives are cold pressed, which with hatch peppers.  OK.  
**[0:19:42-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:19:42):**  And in that venture, we supported two farmers.  And and we know and I will never stop being producers.  And so with that, we have vowed to decrease our margins to ensure that our producers,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:04):**  our growers, our farmers, our ranchers, what have you get paid more and that our.  Sounds like you might have listened to a couple of our podcast episodes about it more profit  back to the farmer ranch.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:16):**  Kate, either that or all thinking the same thoughts.  Either way, it's great.  Oh, so.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:24):**  Yeah, that's that's been our goal.  And like I said, so so far, so good.  Every week we we gain new customers every week.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:34):**  We expand our horizons a little more.  This was something that in the beginning, for example, we had kind of pledged that we  would just do e-commerce.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:43):**  And now all of a sudden we're going to markets on the weekends and marketing it locally,  too, which is been huge for us as far as advertising goes, just getting markets or something that  him and I are both familiar with, extremely familiar with, but getting these products  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:20:59):**  into the market and getting local awareness.  Right.  It's big.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:21:05):**  So it the subjects come up before of direct marketing and e-commerce in relation to farmers  markets.  And a lot of what I've been hearing from friends that are in my area about farmers markets  
**[0:21:19-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:21:19):**  is, yeah, they're great.  Not for sales, but for advertising like the farmers markets lead to future sales that  build on each other.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:21:30):**  And it's a marketing opportunity.  But don't go to the farmers market thinking you're going to unload a crap load of product  because that's probably just not going to happen.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:21:37):**  Is that is that kind of your experience?  Especially so here's my deal with produce specifically is produce is not shelf stable.  And so if we go to a farmer's market, we better have the support.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:21:50):**  Right.  Or we're going to have a chef on standby who's going to take it all when we're done because  taking a band full of farm fresh produce that's not shelf stable.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:00):**  And then it sits out for or some of it sits out for 12 hour, 10 hour, however long you're  at the market.  And at the end of the day, you're like, you know, it's not.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:11):**  And I suppose the same goes with meat if you know if it's on display.  But you know, some of these other people, their products are frozen or what have you.  That's one of the reasons that we made the decision to kind of go with more shelf stable  
**[0:22:21-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:21):**  products.  It's easier to organize shipping and distribution and all those things.  So what are some examples of shelf sale products?  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:31):**  I mean, you said olive oil, honey, obviously.  I mean, that's like that's super easy.  What are some of the other ones?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah.  Herbal.  Jellies, jams, any type of preservatives.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:50):**  Fermented products.  So not, you know, any any of your fermented produce that's becoming huge right now.  Our crowd.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:22:57):**  Yeah.  Things like that.  Now, what in the all be the first ones to hear this.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:01):**  We've kind of been keeping a secret.  So this is a good living exclusive.  We are also working on our where the simple lifeline.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:10):**  And so oftentimes we only think of farm fresh as as edible things as food.  And so we want to change people's mindset on that.  Farm fresh can be anything that comes off the farm.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:21):**  And so this includes clothing.  And so right now we're working on our good live and where the simple lifeline of fresh  wool that's been handspun, hand knitted, you know, beanies, scarves, mittens, things like  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:35):**  that's what we're going to start with.  I love that.  That's all.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:38):**  Yeah.  And so, again, kind of changing the mindset of.  Of what farm fresh actually means, you know.  
**[0:23:49-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:23:49):**  That's terrific.  So the question now that comes up is if you're trying to market nonperishable items that  are produced on farm and just kind of being a pass through for the farmer, what what's  
**[0:24:05-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:24:05):**  kind of required, like in terms of maybe a kitchen or certifications just to keep the  Texas food police off your back?  Yes, that's a great, great question.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:24:17):**  Now I will say I stay away from perishable and nonperishable only because when people  think that in terms of marketing, they think that something's been sitting on the shelf  for a very long time.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:24:28):**  And I always like to start the conversation with all of our olive oil is used from the  last harvest.  We don't gold press and it has to sell that year.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:24:39):**  Nothing's going to be sold any time after that.  If we were going to do that, then my recommendation would just be go buy olive oil off the shelf,  you know.  
**[0:24:47-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:24:47):**  And so we like to use shelf stable because it says that, okay, this isn't going to go  bad in a day, but it doesn't give the marketing feel of something that A has a ton of preservatives  in it and B has been sitting in a warehouse for three years before we ship it to you.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:06):**  And so what was your question?  Repeat your question.  I'm sorry.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:12):**  Kitchens.  Kitchens and food police.  Oh, food police.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:15):**  Yeah.  So now everyone we've worked with thus far is we're talking fully inspected facilities.  Now we've already ran into, we've already ran through the scenario of what are we going  
**[0:25:31-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:31):**  to do whenever I'm ready?  I grew all my own peppers, my own super hots, and we're going to do some fermented hot sauce.  What we're going to use is a ghost kitchen.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:43):**  So we're going to use a facility that's already prepared to do something like this at midnight  when they're shut down, we're going to pay them a fee.  We're going to be able to go in there and work and use their facility.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:25:52):**  It's going to pass all of all those requirements.  Okay.  Behind the scenes is their stuff.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:00):**  That's pretty popular now though, right?  Like just kitchen space.  You still have cottage laws and these homesteading laws and all that.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:12):**  But really those are more geared in most places.  Those are going to be more geared towards you're either selling directly off the farm  or selling at a farmer's market type scenario.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:25):**  When you start talking about e-commerce and they, could we slide under the radar?  Of course.  Are we going to though?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:32):**  No, we're going to still do things by the book.  And oftentimes what that can look like is if it's a product that has to be processed  and the farmers or the producer isn't doing all of it, then we'll figure out how to do  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:45):**  it.  We'll figure out how to get it from the farmer to someone who that can do the processing  or what have you.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:52):**  Always call her good buddy, Russell Hedrick.  That guy knows how to play.  If he can figure out how to do anything.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:26:57):**  I mean, he put a grain mill in a cargo trailer.  Yep, exactly.  And so, yeah, so that brings up the next thing is we haven't fully hammered out all the details  
**[0:27:09-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:09):**  with Regen Mills, but we will more than likely be partnering with Regen Mills to kind of  to pair our missions.  Our mission is very much in line and yeah, we'll definitely be partnering.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:21):**  Excuse me.  We'll definitely be partnering with them on something.  Okay.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:27):**  So now I kind of got to, I'm going to have to throw a little curve ball at you here.  Bring it on.  So we're talking about, you know, getting involved for us on, you know, our good friends  
**[0:27:36-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:36):**  at Regen Mills.  You mentioned just as a couple of years ago that, you know, you're really into production  agriculture.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:44):**  So where are you at on the regenerative agriculture to conventional spectrum, I guess?  Yeah.  And which way are you moving?  
**[0:27:55-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:27:55):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  The operation that I just left was, you know, we were growing organic produce in the most  regenerative way possible.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:06):**  You know, obviously regenerative practices can be implemented, right?  There's all this talk about like, what is regenerative?  And we all know.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:15):**  Okay.  How do you define regenerative?  How do you define regenerative?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:19):**  Just so we have context for the conversation.  Yeah.  And so for me, when people ask me that, my general response is we implement regenerative  
**[0:28:28-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:28):**  practices in areas that we have the ability to do so.  You know, I pay respects to everyone's operation.  I grew up in a conventional farming family.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:39):**  So the produce that my family raises is conventionally raised.  However, the recent years, there has been transitions, for example, anywhere where the  corn maze is going every year, they my uncle really got into pasture raised broilers.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:28:53):**  And so they're running the chicken tractors across that area prior to that.  And so when most people would look at my family's operation, they're not going to label it a  regenerative practice or a regenerative operation.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:29:05):**  However, when you start peeling back the blinders and actually looking at the nitty gritty there,  there can't there are regenerative practices that can be found within this conventional  operation.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:29:17):**  Now that's not necessarily where I stand, but that's what I like to tell people where  I stand is the operation that I just left found, we found interesting ways to grow small  scale produce using organic and regenerative practice practices and marketing it in a way  
**[0:29:33-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:29:33):**  that we can get a more higher value product.  So selling to chefs using a CSA model for the direct to consumer produce.  That's hard to do with produce, right?  
**[0:29:49-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:29:49):**  When we start talking regenerative ag, that's, that's a hard thing to do with produce.  And so for me, it's about understanding your operations needs and being a good steward  of the land and really, really understanding regenerative practices and where they could  
**[0:30:10-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:30:10):**  be implemented on your own operation.  It's not like I'm expecting to run cows and sheep through your vegetable fields.  How are you getting fertility back?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:30:22):**  And if you say that you're using chemical fertilizer, I'm not going to yell at you.  Trust me.  No, no.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:30:28):**  And so no, the operation that I just left, we did not.  And so you know, when we start talking, so we get this question a lot.  And so in a market garden setting it's, it's a lot easier to do stuff like what you're  
**[0:30:42-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:30:42):**  talking about.  When we start talking about produce, that's going into the food system, there are, there  are rules against things, for example, with USDA work organic, and I don't want to, I  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:30:53):**  don't want to misspeak.  And so I'm sure there'll be in the comment section saying, no, it's actually this many  days.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:31:00):**  But it's, you know, it's roughly 90 days, right?  Post exposure that we can even think about growing food on this ground.  And so for some people, that's a whole crop, right?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:31:15):**  Area where, right.  And so we were, we actually had a community composting program on the farm where we would  get, you know, members of the community could buy these little five gallon buckets and bring  
**[0:31:26-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:31:26):**  their food scraps from their kitchen.  And then we would get our biggest thing was carbon.  And so we would get wood chips.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:31:37):**  So that was the base of our organic matter applications was wood chips.  So you know, we get 10 loads a day from the chipping trucks.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:31:46):**  And so so here, let me I can walk you through a field prep.  That's the best way to to understand.  And obviously, you know, timing, how many guys you got at the moment all plays, but  
**[0:32:00-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:00):**  in a perfect world, what we would do is we would go ahead and set our set our field into  rows.  And so we have a little row maker that would set the field into rows, we would then come  
**[0:32:11-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:11):**  through with a flame weeder, we would let that row sit for as long as we can stand it  going with a flame weeder and get anything that's terminated, go back through with the  compost application like a top dress.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:24):**  And so two to three inches if we can, sometimes, you know, it's we hear people talk and they're  like, well, it has to be three.  When you're in the field, you can't I mean, you're slinging compost, you know.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:37):**  And so from there, it kind of depended on the crop, what would come next.  And so if we could stand it, it sit for another two to three weeks, and we'd let anything  that was there germinate germinate.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:48):**  And then you could go back through with your flame weeder and get anything that's kind  of germinated.  Of course, you know, an organic produce plastic is your best friend.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:32:59):**  And so you can utilize bed top covers to help control weeds.  So and again, it depended on the crop.  If the crops, it's a six week romaine crop, we're not going to lay plastic for that.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:33:12):**  We're just gonna we're gonna we use high density planting much like y'all use high density  grazing.  And so we plant really, really close together really tightly.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:33:24):**  And so with that, post harvest is really for most operations like this is where it's what  becomes most important.  And so harvesting techniques can leave a lot more organic matter in your soil.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:33:40):**  So like, for example, when when you're removing a field of collards, you're cutting them at  the base and leaving the entire root system in the ground, versus pulling the entire plant  out.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:33:52):**  Which, that's what a mechanical harvester would do and take the whole route out.  Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, it depends on the operation, right?  You have huge operations that are still harvesting a lot by hand, they would just have a machine  
**[0:34:05-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:34:05):**  following the guys, but it depends on the crop.  But from there, what I would generally my, in most seasons, we would then go back in  with a cover crop.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:34:17):**  And so depending on the season, obviously would would dictate what we would do, we would  use anything from Sudan grass to to field peas, to cow peas, dike and radishes, a mix  sometimes.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:34:37):**  It really just depended on the season and what I was going to be growing there next.  For example, a sunflower cover crop is really great for a field that you're trying to lay  dormant all summer, or all spring and summer.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:34:53):**  But if you're going to grow in one of those seasons, that's not a that's not a great cover  crop to go with.  And so from there, what I would generally do is flail mow the cover crop once once I'm  
**[0:35:06-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:06):**  ready to terminate it.  And that organic matter would just sit on the top of the soil and we'd rinse and repeat.  And so yeah, that's that's the process.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:22):**  That's the field prep.  I like it.  I like it.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:27):**  Yeah.  It's like, so I don't, I kind of want to know, like, how much production you get per acre  per man.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:37):**  Sure.  Yeah.  I don't know how to phrase the question without.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:41):**  So what we generally in market gardening or small scale, like direct to consumer farming,  what we generally talk about is like dollar per linear foot.  Okay.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:35:51):**  It's just how we start talking about, you know, we're on dense, heavy clay soils.  And so generally, in your first couple of years, you might be at like $5 a linear foot,  right?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:36:08):**  As your soils begin to improve on a new operation, you know, that three to five year mark, maybe  you're hopefully looking to maybe not double it, but, you know, creep towards that $8 a  linear foot, or maybe you do double it, right?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:36:23):**  Maybe you do reach that $10.  You know, in certain industries like the direct to consumer floral industry, they're seeing  $15 to $17 a linear foot.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:36:33):**  And so it, you know, it varies.  You're so diversified in this type of operation that it definitely varies from crop to crop.  And then we generally say that it depends on your equipment.  
**[0:36:47-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:36:47):**  And so, you know, there's some market gardens that don't use a tractor, or they use like  a walk behind tractor, we were using a regular full size tractor.  And so, you know, for us, we could, you know, a team of five guys could probably work 10  
**[0:37:04-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:37:04):**  acres of produce.  Versus if you're going the other way, you know, one guy could maybe work half an acre  to an acre by himself if they're only using a walk behind tractor or something like that.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:37:16):**  Okay.  So, what would be some tips for home gardeners?  You know, I love to talk about supply chain shortage on this show.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:37:26):**  I'm not gonna jump on that soapbox today.  You know, I want to preface that question with this.  Whenever I made my TikTok, I said, I'm not going to talk about gardening.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:37:38):**  I don't like I've been in production ag my whole life.  And I don't want to be pigeonholed into like the gardening guy.  Like I don't have a growing space behind my house.  
**[0:37:50-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:37:50):**  Like I don't do stuff like that.  You know, like, that's just not what I do.  And there was a point where my growth had just halted on TikTok and other social medias.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:02):**  Like it had just halted.  And it was like, man, like other people in the ag industry, they just really don't want  to see produce.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:09):**  It's just, it doesn't have eyes and a heartbeat.  Like they're just not about it.  It doesn't have babies.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:14):**  Like they can't go pet the cute furry radish out in the field.  Exactly.  They just, yeah.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:20):**  People would get a kick when I would like eat something with dirty hands, but that would  be like where the excitement stopped.  And so that's where I came up with five gardening tips from a farmer.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:32):**  And I felt like that concept didn't, it gave me what I desired, where it didn't pigeonhole  me into being like the gardening guy.  But that and the other five tips you did, both of those were genius, dude.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:47):**  Like they were genius because you got to tag other people and their followers got to see  it.  It boosted your brand.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:38:54):**  It was like genius.  Awesome.  And so that, A, I realized that there were probably a lot more people interested in gardening  
**[0:39:04-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:04):**  than they were farming on social media.  When we just talk about the masses and the percents of populations, it was going to expose  me to a whole new group of people.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:13):**  And then like you said, with the five farm facts, I love people.  I love people.  I love being with people.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:21):**  I love talking to people.  I love learning about other operations.  I love doing all of that.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:25):**  And so there's never been a five farm fact video that was just me.  And sometimes I don't even give a fact.  I just open it up just because it's, the people have loved it because now what I found was  
**[0:39:40-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:40):**  I had a large audience of gardening people and now we're connecting them with these other  producers.  And so when we talk about bridging the gap and consumer education, we were all of a sudden  
**[0:39:54-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:39:54):**  really accomplishing that.  I felt like we were really, really accomplishing that for the most part.  You're never going to be able to eliminate all the goofiness out there, but for the most  
**[0:40:06-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:40:06):**  part, I felt like we were accomplishing that.  And I will say, I don't discriminate based on operation type on my farm fact videos.  And so conventional, organic, large scale, small scale, if you're involved in the ag  
**[0:40:22-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:40:22):**  industry and you want to give me a farm fact, as long as it's accurate and correct, we'll  put it on there.  Now there are rules though.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:40:33):**  Anyone who's collaborated with me knows this, that I'm very specific about what I ask for.  And this, and it's so funny too, because it kind of weeds people out.  And so oftentimes people will want to send something like, there's lots of things that  
**[0:40:50-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:40:50):**  people don't know about the ag industry and that'll be their fact.  And so I tell them, we don't want bird's eye view facts.  Literally I have a request that I type out and it's, if you could please provide me a  
**[0:41:03-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:41:03):**  three to five second farm fact about your operation that is not from a bird's eye view,  but it's very hands-on.  For example, and then I'll come up with something, a gradish can take up to 28 days to be harvested  
**[0:41:17-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:41:17):**  or this point in the horse's hoof is called the frog.  And so it's never.  A dung beetle will fly this far to find an appealing pat.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:41:28):**  Yeah.  I wish I knew what that number was.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:41:33):**  It's very, very specific, very, very low level on the ground facts.  There's all as I, sorry, I started getting excited prior to, prior to a year and a half  ago, I had zero social media and no social media.  
**[0:41:52-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:41:52):**  You couldn't find me anywhere.  And so as I started the journey, I realized that there were lots of great accounts out  there, but they were doing what we're talking about.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:00):**  They would come on and they would do a video about nutrition in the soil and they would  use all of these big words and they would be talking about nutrition up here, but they  never walked you through their soil prep process.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:14):**  Like I just did.  Right.  It was all of this fact and facts and education from way up here, looking at the industry  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:21):**  from an airplane.  And it was never, no, no, no, this is it.  This is how you do it.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:26):**  A radish takes a French breakfast.  Radish takes 28 days to germinate.  And you know, you, when you transplant something, this is how you should do it.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:34):**  And, and don't confuse that with how to's right.  That that's what I always say with the farm facts too, is I don't want to how to, I want  an actual ground level fact.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:45):**  And that's all that came to be.  Okay.  What's your favorite crop to grow?  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:53):**  Easy.  Okra.  Why?  
**[0:42:56-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:42:56):**  And here's why.  Okra is one of the most, it's the underdog.  It's one of the most underrated.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:06):**  And frankly, it's a vegetable that people turn their nose up to.  Right.  They think of slimy.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:11):**  I think I've heard now that there was a vegetable in the early or there's a commercial in the  early eighties that talked about how slimy Okra was.  Right.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:18):**  Which I hate stuff like that does awful things for industry.  For example, cereal, right.  Cereal being the most important thing to eat in the morning.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:29):**  Like it does, it does awful things for industry.  Even when it's proved false in a lawsuit, people don't get that marketing out of their  mind from 20 years ago.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:38):**  So but so Okra, so first off, right, we got like 85 different varieties of Okra that we  can grow.  And so if you're, if you're, if you say you don't like Okra, well, hang on just a second.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:50):**  Let's try a new variety.  There's also much like almost every other vegetable, there's a million ways to cook  it.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:43:58):**  Right.  And so and I would highly encourage everyone to stay away from boiling it.  You can do something other than fry it.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:05):**  Yes.  So my top two ways are A, to blacken it.  And so get your cast iron nice and hot.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:12):**  Use some good living olive oil.  And then take that, take that Okra and just sear it as hot as you can in that cast iron.  All the way around a little bit of fresh sea salt and soy sauce.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:25):**  Good to go.  Ok.  Whole.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:28):**  Don't do nothing to it.  The best way is Okra corn Okra pancakes.  So picture fried.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:33):**  That's what I've been eating.  Yeah, but in a patty, right?  So it's basically the lazy way to make fried Okra.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:41):**  So take your take your region Mills cornmeal.  Mix it up into a make hot water cornbread though if you're from the south, you're familiar  with that concept.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:44:51):**  You don't want to make regular cornbread you want to make hot water corn cornbread mix.  Take your Okra slice it up in there and then pour it like a pancake.  You don't have to dip each Okra out individually.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:02):**  Taste better in a cast iron because you taste the last good.  And those are my those are my two favorite ways.  Now it goes.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:10):**  It's not just eating right.  It also goes to a management tactic.  I'll be honest.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:15):**  Okra sucks to harvest.  You have to harvest it at least every other day or it gets too big.  Yeah, it's got little spines on it.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:23):**  So it gets real itchy.  You know, we've we've learned to either ignore it or wear protective gear when you harvest  it.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:30):**  We have backpacks that we wear so we can use both hands to harvest.  But post crop is where I see Okra being the most valuable because it is essentially a  cover crop.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:43):**  This is a plant that grows 15 feet tall.  It grows three feet wide.  So when you're growing on a on a 30 inch bed, it's perfect.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:45:52):**  It covers the entire bed and the aisle in shade.  So you get very little weed growth once the plants are established, which is right.  That's like our number one or number two reason that we would use a cover crop is to reduce  
**[0:46:03-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:03):**  our seed bed, our weed population, plant matter.  When we start talking about organic matter into the soil, we need mass volume.  And so a plant that is brittle, that's 15 feet tall and three feet wide can easily be  
**[0:46:18-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:18):**  flail mode, leaving it's almost like using sunflowers as a cover crop.  Right.  It uses it leaves a three inch layer of organic matter over your soil top.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:30):**  And then it has an extremely aggressive root system.  So it'll grow in our dense clay soil, which we love anything that'll grow in it.  But the roots are extremely aggressive.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:39):**  It holds that 12 foot tall plant in the ground during hurricanes.  That's an aggressive root system.  We leave it in.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:45):**  We leave it in the ground.  And so literally that whole plant, once we get our first frost, it'll die, run the flail  mower over it and we'll leave it there till next spring.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:46:57):**  You just said something about first frost and you made a comment earlier about doesn't  freeze.  I wanted to circle back and ask you about last February because I know we all had that.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:07):**  I wanted to know about that too, actually, since you're a produce guy.  For anyone listening, the difference between a freeze and a frost, right?  Usually a freeze is when we drop below 32 degrees for an extended period of time.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:20):**  A frost is just when we get a very, very light layer of ice.  And we usually don't freeze during the year.  We can sometimes get up to one frost throughout the year.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:32):**  And that's usually somewhere between one.  Say again?  Up to one.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:37):**  Up to one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:40):**  Exactly.  Now, last February.  So I, not to sound like the tinfoil guy, right?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:48):**  Like, but, but I was the guy February 12th, February 10th of 2021 saying like, y'all don't  get it.  This is going to be bad.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:47:59):**  Like farmer's almond says, it's going to be awful.  The news says, it's going to be awful.  Like if anyone is taking this lightly, then you're wrong.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:10):**  You are wrong.  You're going to wake up the day after Valentine's day and the landscape is going to change.  We have, we're south of Houston.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:18):**  There's tropical plants everywhere.  Oh, absolutely.  The landscape, like people couldn't grasp that concept.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:24):**  And they looked at me like I was crazy.  So the landscape is going to change.  We're going to have trees that have been in the ground for 35 years.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:31):**  Cause that was the last time this really happened here.  And they're going to be gone.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:37):**  And then sure enough.  So I stayed at the farm most of the time.  I obviously made sure my family was safe and all that.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:46):**  And so that first night it was interesting.  It's, you know, it started to snow pretty early on.  Like right when the sun went down, it started to snow, which then created a layer of ice  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:48:57):**  on our hoop house.  Now we don't have greenhouses here.  We have hoop houses.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:00):**  And so plastic houses generally used for propagation with no alternative temperature control.  So no heating source, no cooling source.  And so we decided to do what, you know, we couldn't find a propane heater anywhere.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:15):**  And so we decided to do to start off was we were going to bring in three feet of compost  and cover our entire floor in it.  And that works really well for like the first six hours.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:26):**  For the first six hours, I was sitting in there basically sweating, watching it snow  through the plastic.  The snow was building up on the plastic.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:34):**  Yeah, and so I'm just kind of watching it.  I'm like, okay, we're going to be okay.  And then I started watching, you know, it started to kind of cool off in the greenhouse,  
**[0:49:43-0:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:43):**  which I expected, but I had gotten these electronic thermometers that would send like my messages  to my phone and I started watching them and, you know, it hit 50 degrees and then it hit  40 degrees and then it pushed 38.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:49:58):**  Now mind you, we seed our tomatoes January 1st.  And this was on the first night, right?  This is on the first night.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:06):**  We seed our tomatoes.  And so I had tomatoes that were ready to go in the ground.  We generally plant February 14th.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:14):**  Like we generally will transplant our tomatoes the second or third week in February.  And so I had tomatoes that were ready to go out.  The only reason that I didn't plant them like an early planting was because the farmer's  
**[0:50:26-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:26):**  home and act said, Hey, it's probably going to snow in Texas and Oklahoma, just so y'all  know.  And so I was like, guys, like we use this document as a guiding tool.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:35):**  Dates might be a little off.  Let's just hold off to like the third or fourth week in February.  And so temperature got like to 35 in the hoop house that night.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:46):**  And I'm just watching it like, okay, tomorrow is supposed to be colder.  I got to figure something out.  So sun comes up and everything was covered in a light layer of snow.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:50:56):**  We didn't get it heavy.  The snow, the snowfall did not come heavy, but everything was white.  So I kind of walked outside that morning and thought, okay, I got to figure something out  
**[0:51:05-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:51:05):**  at this point.  Once the sun came up, it went from 38 degrees in the hoop house to 112 degrees immediately.  As soon as the sun hit that plastic house, that compost started getting hot.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:51:18):**  I had to, I had to reopen everything in the greenhouse and let it air out and then close  it at lunchtime.  It would immediately raise, open it up again.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:51:29):**  I kept having to do that all day to kind of let it vent.  Again our systems, they're just not made for this.  So that second night I decided I would go ahead and start a fire.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:51:43):**  And in fact, we didn't, we don't use smut pots anymore.  And so I had to make, I had to make some.  I made a bunch of little ones.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:51:54):**  I, you know, the hanging metal chicken feeders.  Yes.  I took those, I cleaned and emptied them out.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:02):**  Chickens weren't eaten anyways, so cold.  They still had food.  That's a joke.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:07):**  But, and I lined our greenhouse in those and I started a huge fire outside and all night  I would keep those full of coals.  It got very smoky, but it stayed warm.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:21):**  Right?  And that night I was able to maintain it about 35, 36 degrees.  And so it got about 16 degrees that night and I was able to keep that like 20, 20 degree  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:38):**  temperature increase in there.  And that was burning all night.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:44):**  And so the third night it was, the third night I went in,  ignorantly, especially as a young grower who had never experienced this before I went into  it.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:52:57):**  I had kind of looked at the forecast and it kind of said, okay, we're not supposed to  drop below freezing.  We are supposed to drop below.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:02):**  We're not supposed to drop below.  Went right at sundown, closed everything up real tight, got everything burning real good  and left.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:11):**  And I told myself we hadn't lost power.  We had never lost power.  So I told myself, my phone goes off when I come back.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:20):**  Went home.  We go to sleep, we lose power, which means the thermometers can't send signals.  And you didn't have anything that told you that it lost power there.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:33):**  Right.  Because in your sleeping you think no news is good news when you're sleeping.  So I woke up and realized, I look at it and it tells me what I thought was the temperature,  
**[0:53:44-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:44):**  you know, 38 degrees.  Oh, we're good.  And I realized it said the last update that when it was 38 degrees was like 9 p.m.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:52):**  So I panic.  I drive out to the farm as quick as I can.  When you get close to the thermometer, it'll manually upload the night's temperatures.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:53:59):**  I realized that it dropped to about 27 degrees in there.  Now this also teaches you some things about plant resiliency and how much frost can play  a part in busting plant cells.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:54:15):**  Right.  So, you know, we learned a lot about ambient temperatures.  And so all around the outside, along the plastic of the greenhouse, we lost almost everything.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:54:25):**  But as you creeped closer into the greenhouse, you saw that, you know, if it was 27 degrees  for 10 hours in there, it was 27 degrees everywhere, but it wasn't 27 degrees on the leaf surface,  right?  
**[0:54:38-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:54:38):**  Ambient temperature around the leaf was not 27 degrees.  And you realize frost plays a huge role in that and then 24 hours of below freezing plays  a huge role in that.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:54:47):**  So it wasn't a total loss.  We lost.  I hope farms, we lost about 85 percent on the field and about 30 to 40 percent in the  
**[0:54:58-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:54:58):**  hoop house.  The unfortunate thing was is of that 30 to 40 percent in the hoop house, a large majority  of it was our tomatoes because it was so cold.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:09):**  We didn't lose all of them, but we lost a lot of them.  And so we immediately went to replanting.  Right.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:16):**  But, you know, a panicking vegetable farm that just lost everything is the only thing  you can do.  We have forced them in our pre freeze preparation.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:25):**  We harvested everything we could.  We harvested everything we could.  And then we used every bit of remade frost cloth, as most people know it, to cover everything  
**[0:55:33-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:33):**  we could.  Knowing that it was just kind of up in the air at this point.  And so we went back in with all of our baby greens because those only take four weeks.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:44):**  All of our radishes, because those only take four weeks.  Anything that would be really quick.  We went back in with immediately and then slowly but surely started to replant everything  
**[0:55:54-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:55:54):**  else.  Lost 100 percent of citrus.  I was going to say citrus sounded like they took the biggest hit.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:00):**  Yeah.  You know that most of the citrus here is grafted onto trifoliate rootstock.  So a lot of that rootstock.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:05):**  In fact, if you drive around, you see, you know, the rootstock, it grows so quick.  It's six foot tall now.  But it's trifoliate coming back everywhere.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:14):**  Most people lost 100 percent of their citrus.  Wow.  I knew they grew citrus down there, but I didn't know that most of the most of South  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:24):**  Texas citrus was grafted onto another tree.  Yeah.  So almost all of it is.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:32):**  Yeah.  So I know the Meyer lemon does pretty well on its own rootstock here, but most of your  other is either going to be grafted onto trifoliate or sour orange.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:43):**  Interesting.  We could.  That's a that's a I could go on.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:48):**  That's a whole nother podcast topic.  I could go on for hours.  I want to know what your least favorite thing to grow is.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:56:56):**  Swiss chard.  I despise it.  I don't have to think about it.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:01):**  So I have this rule.  And if you're on my tick tock, you know, I appreciate raw vegetables.  Yeah.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:07):**  Well, my favorite things to do and it's how I harvest things.  You can tell a lot about a crop based just picking up, picking it up and eating it.  If it tastes good, raw.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:19):**  Imagine how good it's going to taste capable hands cooked.  Right.  And I don't care.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:24):**  I don't care what stage Swiss chard is in, whether it might be micro green or looks like  a palm leaf.  It's gross.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:31):**  Now I'll give it to it.  That's a hardy plant.  It all froze in the in the freeze and immediately came back and it'll kind of die back in the  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:43):**  summer and put on these real small leaves.  And as soon as it cools off, man, it blows up.  You can keep it in your after.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:49):**  Oh, I have some huge.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like elephant ears.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:57:55):**  By the way, if you haven't had creams with chard, maybe that'll help.  I had it almost every which way.  And it's not bad cook.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:05):**  But my whole deal is, is that raw?  It's awful.  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:09):**  So you can't awful almost everything else.  I can find an appreciation and its flavor texture raw.  Not Swiss chard.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:19):**  Not Swiss chard.  Sorry, Swiss chard.  I like it in Asian cuisine, usually that's soaked in something hot and something soy  
**[0:58:32-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:32):**  sauce.  Yeah, that's fair.  Now at this point in the podcast, there are going to be people wondering, OK, I haven't  
**[0:58:40-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:40):**  heard this guy talk about meat yet.  What's the deal?  And one of the most common questions I get on my social media is, am I a vegan?  
**[0:58:49-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:49):**  No, I am not a vegan.  I believe in a very well-rounded plate with equal portions of everything you're eating.  And I enjoy eating around a plate, right?  
**[0:58:59-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:58:59):**  Whether it be a medium rare steak or some pasture raised poultry or even pork.  I love some.  Just before we got on the record this today, I was just doing a little bit of background  
**[0:59:14-0:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:14):**  on you.  And isn't there a steakhouse located at your farm stand?  Well, so my family's farm is...  
**[0:59:25-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:25):**  Hoburg's farm stand.  You can probably imagine why that came up in a Google search.  Of course.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:31):**  Yes.  And so, yeah, so Ray Greek is his name.  He came to my family in the 90s, real good friends with my grandfather, and he started  
**[0:59:38-0:59:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:38):**  doing meat processing.  And so that just evolved.  And now he's got a full section of the store, does all of his own meat processing, including  
**[0:59:46-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:46):**  game, and all sorts of stuff.  You name it.  Greek smokehouse.  
**[0:59:53-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=0:59:53):**  I can imagine that's not a popular place to eat at all.  Yeah.  There are people who come just for that, right?  
**[1:00:04-1:00:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:00:04):**  How many months do you have to get reservations months in advance to get into a place like  that?  Because I can imagine a steakhouse smokehouse that's co-located with a slaughterhouse and  
**[1:00:13-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:00:13):**  a farm stand, you know, everything's going to be fresh.  Everything's going to be good and fresh, which, you know, not to get deeper philosophical,  but those are the elements that have played into my life.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:00:28):**  That's how we came up with taste of simple life for good living.  It's like fresh is always been something that's played an impact on my life, my entire life.  I always like to say I was never really introduced into like, like properly prepared or fancy  
**[1:00:49-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:00:49):**  cooked cuisine growing up.  Right.  We just ate what grandma cooked and it was always fresh.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:00:55):**  There was never anything like out of the ordinary.  It was fresh, but it wasn't out of the ordinary.  Right.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:02):**  It's not like.  And it was kind of probably seasonal too.  Oh, it's extremely.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:06):**  I mean, no avocado toast in February, no strawberries in December.  No, no.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:13):**  No.  Well, it depends on the year.  So, so strawberries in Texas is really interesting because we plant in October and if it's a  
**[1:01:19-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:19):**  warm winter, then you can pick some early berries in November and December.  Usually though they will overwinter.  And as soon as it warms up February timeframe, I mean, they just turn on and you're picking  
**[1:01:31-1:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:31):**  berries.  But so, yeah, you know, I always like to say the fanciest thing that ever ate was a strawberry  biscuit.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:39):**  So my grandma at the end of strawberry season would make these homemade buttermilk biscuits  and we'd go and pick the last bit of strawberries and cut them up and eat them with the biscuit.  And that was probably the fanciest thing we ever ate.  
**[1:01:48-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:01:48):**  Right.  But now I have this three years of experience growing and selling to chefs.  My cuisine mindset is kind of broadened and I find myself at home cooking ways that I  
**[1:02:01-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:01):**  never, I never ate growing.  I'm experimenting and, Oh, I saw that in so-and-so's kitchen.  I really wanted to try making that cucumber gazpacho for example.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:13):**  I didn't know what gazpacho was about two years ago.  And now here I am like in the spring, I'm like, I can't wait for cucumber gazpacho.  What is gazpacho?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:22):**  It's like cold soup basically.  Traditionally made with, it's like traditionally made with tomatoes.  So a picture like a cold tomato soup, but walking into a restaurant, they were, they  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:34):**  used cucumbers and it's, I mean, it's one of the most incredible things you've ever  eaten.  Especially in the heat of the summer.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:41):**  Like it's just so refreshing.  There's gotta be more to it than just cold soup because cold soup's never, never that  good.  
**[1:02:51-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:02:51):**  I think that's why we invented microwave.  It's pretty good.  So what, I want to talk about your army time.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:00):**  When was that?  In 2010, 2014.  2010 to 2014.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:07):**  So yeah, I would have gotten out in 2006.  What was your MOS?  I was a 91 Foxtrot.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:16):**  So small arms and artillery repairman.  Interesting.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:20):**  What was your MOS?  I didn't, I didn't even, I guess I did know, I guess I did know that you were in.  I was a Navy guy.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:26):**  I spent a little over eight years in the Navy and I was primarily main machinery.  I spent four years as a machinist mate.  Then I cross rated to gas turbine technician mechanic and did that for about four years.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:41):**  So I did two boats in a shore command.  And after I did shore duty, I was kind of like, I don't like this part of the Navy.  Send me back to sea.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:49):**  And they said, no, I said, okay, I'm leaving.  I'm out of here.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:55-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:55):**  Yeah.  Sure.  It's for the birds.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:03:58):**  I like boats.  Sure.  I've told this story on a, on a podcast before, but my situation was kind of similar.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:06):**  I was stationed in Washington state, which I liked for six months out of the year, the  other six months awful.  But I, I didn't, I didn't dislike my job.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:19):**  It was just a job to me.  Right.  And so halfway through my army career, I find out that 68 Tango is a job.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:27):**  And what that is is the, the, the animal veterinarian assistant.  Right.  I felt like that kind of played to my strengths, just growing up in a farming environment.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:36):**  Did you get mad at your recruiter?  Like why in the hell did he tell me about this?  That was the thing.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:41):**  And so how the story goes, went to the retention office and they said, Oh, we got you.  And they said, you know, we got you a school date.  You just got to sign right now.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:52):**  And I was like, I need a night.  And they're like, well, after 12 hours, the reservation expires.  So it's up to you.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:04:59):**  Okay.  I came back the next day and you know, they're like, you can go to school in three years.  You're gonna have to re-enlist to stay here for the next three years for you to go to  
**[1:05:07-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:07):**  school.  And I said, ah, I'm going back to Texas.  That's probably fair.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:15):**  Yep.  The Navy never really did anything like that, but like opportunities to cross train from  one job to another.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:29):**  They weren't very common.  I was one of the few people that, that went from one, one rate to another, but it was  just like going from one kind of mechanic to another kind of mechanic and only about  
**[1:05:40-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:40):**  20% of what I had to know changed.  So it wasn't that bad.  So, I noticed a couple other things.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:49):**  Have you done, and we talked about composting, have you done any worms, vermicasting, any  of that stuff?  No, I haven't gotten much into vermiculture only because you, I mean, well, you know,  
**[1:05:59-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:05:59):**  you're, y'all are built in hot places.  You know, we, you, you've got to, that's a whole part of the operation if you do it here.  You know, it's not a, for us, it wouldn't be as simple as, oh, I'm going to get this  
**[1:06:11-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:11):**  little bin and put it in my garage or in my living room or whatever.  Like we'd have to build a cooled structure, at least a covered structure or something  buried or something like that.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:21):**  You know, what, what I, what I like to, do I understand the benefit?  Yeah.  Have we gotten into it?  
**[1:06:26-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:26):**  No, we haven't.  Okay.  It's probably not easy to do at the scale that you need it done.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:32):**  And that, and that's the thing is, could we do a small demonstration?  Sure.  You know, and if we ever got into like at our own operation to having kids out for formal  
**[1:06:41-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:41):**  education or something like that, would we do that?  Probably.  But, you know, I remember the biggest little farm, that documentary had a huge operation.  
**[1:06:53-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:06:53):**  It was a huge two story open air building that, I mean, they did it right.  You could pick that documentary apart on a bunch of stuff, but what they did wrong on  the worm farming is not one of those things you could pick apart.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:08):**  It was state of the art first class.  It was awesome.  Okay.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:14):**  So, other, other than the February disaster that was kind of collectively shared from  pretty much even farther south of you to all the way up into Canada.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:29):**  What, what's been one of your biggest wrecks that you want to talk about?  What does it tell you?  Well, so first off, I actually, I got this question.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:36):**  I got a question about two years ago and I always, anytime anyone talks about the freeze,  I always go back to this.  And so it was, it was, this was pre COVID.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:45):**  It was pre free is pre all this crazy stuff.  Right.  And I was sitting on a panel and it was at the Houston food bank actually.  
**[1:07:54-1:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:07:54):**  And they had just brought in some producers.  And one of the questions they posed was, why aren't there more farmers?  Why aren't there more people wanting to farm in this area specifically?  
**[1:08:04-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:04):**  And I said, look, every year it's something, whether it be a historical flood or a hurricane,  right?  This past February now.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:14):**  Right.  And so like this easy, this, this place anywhere really is not easy to produce an agricultural  product.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:23):**  Right.  And this place is not excluded from that between hurricanes and and hurricanes.  You're enough.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:34):**  I wouldn't want to have to deal with that.  You know, I'm going to drought and fire.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:39):**  I'm going to change it up a bit.  And so, and only because this is really fresh for me and I don't mean to get like emotional  or anything like that, but you know, at the farm we have the farm I used to be at, we  
**[1:08:51-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:08:51):**  had the training program and last January I met it.  I met a man by the name of Lawrence and we, he went to the training program and we got  him trained up and he was really good.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:06):**  And so we kept him on the farm and me and Lawrence worked together for nine months on  the farm.  And I made a video about this yesterday on my Tik TOK, but I kind of said in the video,  
**[1:09:15-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:15):**  if you've ever worked shoulder to shoulder with someone in an agricultural industry,  especially, especially out in the field, it's a different type of bond.  It's, it's really, it's closer to a bond of serving with someone in the military.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:28):**  I can agree with that.  I think, yeah.  Just, you know, when it's 105 degrees outside 99% humidity, and you're going through that  
**[1:09:36-1:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:36):**  with someone else, it's just a different kind of bond that you, and you're, you're problem  solving with people out on the farm, right?  And you're, you're celebrating, you're celebrating successes and you're accepting defeats.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:49):**  You're doing all of these things.  It's it's this bond that you form with someone that's hard to describe to someone else.  Absolutely.  
**[1:09:57-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:09:57):**  Before I left the farm I found out Lawrence came and said, look, you know, my, my in-laws  had been exposed and I, I, you know, I need to go get tested.  And then all of a sudden he was in the hospital and we found out yesterday that he passed  
**[1:10:15-1:10:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:10:15):**  away this weekend.  And I have to say, as far as like struggles go, and I know that's not necessarily operationally  centric, but that's one of the hardest things that I feel like I've had to deal with in  
**[1:10:29-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:10:29):**  a long time.  You know, there's the last couple of years has been crazy and we never know what to expect.  But here you have someone who is just same age as me, just as healthy as I am.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:10:44):**  Three kids, a wife, sole supporter of his family, wasn't growing food for the money.  So that's tough.  That's tough.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:10:56):**  That is tough.  I was going to ask about, I was going to actually ask about Lawrence and I'm kind of glad you  brought it up.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:05):**  So yeah.  And I said this a lot.  I had this big dramatic live yesterday because, you know, I don't do that a lot.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:13):**  I don't put a lot of like, I don't want to say my feelings, but I just don't go into  that side of myself on the internet.  I never really have, but that one struck me.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:23):**  And I felt people, people on my TikTok and all my other various forms of social media,  they got to know people on the operation.  So it was almost picture it being like characters in a reality TV show.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:34):**  Right.  People lost too.  Yeah, they do.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:38):**  And so I felt, I felt the need to make that video yesterday.  And then I went on my live and on my live.  I was kind of scrolling through and you, you don't, you know, everyone kind of laughs about  
**[1:11:50-1:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:11:50):**  the whole social media thing, but you don't realize how much life you're actually capturing  by doing what we do on social media.  And it's often thrown around, Oh, y'all are just doing silly dances.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:03):**  And you're, you're, you're just advertising a product that someone sent you or whatever,  but I don't do the silly dances.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:10):**  Well, yeah, I know.  I know.  But deep down, what you're actually doing is you're, you're documenting, you're documenting  
**[1:12:19-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:19):**  something that you have no idea how powerful it could be just like that.  Absolutely.  And in this specific situation, you know, I been messaging his wife and I sent his wife  
**[1:12:33-1:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:33):**  all this stuff.  And I mean, basically she was speechless.  It was like, here, here's the last nine months of your husband.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:42):**  Yeah.  And I do a intro interview with anyone who ever started at the farm.  I would do an intro video, which I would, whether you're training people or not, even  
**[1:12:50-1:13:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:12:50):**  if you're just hiring people, do that for your people on their very first day, sit them  down and just record them, telling them about yourselves, like, Hey, who are you?  And just capture that.  
**[1:13:03-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:03):**  Right.  And so in this specific situation, it was extremely powerful, but it's a powerful tool  to, to look at a year from now, right?  
**[1:13:12-1:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:12):**  When that person is with you a year from now, you can play that for him.  And you think, Whoa, like, Hey, what are your goals?  Right?  
**[1:13:19-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:19):**  Tell us where you're at in your life right now.  It's powerful.  I have, there's another picture right after the freeze about six weeks after the freeze.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:29):**  And we had harvested our first round of French breakfast, radishes, Lawrence, all he did  was grant.  He had this laugh and he would grant.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:36):**  He wouldn't talk much.  And it's this picture of Lawrence and he's holding these two big old beautiful bunches  of French breakfast, radishes.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:43):**  And he's just got this grin on his face.  And I know that it was because we had just went through two months of brutal torture,  basically seeing our fields just Brown.  
**[1:13:54-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:13:54):**  Right.  And the picture tells that story.  And it's like, again, in the moment, all I did was snap a picture.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:01):**  And now looking back, like I was documenting, I was documenting that journey.  Yeah, that's important to point out.  You know, I spend a lot of time working by myself and sometimes it's a real challenge  
**[1:14:16-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:16):**  for me to, you know, to do social media.  You know, I, I kind of almost feel like I've let, let a lot of my Facebook and Instagram  fans down just cause I'm not very active on those platforms anymore, but, and I'm not  
**[1:14:29-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:29):**  really that active on Tik TOK either, but it's just sometimes social media is just so  hard.  And sometimes a lot of the negativity is, is really is difficult.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:39):**  I'm thinking about one of my videos lately that was kind of popular and at a stock tank,  had a little problem with it and yeah, there's some algae in it.  Okay, great.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:53):**  Everybody in the comments is like, Oh, clean your tanks out.  I'd never let them get that dirty.  Okay.  
**[1:14:57-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:14:57):**  Clear water too.  Right.  I don't think I know what you're talking about.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:00):**  Yeah.  I mean, the water looks, the water looks good.  Great.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:03):**  I have 29 tanks.  Those things are 16 foot in diameter.  I mean, it's like, it's a full day project to get one drained out.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:12):**  Then you got to wait for it to dry enough to where you can shovel it out, which is a  half a day project.  And then you got to fill it back up with water.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:19):**  So it's like, it's a two day project just to do one of them.  I have 29 of those things on my ranch.  Do I want to spend two months every year cleaning tanks?  
**[1:15:28-1:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:28):**  No, I promise you I have better shit to do.  So they feed algae to cattle now.  Right.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:35):**  I mean, they're like, Oh, we'll get goldfish, get goldfish, put goldfish in them.  Where are the goldfish?  Like I will happily go put goldfish in them.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:47):**  If you can find me a source.  I'm so far out in the weeds.  Like where am I going to get goldfish from?  
**[1:15:53-1:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:15:53):**  Yeah.  Well, I've heard of that too, but there's no way when it gets 110 out there, I'm not  dumb for thinking that there's no way those goldfish are making it through that.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:04):**  Right.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there's one tank with goldfish in it.  
**[1:16:09-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:09):**  I do have one tank with goldfish in it.  And I, I kind of must hesitate to say it because I do have them and I could promise you this.  They are impossible to catch even out of a 16 foot stock tank.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:23):**  That's a foot and a half deep.  Like they are fast, but they, the one tank that they're in.  Like I've got to figure out how to get them out of there.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:31):**  Maybe I got to build a fish trap or something and just throw the trap in there overnight  and drain the tank.  So they all go in there, but they have cleaned this thing out.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:40):**  I mean, that's yeah.  I mean, they do do a good job.  They've got her cleaned out and mid summer.  
**[1:16:46-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:16:46):**  Um, I had an intern, um, I was a little bit busy one day and his, I think his niece or  I think his niece was out and he wanted to show her around the ranch, take her fish.  And I was like, all right, you know, day off and take her fishing, but you got to go get  
**[1:17:03-1:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:17:03):**  goldfish out of that tank and move them, move at least some goldfish to another tank.  They went out there and they spent two hours to move five goldfish to another tank.  So when I go do it, I'm going to have a plan.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:17:21):**  Would a cash network, giant net, it probably would.  I just need to take the panels out that are, that are in the tank.  Cause it's got some panels in there to keep cattle out.  
**[1:17:34-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:17:34):**  Yeah.  So it's always something there.  The negativity sometimes gets to me and sometimes I'm, you know, sometimes I'm pretty careful  
**[1:17:45-1:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:17:45):**  about what I want to post or I'll, you know, I'll make content, you know, record content  all through a day and then, you know, it comes time that evening or afternoon where I sit  down and I can, you know, make a video or make a Facebook post and I'm like, uh, I watch  
**[1:17:58-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:17:58):**  it and I'm like, Oh, hell no.  Some animal rights activists.  It's just going to go nuts and have my lunch for that.  
**[1:18:04-1:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:04):**  Goodbye.  So you can't even show a picture of somebody holding a hot shot anymore.  Like even five feet away from cows.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:11):**  If they're just staying there holding a hot shot, you'll have animal rights activists  on you.  That's terrible.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:18):**  I will say, because people ask me all the time, like, do you, do you get, cause I post  a little bit of chicken content too.  And like if we, I have an uncle who's a rancher and I'll never post cattle content, but I  
**[1:18:31-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:31):**  will go live.  But people have asked me before, like, do you, do you ever catch hate?  And on one hand I've been lucky.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:42):**  The answer, the short answer is no, not really.  Like I've, I've caught very, very little disagree, disagreeing mindsets or hate or anything like  that.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:18:53):**  On the other hand, I, I made a conscious choice early on that I was going to produce content  that would shy away from even being viewed as controversial.  That if there were people who wanted to have a conversation such as you and I have had  
**[1:19:13-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:19:13):**  today, or y'all and I have had today that I would happily do that.  But as far as content that I was going to post on my page, I just made a conscious decision  that I didn't want to do that.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:19:26):**  And I look up to the people who do because sometimes I feel like, like some people might  think that I'm not willing to go to bat for my beliefs or what I think is right and all  that.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:19:39):**  And that's just not the case.  Right.  I personally don't expect me to go to bat for what you believe.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:19:45):**  Yeah.  I, a lot of times for me, it just feels like if someone took the time to leave a negative  comment on my video, then I, I really don't even have the time for it.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:19:58):**  Like I really don't even value what they're saying.  What I do really value is the kindness that I've from being on social media just yesterday  or the day before it was the day before yesterday, Friday night, Friday night, I think I had  
**[1:20:13-1:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:20:13):**  received a message on my Instagram and it was a picture.  And it was a, it was a young man and he had said, Hey, I've been going back and forth  on sending this message.  
**[1:20:24-1:20:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:20:24):**  Cause I didn't want to come off as like a creeper weird, but I'm a cattle rancher and  I, I tend to not have time for my, for my kids and my wife.  And so I wanted to figure out something that I could do that would really like show my  
**[1:20:39-1:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:20:39):**  family that I really do care.  And then I'm here and that I can be active, like not just sitting down and watching a  movie, but be active and doing something with them.  
**[1:20:49-1:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:20:49):**  And so he said he was scrolling through Tik TOK and he started watching my videos and  they put a garden in behind their house on the ranch.  And that every evening him and his wife and their kids, they go out, he sent me this,  
**[1:21:00-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:00):**  this huge, long message with pictures of his family, harvesting all of this produce.  And it was just like, you know, if that's the type of messages I can get without generating  hate or responding to some of the hateful comments that even though there are few, they,  
**[1:21:18-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:18):**  they come across my page and that's what I want to do.  You know, beautiful impact.  Yes.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:25):**  Yeah.  You've done a really good job of crafting your brand.  I it's funny you say that we, and hopefully none of my, like, hopefully none of like my  
**[1:21:37-1:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:37):**  real family family, family centric content listeners are listening right now, but I've  gone to a few meetups, Tik TOK, ag meetups, right.  And we go and they're like, yeah, you went to one right up the road from me and I didn't  
**[1:21:53-1:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:53):**  even know what was happening.  Oh no, for real?  I didn't even know that was going on.  
**[1:21:57-1:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:21:57):**  Oh man.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  
**[1:22:00-1:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:00):**  It's fine.  So we go and they're like, okay, we're going to go out tonight.  Hey, someone sends someone to go ask Farmer Froberg what he wants to do.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:13):**  And I was like, what?  So they come, they're like, hey, we're going to go out tonight.  Is that okay?  
**[1:22:19-1:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:19):**  What do you mean?  Is that okay?  They're like, well, and we didn't know like what you, and so that's, that's what  
**[1:22:25-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:25):**  I realized.  Like I truly realized that the image that I've created, I'm not saying that's not me,  but I'm not saying it's not not me.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:33):**  What I am saying is that what I wanted to give people is wholesome agricultural education  by someone with a Mr. Rogers-esque feeling.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:46-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:46):**  I think you're doing a hell of a good job.  To where we have a Tik TOK ag meetup and they wonder if they should ask me if I wanted to  go out with them or not.  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:22:56):**  Is it okay to go to the bar with him?  Is he going to be weirded out?  That's kind of what it was, right?  
**[1:23:02-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:02):**  Yeah.  Like, is he going to drink?  What is he, what is he going to do?  
**[1:23:06-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:06):**  Will he tuck his shirt in?  Like what's the deal?  Yeah, how funny.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:10):**  Little nuances.  Yeah.  Well, it looked like you guys had a heck of a time though.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:17):**  We did.  Now, now I will say like, I'm not a huge drinker.  And so in fact, me and Noah were the Noah Shiloh Farm.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:25):**  Him and I were the DDs.  But we still had a great time.  We definitely went out and we had an awesome time laughing and getting to know other people.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:36):**  You know, it's always interesting to meet other people who do this and to learn their  motivations to kind of learn what makes them tick.  To learn their theory on the subject we just talked about, you know?  
**[1:23:48-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:48):**  Right.  And it's always good.  It is, it is a heck of a lot of fun to meet other people in agriculture, not just me in  
**[1:23:59-1:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:23:59):**  ranching.  Educating them.  Yeah.  
**[1:24:02-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:24:02):**  I like meeting the sheep guys, the goat guys, you know, talking to the vegetable farmers,  the people that, you know, like the dairy farmers.  I love it.  
**[1:24:10-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:24:10):**  I love it.  And it's even better when you can, when we find and make these connections with, with  people that have a similar voice on social media.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:24:21):**  Like, you know, for, for as evil as the algorithms are on all these platforms, they've done a  pretty good job of bringing a lot of us together and helping us spread our message to the masses.  And I think that's definitely noteworthy.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:24:39):**  Now one of the funniest things though, I got to say is if we, if we, if we, if you ever  participate in a social media gathering of other agriculturalists, do it at someone's  operation and make sure you have a diverse group of producers there.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:24:56):**  What you're going to see is the vegetable guys try to chase cows.  You're going to see a corn farmer, try to lay plastic for produce.  You're going to, you're going to get to see people who very much are professional agriculturalists  
**[1:25:10-1:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:10):**  be taken way out of their comfort zone, way out of their comfort zone.  And it's so cool.  I think because as a high school teacher, that's what I love doing is how can we take  
**[1:25:23-1:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:23):**  a high school kid and put them in an agricultural situation that makes them a little uncomfortable.  It challenges them a little bit, right.  And meeting as someone else's operation with a diverse group of producers kind of does  
**[1:25:36-1:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:36):**  the same thing.  I'm glad you mentioned something about school because that reminds me to circle back to  the Hope Farms school farm you were talking about earlier.  
**[1:25:49-1:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:49):**  Yeah, yes.  All right.  So let's hear about that.  
**[1:25:53-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:53):**  Let's hear about what, what.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:25:59):**  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Now we're talking about Alvin ISD when I was the ag farm manager for Alvin ISD.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:26:04):**  Yes.  And so essentially it's not feeding the school.  That is not that is not what was going on.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:26:10):**  Right.  What this is, this specific resource was for the ag department.  So the agriculture education department in CTE to be used as a teaching resource.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:26:23):**  And so a long time ago, an old rancher died and left his ranch to Alvin ISD with the understanding  that it would always be for something having to do with agriculture education.  And so the farm bales its own hay for all the show cattle that the students raise.  
**[1:26:42-1:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:26:42):**  It raises some open show calves that they'll sell to the you know, we're not talking about  champion show livestock here, but anyone who wants to show just regular open cattle, as  well as a few show goats.  
**[1:26:55-1:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:26:55):**  And time to time they've had pigs and vegetables and you know, anything that can be used as  a teaching resource and create financial sustainability for the ag department.  You know, oftentimes and it's not as much in our area, we hear it a lot in areas that  
**[1:27:12-1:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:27:12):**  aren't agricultural centric that don't necessarily understand the importance of CTE or vocational  education or agriculture education.  We don't see a ton of resources put into that.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:27:23):**  So when you have a resource for a debt free resource for the department that is generating  income, such as selling round bales and things like that, it's a lot easier to try to get  additional resources for a department.  
**[1:27:39-1:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:27:39):**  Okay.  Maybe I was thinking that you're about to tell me that that program was changing and  it was it was moving towards being something else more of a farm that was feeding the school  
**[1:27:51-1:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:27:51):**  or did I misread that?  No, no.  Yeah, I knew that's where you were going.  
**[1:27:55-1:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:27:55):**  But no point that's not the case.  Now, I know that Houston ISD is making strides in that they recently just before COVID, I'm  sure it got pushed back, but just before COVID, they were hiring like 20 something farm managers  
**[1:28:10-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:28:10):**  to manage several small market gardens across the district that would all of the produce  would go into the into the cafeteria system.  They had Houston ISD as a central processing center for their cafeteria system.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:28:25):**  So all the deliveries go to one place.  It gets further processed there and then kind of gets in a heat up and serve situation gets  pushed out.  
**[1:28:34-1:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:28:34):**  Right.  So we obviously in that type of situation, quality concerns become a thing.  And so the thing that they proposed was all of these market gardens around or small farms  
**[1:28:45-1:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:28:45):**  around the district and all that produce going fresh to that processing center to be pushed  out.  Which is awesome.  
**[1:28:54-1:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:28:54):**  I can see why that makes sense, especially a lot of school kitchens aren't what I remember  from being in school in the 80s and 90s.  Lunch ladies baked their own bread.  
**[1:29:06-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:29:06):**  They're in there at five o'clock in the morning, baking rolls for lunch.  They don't do that anymore.  Everything is take it from the box and heat and serve.  
**[1:29:16-1:29:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:29:16):**  Boil it, heat it, put it in a bag.  So have you had any luck getting into supplying schools?  No, no.  
**[1:29:25-1:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:29:25):**  My family, my uncle had a contract for a while with Louisiana Department of Education for  green beans, of all things.  But this is I mean, you know, this is one of those huge contracts.  
**[1:29:40-1:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:29:40):**  You know, this is this is a lot of green beans.  This is a whole situation.  They want to know they can get truckloads of green beans every year.  
**[1:29:48-1:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:29:48):**  This is actually that with those beans are being sent to a processing facility and that  processing facility was selling it to the department.  So no, maybe in the future, you know, me personally, I mean, if we could sell everything in a CSA,  
**[1:30:07-1:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:30:07):**  that's just way easier.  That's just way easier.  There's no reason to mess with anything else personally.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:30:15):**  You know, as producers, and I'm sure you can both agree with me on this one, as producers,  there we have to draw a line between our philosophical operational beliefs and financial real realism.  Yes.  
**[1:30:32-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:30:32):**  Oh, and so would it be awesome if everything that that all of us grew in this area went  to the school district and they used in the perfect way?  And all the food waste came back to a perfect composting system and yeah.  
**[1:30:51-1:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:30:51):**  But for sure nobody would be making any money.  You know, and there's just less threshold for error.  I mean, there's just, there's a lot of stuff that goes into that, you know, and at the  
**[1:31:05-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:31:05):**  scale we're at, it's like if we could sell everything to 100 people in bags every week,  that's a whole lot financially.  That's a whole lot more.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:31:20):**  It's better than going to the market.  You mentioned earlier, profit margins of markets are super low and they are.  By the time you add in getting ready the night before, going and getting everything loaded  
**[1:31:31-1:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:31:31):**  up, setting up your stand, rolling the dice on whether people show up or not.  And then what you have to account for loss versus having 100 people who prepaid for the  season.  
**[1:31:45-1:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:31:45):**  Absolutely.  I mean, it's not even a question really.  It's not even a question.  
**[1:31:53-1:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:31:53):**  It shouldn't be for any produce, any small produce producer.  I'm telling you, it shouldn't be a question if you're listening right now.  Farmer Froberg's official advice, farmers markets are for advertising, focused on e-commerce  
**[1:32:10-1:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:32:10):**  and pre-sell boxes.  Farmers markets where you have to start.  CSA, your farm share boxes, that's where you should be moving to unless your product is  
**[1:32:20-1:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:32:20):**  shelf stable, then see where you can ship it.  We would love to stimulate local as much as we can.  But again, sometimes that's a romantic dream.  
**[1:32:28-1:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:32:28):**  Especially if you're marketing a shelf stable product and you're having trouble selling  it.  On one hand, there's the ideal.  
**[1:32:36-1:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:32:36):**  The world in which we would all like it to be and everybody's version is going to be  a little bit different.  There's the path that we feel the world is on and there's the way the world exists now.  
**[1:32:52-1:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:32:52):**  There's no reason that while we're building our better world that we can't take advantage  of the things in the world as they exist today.  Things like cheap shipping.  
**[1:33:06-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:33:06):**  But we need to always keep in mind that part of our mission should be we need to be growing  this and supporting this local.  But if I have customers that are in New York that want my stuff, I'm going to ship to New  
**[1:33:20-1:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:33:20):**  York, especially if they're willing to pay a premium.  There you go.  I mean, yeah, exactly.  
**[1:33:28-1:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:33:28):**  If and it all boils back down to that philosophical sustainability versus that financial sustainability.  I would say sustainability regeneration, it's not sustainable or regenerative unless we  know what we're going to do with it when we're not here anymore.  
**[1:33:52-1:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:33:52):**  Yep, that's a good point.  And that question now more than ever, especially with truck style farms, as we've been talking  about, that question is completely up in the air.  
**[1:34:03-1:34:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:34:03):**  We have people who are on fifth generation truck farms that they have no idea what they're  going to do whenever whoever's running it at the time is going to stop.  And then on the flip side, you have first gens out here that are doing an incredible  
**[1:34:20-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:34:20):**  job.  There's zero succession plan.  You know, so, yeah, that's that's why the concepts of some people are calling them community  
**[1:34:34-1:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:34:34):**  farms or or agri hoods.  It's a good concept.  We like that concept.  
**[1:34:43-1:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:34:43):**  And so this is when you have a community supported farm.  Right.  And a lot of times it's formed as a nonprofit.  
**[1:34:50-1:35:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:34:50):**  And so ever changing boards that will live on that can help fundraise, you know, changing  hands, of course.  Right.  
**[1:35:01-1:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:01):**  Oftentimes we see farms like this as starting points for young growers that heavily rely  on CSA models that those are the ones that what you're talking about, that'll be here  100 years from now.  
**[1:35:14-1:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:14):**  You know, if they had their land donated to them or they had the ability to pay the land  off because they're a group of people, a nonprofit or something like that.  It's probably not affordable now to go buy land and to start a truck farm like you have.  
**[1:35:31-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:31):**  No, that's the number one question we got with the training program is like all that  is great.  But if you've taught someone and then they don't have anywhere to grow.  
**[1:35:40-1:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:40):**  And so the business model was we have to find them free land like that's not a question.  Like that's what has to happen.  Right.  
**[1:35:48-1:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:48):**  Yeah.  And I get that.  And like so land use.  
**[1:35:57-1:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:35:57):**  Land use is tied to ownership.  You know, ownership gets to determine use and control.  And that's that to a large part is that like a lot of a psychological appeal.  
**[1:36:08-1:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:08):**  I want to own this dirt.  It is mine.  It is my domain is my domain.  
**[1:36:12-1:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:12):**  Do as I wish with it.  And to some extent, I think the natives that were in the habit of this continent long before  you and I were even happy dreams.  
**[1:36:25-1:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:25):**  They had it right.  You know, they didn't believe in ownership.  They didn't.  
**[1:36:29-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:29):**  They didn't even really have much of a word for it.  Their concept was more akin to the stewardship of the land that they were just put here to  take care of it and shepherd its natural resources.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:41):**  So you know, and that's that's what's at the core of a lot of what we've been talking about  about regenerative agriculture that we want to just take care of the natural resources.  Hobbs Hobbs likes to say nature plus one, you know, or a loose grip on nature, you know,  
**[1:36:59-1:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:36:59):**  to gently guide her or to gently let her lead you.  Yep.  And we have this idea that that sometimes a political boundary, a line on a map makes  
**[1:37:14-1:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:37:14):**  a pest stop or that, you know, soil doesn't exist on the other side of that fence that  our management decisions don't necessarily affect our neighbors.  And that's, that's not really true.  
**[1:37:27-1:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:37:27):**  What do you what do you have to say about that?  I kind of rambled for a minute.  Well, so first and foremost is the truck farming industry trend now is what we're talking about.  
**[1:37:37-1:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:37:37):**  And so the the kind of cult leaders like Curtis Stone, for example, he's a guy I don't know  if you're familiar with him, but he's a guy he's he got famous, not fame, but internet  famous, if you will, educationally famous by leasing people's backyards and neighborhoods.  
**[1:37:56-1:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:37:56):**  And so, you know, he was growing up to two acres of vegetables, which doesn't sound like  a lot when you're in other industries, but two acres of vegetables for a lot of vegetables,  a lot of vegetables.  
**[1:38:07-1:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:38:07):**  And that was the equivalent of back.  So it's two acres of backyards.  So picture, eight, whatever backyards that he had his little bike on, and he would going  
**[1:38:18-1:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:38:18):**  around raising vegetables that way.  And the only thing people asked him for return was a crop share.  Right.  
**[1:38:26-1:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:38:26):**  So he had a weekly little bag of vegetables on the front door, and they didn't have to  know.  It's a win win.  
**[1:38:33-1:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:38:33):**  And so that kind of really popularized a can we grow produce anywhere?  And B, do we have to own the land?  Like, hey, go knock on that guy's door.  
**[1:38:49-1:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:38:49):**  Like he's got this huge area.  He's got this three acre yard, and all he does is mow it.  The worst he's going to say is no, or, you know, get the heck off my property.  
**[1:39:04-1:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:39:04):**  I have this vision in my head.  There's another person that I've been visiting with that we're trying to get her schedule  synced up to be a guest.  
**[1:39:13-1:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:39:13):**  But given too much away, he kind of, he gorilla grazes sheep, like in urban environments,  like on sidewalks and backyard parks and road right of ways.  So I'm kind of combining that concept with your gorilla gardening concept.  
**[1:39:35-1:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:39:35):**  You know, I see these backyards, you know, different vegetables and maybe a corn patch  there, then a guy's coming through with his sheep and grazing sheep down the margin, then  keeping the weeds trimmed out.  
**[1:39:46-1:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:39:46):**  Then somebody comes, then there's the neighborhood chickens that run around.  And yeah, so like, imagine, imagine if so imagine if you're driving to one of these  neighborhoods, right?  
**[1:39:58-1:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:39:58):**  And you took away the fences, what would you I mean, what would you have, right?  It would be a bunch of houses with just these large strips of open land.  And so we, we think of this ground is like as smaller than it actually is, because there's  
**[1:40:13-1:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:40:13):**  little fences around it, you know,  take away the fences, how will I know where, where what I own is?  Well, and that's the interesting concept, right?  
**[1:40:22-1:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:40:22):**  The goal of a lot of these guys is to get three or four houses in a row, where everyone  in that area is on board, right?  Because the minute you pop up a greenhouse in someone's driveway, now I should preface  
**[1:40:32-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:40:32):**  like this is not how I grow.  This is just what I've seen.  Right.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:40:37):**  But the minute I the minute you pop up a greenhouse, someone's driveway in one of these neighborhood  settings, I imagine people are gonna be very happy about it.  And so it is like what you're talking about, you got to get everybody on board with it,  
**[1:40:49-1:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:40:49):**  you know, but that wasn't necessarily what we were teaching our people.  But we were teaching them like, look, the idea might be, hey, maybe there is a large  produce farm somewhere that you go and say, hey, I just need an acre.  
**[1:41:06-1:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:41:06):**  Like an acre will support my, you know, 75 person CSA.  And an acre off one of these really, really large farms might not be that much for them.  You know, that might not be out of the question.  
**[1:41:21-1:41:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:41:21):**  We have one guy who went on to the city of San Antonio, and he got a contract with the  city of San Antonio Parks and Rec to use unused park areas to grow vegetables, which is a  big push right now for local governments.  
**[1:41:34-1:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:41:34):**  You have local municipalities that, you know, they own their some of these municipalities  own 500 acre tracks that they bought.  And there's nothing planned for it for 10 years on the master plan or 15 years on the  
**[1:41:49-1:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:41:49):**  master plan.  Right.  And so there's lots of ideas and big pushes on whether it be a lottery system or an application  
**[1:41:58-1:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:41:58):**  system or something for people to be able to apply and say no, like, let us use that  land with with guidelines.  Now, there's actually some positives to this, believe it or not, when you don't know the  
**[1:42:10-1:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:10):**  land, generally, it comes with the stipulation of no permanent infrastructure.  And so what you have is a group of young vegetable producers who aren't going into debt.  Right.  
**[1:42:24-1:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:24):**  Right.  Because they're buying a $1200 shipping container, and everything that they own for their operation  has to be able to fit in that shipping container.  
**[1:42:32-1:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:32):**  And when you do that, you don't spend a lot of money.  Yeah, if all you got is a 20 foot by eight foot box, it's get pretty picky about what  you can put in there.  
**[1:42:43-1:42:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:43):**  Yeah.  And then about what you're spending your money on and you're not constructing this huge metal  barn to put everything in.  
**[1:42:50-1:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:50):**  Right.  And you're not.  It's a it's an interesting concept.  
**[1:42:55-1:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:42:55):**  I like it.  I hope it can.  We need to bring back small scale food production to everywhere.  
**[1:43:03-1:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:43:03):**  I mean, it's not just one of those things that's that we just need in the Houston area.  I mean, we literally need it in every urban environment.  Well, not just urban environment, right?  
**[1:43:16-1:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:43:16):**  Generally what we see is there's less food access in rural areas.  Right, when you Yeah, and so we most people, when they think agriculture, they think food,  but what they don't realize is you go into these huge agricultural areas and there's  
**[1:43:32-1:43:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:43:32):**  virtually no food being produced.  There's agriculture surrounded by farms.  Yeah, we don't eat dead corn and soybeans.  
**[1:43:40-1:43:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:43:40):**  Correct.  And so, yeah, it's not just an urban environment thing.  This is a people thing, right?  
**[1:43:47-1:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:43:47):**  This is a this is a people thing.  And so and, you know, I'm always the first one to say, look, our food system is the way  it is, because at least right now, no one's willing to do it differently.  
**[1:44:01-1:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:01):**  And so we have to grow within those constraints, you know, especially large scale food production.  Now, it's gonna take a lot.  You know, so what what does a better food production system look like to Tyler Froberg?  
**[1:44:17-1:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:17):**  You're in charge.  I just made you I just I just made you the king of everything.  The king of food.  
**[1:44:25-1:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:25):**  The king of everything.  Fix the food system, Tyler.  How do you?  
**[1:44:28-1:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:28):**  And so you all have heard me talk about people, right?  And I always go into a conversation like this with you have to think about the people first.  And what that means is that we have very, very large conventional farms that are supporting  
**[1:44:43-1:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:43):**  families.  And so I think there's a lot of guys out there who would immediately go, well, we have to  cut all these people because we don't like the way that they grow food or produce or  
**[1:44:51-1:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:51):**  what they're doing with the land.  They have kids the same way we do.  So I don't know that that's the answer.  
**[1:44:57-1:45:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:44:57):**  Right.  And I'm not a I'm not a person that even if I'm the king of the world thinks that I can  make a decision and I'm going to go to sleep.  
**[1:45:05-1:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:05):**  And when I wake up, everything's going to be everything's going to change because I  said it needed to change.  Nothing great.  
**[1:45:14-1:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:14):**  I don't think nothing successful ever came from us making a decision and changing it  overnight and then it happening.  Right.  
**[1:45:23-1:45:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:23):**  I think if they're.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:45:27-1:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:27):**  So any type of change I don't know is what I'm getting at.  I'm walking around.  I don't know what that looks like.  
**[1:45:33-1:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:33):**  Here's what I know.  Here's what I know is that our country I'm going to stick to United States for a second.  Our country is full of really, really talented producers.  
**[1:45:45-1:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:45:45):**  Whether they're growing conventionally grown dead corn in Iowa, organic lettuce in Southern  California or, you know, apples in New York, whatever the case may be.  We're hosting milk cows in Washington State.  
**[1:46:01-1:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:01):**  Oh, yeah.  Didn't want to leave out the dairy guys.  Yeah.  
**[1:46:05-1:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:05):**  We there are really, really talented producers nationwide.  And I think if we were going to change things, the first and foremost is recognizing everybody's  strengths and let's see how we can evaluate our food system, produce healthier, more nutritious  
**[1:46:29-1:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:29):**  food that, you know, all while being good stewards of the land and playing to everyone's  strengths.  And again, what that looks like.  
**[1:46:37-1:46:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:37):**  I'm not a I'm not an economist.  You know what I mean?  I what that actually looks like.  
**[1:46:42-1:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:42):**  I don't know.  But I can tell you again, I have a saying and it goes, farmers as farmers.  And again, it's because I'm a people person.  
**[1:46:51-1:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:46:51):**  Right.  We can disagree on our growing styles.  But I still recognize that you have a family to feed and you have all your people you're  
**[1:47:01-1:47:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:01):**  supporting and.  Yeah, that's my spiel on that.  I believe I believe a different food system is possible.  
**[1:47:10-1:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:10):**  And I believe the people currently producing can produce in that food system.  We just have to play to everybody's strengths and gosh, everybody's got to get on the same  page.  
**[1:47:23-1:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:23):**  I think you're right.  You know, I think that everybody currently growing food or in agriculture has a place  in agriculture in the future.  
**[1:47:32-1:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:32):**  Nobody's looking to push anybody else out.  But you know, and I'm not sure what page you were talking about being on.  I'm pretty sure that page has the words soil health, you know, health of the planet somewhere  
**[1:47:49-1:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:49):**  is on that page.  And you know, that's what we got to agree on.  And that's what we got to start thinking about in terms of how we're producing our food and  
**[1:47:59-1:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:47:59):**  ultimately how we're taking care of our planet.  Because how we produce our food is irrevocably intertwined into the health of our planet.  And I'm starting to stumble over five syllables.  
**[1:48:13-1:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:48:13):**  No, I probably time to quit.  I have one more comment to what you just said.  And, you know, I think what we see is that again, there's all these producers out there  
**[1:48:22-1:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:48:22):**  who are really good at what they do, whether they're producing the way other people think  they should or not.  They are really good at what they're currently doing.  
**[1:48:32-1:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:48:32):**  And so, of course, we see people who are stubborn.  We see people who are just doing it the way they know how to do it.  We see people doing it even if they learned recently, it's the way that they learned.  
**[1:48:46-1:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:48:46):**  And so you said it earlier, it starts at the top.  You know, if we're going to change the way we grow, if we're going to change the way  our food system works, we're going to change the interweb of everything that is agriculture.  
**[1:48:58-1:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:48:58):**  It's got to start way up here.  Like it's got to, you know.  We got there's got to quit the insides, right?  
**[1:49:08-1:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:08):**  We tend to just as a species, we draw lines for everything.  We're a tribal species.  Yeah, there's this and that.  
**[1:49:17-1:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:17):**  There's you and me, you know.  But successful tribes, there's more than two.  I mean, with two, it's a binary.  
**[1:49:25-1:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:25):**  I'm right, you're wrong.  Sure, we have if we had 10 tribes.  It's building consensus, it's coming to agreement, it's sharing common goals.  
**[1:49:35-1:49:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:35):**  It's not us versus them.  And I would say that we need more of that and bringing it full circle.  I think what you just said is the goal of my five farm pack videos.  
**[1:49:52-1:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:52):**  Okay.  Right.  That is one of the goals.  
**[1:49:55-1:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:49:55):**  It's like, well, maybe this person here didn't even know this person existed and now they  do and maybe they'll have a conversation.  I know I've been exposed to a couple of good creators from your content where you've shared  
**[1:50:12-1:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:50:12):**  other people and maybe you'll share some good podcasts, do a five favorite podcasts video.  That's a good idea.  I like that.  
**[1:50:23-1:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:50:23):**  Okay, I see.  Yeah, here's my top five farm podcasts.  I could work something up there.  
**[1:50:33-1:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:50:33):**  I can tell you though, if I put a ton of planning into it, it's not going to go by.  It's only if I am driving in the field and I look at something and go, oh, I should video  that and I spent 30 seconds making it.  
**[1:50:51-1:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:50:51):**  Those are the ones that go by.  The ones that I spent weeks planning and just not to keep dragging out with stories, but  I did one video and it's the video that I'm most proud about ever in the history.  
**[1:51:01-1:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:51:01):**  It'll always be the video I'm most proud about unless something crazy happens in my life.  I spent three months gathering shots from people all over the world of them getting  tossed a tomato, catching it, holding it in the air, saying how they say tomato and then  
**[1:51:20-1:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:51:20):**  throwing it.  And y'all are both looking at me because neither one of you have seen the video.  I say tomato with a California dialect.  
**[1:51:33-1:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:51:33):**  I am laughing at it because it makes me sick sometimes because I knew that if there was  going to be a video that I was going to be remembered for, it was going to be this one.  I was going to be the guy who brought the, and I had the most random people you've ever  
**[1:51:47-1:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:51:47):**  seen.  Most of them were not in the ag industry, right?  People all over the world.  
**[1:51:52-1:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:51:52):**  I had at least 10 countries on there, all over the world.  Most of them didn't speak English when I was messaging them.  I had to use a Google translator.  
**[1:52:02-1:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:02):**  I probably sent no exaggeration.  I probably sent 200 messages to people and 90% of them never got answered.  I spent so much time putting this together, begging people to reshoot it because the angle  
**[1:52:14-1:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:14):**  wasn't right, or flipping the video to try to make it work and using enhancement apps  to try to clear the video up because the shot they sent me was like all of these things.  I put so much work into this and it was flop.  
**[1:52:29-1:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:29):**  Oh really?  And again, I say that because I'm looking at you and I could tell neither one of you  saw the video.  
**[1:52:36-1:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:36):**  Like for sure.  I guarantee you.  Sounds cool.  
**[1:52:39-1:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:39):**  Okay.  My defense.  I'm not really on TikTok.  
**[1:52:42-1:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:42):**  Well, Brian, I'm sure you've seen the video where I zipped the jacket up.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, because it's a dumb video that took me 30 seconds to make.  
**[1:52:52-1:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:52:52):**  Right.  And I zipped the jacket up in cadence to a song.  But I spent, and I say it didn't go, it got like half a million views over like six weeks,  
**[1:53:02-1:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:02):**  which is a good video.  And I'm so like, again, this will always be the video.  I'd be stoked about that.  
**[1:53:08-1:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:08):**  No, it is.  I probably sound like a huge brat.  This was the video that I knew like this was going to be it.  
**[1:53:20-1:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:20):**  Like I could shut my account down because it was just going to go crazy and everybody  was going to love it.  And it was, you know, it represented everything that is good in humanity, right?  
**[1:53:31-1:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:31):**  It represented all sorts of countries, diversity, all sorts of races, everything that you can  think of it.  It had tomatoes, like everything that you could think of.  
**[1:53:43-1:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:43):**  And it was everybody was smiling in it like it was happy.  And you know, it didn't go super viral, but that's okay.  I know, I know how that feels.  
**[1:53:55-1:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:53:55):**  You put time into a video and you'll make sure the captions and everything's just right.  And like seven people see it.  And nobody comments.  
**[1:54:04-1:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:04):**  And you're like, just get all depressed.  Like I put so much time into that.  Nobody likes it.  
**[1:54:09-1:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:09):**  Then the 30 second video that you're not proud of that you're just kind of, maybe I'll just  throw it up there.  It's like viral.  
**[1:54:15-1:54:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:15):**  Brian, the throw and cheese one.  I stole that.  I did one where I, it was my son's idea.  
**[1:54:29-1:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:29):**  And I pretended to be a circus peanut farmer.  I did that one was good.  I did this whole thing.  
**[1:54:37-1:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:37):**  Right.  And again, this was one of those that I thought this is going to go like mega viral.  Like I don't have a doubt in my mind that this one's going to go mega viral.  
**[1:54:47-1:55:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:54:47):**  Like if you didn't see the video, I like, I was growing peanuts at the time and I had  taken circus peanuts and like stuck them on the peanut plant and then buried it.  So I pulled this peanut plant out of the ground or circus peanuts all over it.  
**[1:55:02-1:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:02):**  And I filmed it like it was a documentary.  Like when I answered the questions that I was asking myself, I like face like this.  I'm like, well, you know, we're fourth generation circus peanuts.  
**[1:55:11-1:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:11):**  Like it was eloquently shot.  I mean, again, it was one of those that like 250, 300,000 after a couple of months, but  like it didn't go mega viral.  
**[1:55:24-1:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:24):**  You know, my core people who usually watch the video saw it.  That was, yeah, sounds about right.  So speaking of social media, I've got most of your links ready to put in the show notes,  
**[1:55:38-1:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:38):**  TikTok, Facebook, Instagram.  I even found your Twitter profile.  Yep.  
**[1:55:45-1:55:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:45):**  I'm Farmer Froberg on everything.  I made it easy.  Consistent branding.  
**[1:55:49-1:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:49):**  Love it.  Farmer Froberg on everything.  And then of course, goodlivingcompany.com.  
**[1:55:58-1:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:55:58):**  Make sure that gets into show notes.  If you want to taste the simple life.  Taste the simple life.  
**[1:56:08-1:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:56:08):**  That is the episode title.  I've been kind of struggling with that.  Taste the simple life.  
**[1:56:15-1:56:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:56:15):**  I like it.  Got anything you want to put me on a spot about?  You want to meet CK?  
**[1:56:23-1:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:56:23):**  Let's see.  So I actually, I was walking around earlier and I was like, I need to think of, I have  this habit of asking questions to people who are asking me questions.  
**[1:56:34-1:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:56:34):**  And I'm going to be honest, I was really busy earlier and I didn't get to think, but I do  have one thing to leave everybody with if that's all right.  So I always say this in anything that I do, and I don't mean to sound cliche, but two  
**[1:56:53-1:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:56:53):**  years ago I didn't have an ounce of social media.  And I, in a way, I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up.  If you will, I knew I wanted to work in agriculture, but I really didn't know.  
**[1:57:06-1:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:06):**  And TikTok has showed me, and this sounds crazy, but TikTok, in my opinion, has showed  me that truly anything is possible.  And I don't mean to sound cliche, but two years ago, if you'd asked me, hey, are you  
**[1:57:22-1:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:22):**  going to be on the weather channel once a month?  Like talking about what's seasonal in your area?  Or did you know that you're going to own your own business with a guy in Nebraska selling  
**[1:57:32-1:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:32):**  farm fresh stuff?  Or hey, you're going to have 600,000 followers on this app that people are generally dancing  on.  
**[1:57:40-1:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:40):**  Yeah, that people do stupid dances on.  Yeah.  I would have been like, no.  
**[1:57:45-1:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:45):**  And there's so many other doors that I can't even talk about yet.  Yeah.  That are getting open.  
**[1:57:52-1:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:57:52):**  That might be open.  And so if you're on the fence about something in your life, just do it.  Like if you have, if the only reason you're not doing it is because of doubt in yourself,  
**[1:58:09-1:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:58:09):**  that's generally called imposter syndrome and everybody goes through it and just do  it because you, if I, if I could do it, if this kid from Alvin, Texas can do it, then  chances are anybody listening to this podcast right now can absolutely do it.  
**[1:58:28-1:58:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:58:28):**  And like, you know, you see people on these apps and I think people associate what their  life is actually like and that their life is somehow different and it's not right.  All of these people who are building their dreams, it all started with one decision to  
**[1:58:45-1:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:58:45):**  do something.  And so whatever that decision needs to be for you today, knock it out.  Life is too short and the worst that's going to happen is you're going to be in the same  
**[1:58:56-1:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:58:56):**  place you are right now with a new dream to try to achieve or the same dream in a different  way.  There's two reasons you don't find success.  
**[1:59:06-1:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:59:06):**  You don't start looking for it and you quit too early.  Bingo, if I had stopped making content every time a video flopped, I'd had like a thousand  followers.  
**[1:59:23-1:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:59:23):**  The viral ones are harder for me.  Like just because, just because that little bit of negative feedback, I mean, yeah, like  the positive, the positivity, there's every video that's got negative feedback.  
**[1:59:34-1:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:59:34):**  There's always a ton of people that you have overwhelming positive vibes, but sometimes  the negativity gets to me on the viral videos and they're a little bit harder on me than  like just reaching my normal core audience.  
**[1:59:45-1:59:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:59:45):**  Can I say one more thing?  Sorry, I know we're like way over to the negative comments.  You don't even have all the time that you have.  
**[1:59:54-2:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=1:59:54):**  You don't even have to put this in the show.  This could just be us talking.  But my very first video that I ever posted was when I was an ag teacher.  
**[2:00:02-2:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:02):**  I wasn't an ag teacher anymore, but I videoed it when I was at teaching and I had taken  a group of kids to Tarleton state for a livestock judging contest.  And anytime we went anywhere, I always like to take the kids on a field trip.  
**[2:00:16-2:00:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:16):**  And we were, while they were judging, I went and drove around and I found the Tarleton  state dairy facility and went and I said, Hey, I got nine high school kids with me.  What can we come and do?  
**[2:00:27-2:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:27):**  She said, if you can get here by four, they can run the milking parlor.  I said, we'll be here.  Take this group of high.  
**[2:00:34-2:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:34):**  I didn't tell them, right.  Take this group of high school kids, we all milked a cow.  Anyways, the video is from that.  
**[2:00:40-2:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:40):**  It's me hooking up a cow.  So the very first video that I posted on Tik TOK got 10,000 views, right?  And there's a couple of comments on there.  
**[2:00:49-2:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:49):**  Why'd you do it like that?  How you hooked that up wrong?  What kind of parlor is that?  
**[2:00:54-2:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:00:54):**  What are you wearing?  I remember thinking, these people are jerks.  What's the deal?  
**[2:01:01-2:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:01):**  And I made a few more, you know, they didn't do anything.  And then the next viral video was, and again, I wasn't, I didn't know what Tik TOK was or  what I was going to be doing on Tik TOK.  
**[2:01:13-2:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:13):**  And so I made a snack that I make it's a chia pudding.  So you take chia seed and honey and yeah, milk and leave it overnight, whatever.  And I don't know, it got, it got, you know, a hundred thousand views or something.  
**[2:01:28-2:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:28):**  I was ecstatic and people were saying stuff on it.  What are you doing?  Why are you mixing it that way?  
**[2:01:36-2:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:36):**  Why would you use that brand?  Why did you do this?  That brand sucks.  
**[2:01:40-2:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:40):**  You should try this brand.  These people are jerks.  And then the next viral video is the same, like people saying stuff.  
**[2:01:47-2:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:01:47):**  And then I just realized that like, man, people say stuff.  And again, that's where I made the decision that like, I just wasn't gonna, I wasn't even  gonna, I'm not going to delete them because I want them to know sometimes I'll like them.  
**[2:02:02-2:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:02):**  I want them to know that I saw them.  I saw it.  No reaction.  
**[2:02:07-2:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:07):**  Yeah, no reaction whatsoever.  And my next video, I'm going to be just as smiling.  Right?  
**[2:02:14-2:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:14):**  Good.  I get a lot of, not a lot, every now and again, I'll get people make comments about  my belt buckles.  
**[2:02:19-2:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:19):**  Right?  So I showed, I showed in high school.  So I have a various assortment of belt buckles that I in fact, wine, but because I'm a vegetable  
**[2:02:29-2:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:29):**  farmer, apparently I'm not supposed to wear a belt buckle.  And again, I don't, I don't make any comment, but I do make an effort to always have my  shirt tucked in so everyone can see that.  
**[2:02:40-2:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:40):**  So cowboy hat, see if they melt down because vegetable farmers are supposed to wear.  I know.  I know.  
**[2:02:49-2:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:02:49):**  It's fantastic.  Can I also say though, is it's always usually just a reflection of, of the negativity is  always a reflection of who they are being mirrored onto you guys.  
**[2:03:02-2:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:03:02):**  So I think that's something I also have to remind myself too, when I get any kind of  criticism is, wow, this is really just a reflection of you and how your brain works and not necessarily  what I have done or decided not to do.  
**[2:03:21-2:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:03:21):**  I hear a lot, I think a lot of criticism is often said to a mirror without people being  self-aware that there's a mirror.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:32-2:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:03:32):**  You know, there it's a lot of criticism is, is self-criticism I think.  And people are just afraid to confront that about themselves.  And it's easier to lash out to a random internet person that they'll never have any sort of  
**[2:03:47-2:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:03:47):**  personal connection to and probably never ever interact with again.  It's a quick and easy serotonin burst boost just to be addicted to that person and move  on with your day.  
**[2:03:59-2:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:03:59):**  Yeah.  And honestly what I found is, is I think people know that I don't respond to stuff like that.  Like I think now it's like, it's well enough known.  
**[2:04:10-2:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:10):**  And in fact, like, you know, I never do, obviously like I don't do dances or anything like that.  Yesterday, we're out at our new ground.  One of my buddies is over there helping me with some stuff.  
**[2:04:19-2:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:19):**  And he was like, dude, let's do this dance.  He likes to do real goofy stuff.  I'm not doing that.  
**[2:04:24-2:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:24):**  So let's just do it.  I did it.  Not a single negative comment on this video of, and I would think that that would be like  
**[2:04:31-2:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:31):**  a target, right?  Like I'm standing on top of a farm all and he's on the ground and we're like perfectly  in sync doing this dance.  
**[2:04:43-2:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:43):**  Not a single, not a single bad comment.  They're all like, yeah, I go.  If you post a picture of you driving a pickup and shifting from one gear to another, somebody  
**[2:04:52-2:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:52):**  will tell you you're doing it wrong.  That's that's fair.  That's fair.  
**[2:04:58-2:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:04:58):**  Tyler.  It has been an absolute blast.  My man.  
**[2:05:01-2:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:01):**  Absolutely.  Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you all for having me.  
**[2:05:07-2:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:07):**  This was great.  Hopefully we'll talk to y'all again soon.  CK, anything on your mind before we go?  
**[2:05:13-2:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:13):**  No, I just, a lot of gratitude.  This week is Thanksgiving.  So I just think I have a lot of gratitude for having you on.  
**[2:05:20-2:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:20):**  Just also seeing more of where our food comes from and just the similarities we have in  different climates.  So it's just interesting to learn about something that's not just beef too.  
**[2:05:30-2:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:30):**  So it's nice.  I love it.  We're going to go ahead and get right out of here guys.  
**[2:05:36-2:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:36):**  All right.  Thank you all very much.  Red Hills Rancher, y'all have a good week and remind me to shake the hand that feeds  
**[2:05:42-2:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/41-Tyler-Froberg-Taste-the-Simple-Life-e1ath1k#t=2:05:42):**  you.

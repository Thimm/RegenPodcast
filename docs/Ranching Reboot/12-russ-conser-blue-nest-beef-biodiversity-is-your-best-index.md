Today's guest is a gentleman I've known for quite a while.  We've had some very interesting conversations off the podcast about energy flows and carbon  
**[0:01:01-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:01:01):**  and carbon storage and where it actually comes from deep down in the soil.  We talk about what it means to regenerate land and how you can't fool the birds.  With me as always is my co-pilot CK.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:01:18):**  Be sure to stick around to the end of the podcast for a special offer from today's guest.  So today we have Russ Konzer.  Welcome to the show Russ.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:01:27):**  Tell us about yourself and where you're at these days.  Hey Brian.  Hey CK.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:01:32):**  Hey.  Well I'm at in Houston so it's springtime unlike a couple months ago when it felt like  I was in Montana when Texas was freezing.  
**[0:01:43-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:01:43):**  Whatever that thing was we're still recovering from it.  But yeah still rolling down the same road I've been rolling down with wearing multiple  hats like many people in the regenerative ag industry, president of the Grass Fit Exchange  
**[0:02:02-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:02:02):**  and so that takes some time.  But you know I'm an entrepreneur in space myself here with Blue Nest Beef trying to  close that gap between the regenerative producers and consumers nationwide and kind of making  
**[0:02:18-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:02:18):**  the right thing the easy thing right.  Bring in high quality beef that's doing good things for the world conveniently to doorsteps.  So click online box magically shows up at your door and you get great beef.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:02:35):**  So yeah that's probably you know 90% of my focus is being the entrepreneur now.  It's like all other entrepreneurs trying to make it all work and make the systems work  and tell the story and all that kind of good stuff.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:02:55):**  So before we dive into Blue Nest which I definitely want to talk about, can I hear some more about  your history with energy companies and work in that sector?  Yeah so sorry because I know Brian you know some of that stuff already so I skipped past  
**[0:03:12-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:03:12):**  it.  But yeah my own journey into this space is somewhat unusual I guess in that I tell people  I spent 30 years taking dead carbon out of the ground and now I'm going to spend the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:03:22):**  next 30 putting living carbon back into it.  Oh that's awesome yeah.  And I'm an engineer originally by training group in the Midwest.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:03:30):**  I was a child of the 70s where the issue with energy wasn't climate change and carbon it  was not waiting in gas lines and having your house cold.  And then the issue was how we're going to have enough of it.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:03:43):**  That was my passion.  I love science and engineering.  Chose to go into energy, petroleum, oil and natural gas all around the world.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:03:54):**  And what became relevant in a strange kind of way later was my very very specific specialty  in those early days was the instrumentation models, sampling, all that kind of stuff for  counting carbon in the deep earth.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:04:06):**  So I was literally the guy that would show up when we drilled a well and run all the  tests and say you know we got oil or we don't got oil.  But then you know after kind of doing some traditional production and management stuff  
**[0:04:26-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:04:26):**  helped create a technology venturing business for Shell which I just found wonderful at  this intersection of entrepreneurship, technology and business.  And ended up staying the second half of the 30 year career roughly doing that leading  
**[0:04:46-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:04:46):**  Shell's Angel Stage Breakthrough Energy Investment Group.  And through that we had invested anything you can imagine in energy and many things  you can't.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:04:57):**  I was involved in investing the science and technology associated with that kind of stuff  including carbon sequestration.  So I became immediately intrigued because we had invested in some really really novel  
**[0:05:12-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:05:12):**  ideas for carbon sequestration none of which looked terribly compelling.  And I happened to be at TED there in 2013 when Alan Savory gave his famous talk about  changing how we manage grasslands could sequester carbon.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:05:28):**  And you know I kind of filed his bookmark and through totally serendipitous means it  came back on the radar a couple weeks later when someone introduced me to Peter Bic which  similarly become intrigued.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:05:41):**  So many of the listeners here will know who that is.  And carbon cowboys.  Carbon cowboys, yep, filmmaker.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:05:50):**  So and I went looking for data to support this idea of carbon accumulation in soil.  And I tell people that I can really it was kind of like a JFK moment for me.  I can remember where I was, what I was doing, where I was sitting when I opened up a spreadsheet  
**[0:06:06-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:06:06):**  from Christine Jones who many soil folks will know from Australia.  And the quantity and distribution of organic matter in the soil sample data that she had  sent to me was identical to what we called source rocks in oil and gas.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:06:20):**  That's where carbon comes from in the oil and gas comes from in the deep earth because  the sediments were buried millions of years ago and then buried and cooked under pressure,  temperature and time.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:06:33):**  So wait a minute, you're saying that cow poop builds soil carbon and in a couple hundred  million years soil carbon becomes oil?  Yeah, except for it's not the cow poop really per se.  
**[0:06:45-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:06:45):**  You know, what we now know in terms of soil science is it's the magic is the microbiology.  You know, the soil carbon under regenerative ranches, Christine really coined that term,  the liquid carbon pathway turns out to be important.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:01):**  I think for a long time, we really didn't understand or appreciate, you know, is it  the decomposing plant litter?  Is it the cow poop?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:09):**  What is it?  And the magic is it's the carbon that's coming out through the roots of the plant into the  soil that creates the basis of carbon, the primary basis of carbon accumulation in the  
**[0:07:21-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:21):**  soil and the perennial carbon pump.  It's a perennial carbon pump and the pump happens precisely because the grazing animals  come in, eat off some, not too much, let it rest.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:33):**  And as it's regrowing, that pump gets going.  So think of a cow's mouth is kind of like the pump handle on a pump.  It's literally pulling CO2 out of the air as it goes through that regrow cycle every  
**[0:07:49-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:49):**  time.  So, yeah, I mean, that was kind of a profound moment for me.  It was at the time I had already decided I was going to retire from Shell and go work  
**[0:07:58-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:07:58):**  with energy entrepreneurs to try to solve the other part of the emissions, part of the  energy equation that I just felt like the entrepreneurial world was going to do a better  job of and a more exciting, have some more exciting things to do out there than on the  
**[0:08:13-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:08:13):**  big corporate side.  But in the process, I kept one foot still in this kind of solar carbon world, started  meeting all these wonderful ranchers and farmers.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:08:26):**  And I tell people it started to remind me of what renewable energy looked like about  30 years ago, where like 30 years ago, there were no wind turbines in Texas.  There were no, or Iowa or anything like that.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:08:40):**  And the only person who had a solar panel was your crazy uncle Harry wanted to live  off the grid in Idaho, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:08:46):**  And then-  Do you feel personally attacked, CK?  My husband's from Idaho, Russ.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:08:52):**  So a hundred percent, no, his family are like, they are preppers.  They have a freeze dryer.  So a hundred percent, we own it.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:01):**  It's okay.  30 years ago, solar energy on the roof.  Am I right there?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:05):**  Yeah.  Come to our house.  If you doomsday, we'll be prepped.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:08):**  We're ready.  Yeah, no, which is awesome, right?  So the people that do that, to take that pioneering lead are so fundamentally important.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:15):**  So crazy uncle Harry ought to deserve the credit for getting that kind of stuff started.  But in order for it to actually make a difference, it's got to scale, right?  So how do we scale it?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:28):**  And this is where entrepreneurs and commercial business people come in.  They try to figure out how do we make this go big, right?  So it was the entrepreneurs that came in and said, how do we turn this into something that  
**[0:09:42-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:42):**  can make financial returns?  There's a famous founder of one of the early solar companies by him, and Tigger Shaw.  And he said, I can get up.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:09:51):**  If I'm really good at fundraising, I might be able to attract a billion dollars of philanthropic  money to solve a big problem that helps the planet.  But if I can make that idea make money, I can attract a trillion dollars of capital.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:10:06):**  And if, you know, to me, it applies here as well to this other half of the carbon equation,  if we can make regenerative farming economically attractive for all the participants in that  cycle, that's how we're going to regenerate landscape, not because somebody in Washington  
**[0:10:23-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:10:23):**  passes a law that says you must farm regeneratively or you can't do X.  You can't legislate our way into this, in my view.  Legislation may be important, it may follow, there may be incentives, there may be all  
**[0:10:39-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:10:39):**  kinds of stuff, but I really think it's farmers and people trying to figure out how to market  farm products, they're going to make regenerative agriculture work.  So there you go.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:10:51):**  So that's kind of the backstory on this stuff.  And then later down the road, you know, my own story, you know, became an entrepreneur  myself here in the space along with other folks.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:04):**  So it kind of has that effect on people sucking you in once you see the possibilities, right?  Yup.  They're gravity, not suction, gravity.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:16):**  Yeah.  And for what it's worth, you know, I'll save people the boredom here, but as an energy  guy, I tell people I'm still in the energy business.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:26):**  I'm just in the biological energy business.  Can I ask too?  Sure.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:32):**  How do you answer the question when people say, you know, we don't want to enable the  polluters to keep polluting?  You know, when we're talking about like soil carbon stuff, I think it's really just not  
**[0:11:48-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:48):**  that simple because everything takes energy and it's just what kind of type of energy  are we talking about?  And I was curious how you kind of handle that conversation because you probably have that  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:11:57):**  a lot more often than I ever will.  And it's a long conversation.  Usually involves a glass of wine.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah.  Love it.  Well, everybody likes sound bites these days and everybody wants everything to be black  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:08):**  and short and sweet, right?  I don't know.  Good luck with 90 minute podcasts.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:14):**  So yeah, awesome.  Just dive into it, man.  Yeah, no.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:19):**  Well, and, you know, happy to follow up with stuff.  The dirty little secret of the climate challenge that we face is that even if we were able  to magically cut our emissions to zero today, we still got a problem.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:40):**  That there's an imbalance of carbon in the atmosphere.  See, there's one of the things that people like say is, you know, CO2 is a pollutant.  It's not true at all.  
**[0:12:50-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:12:50):**  Carbon is one of the most fundamental things that makes life go on.  What we have is an imbalance problem.  We have too much carbon in the air where it's a liability and not enough carbon in the soil  
**[0:13:02-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:13:02):**  where it's an asset.  And even some of our language in this space is a problem because the word sequestration  implies that we want to take carbon, lock it up in a vault and hide it away from causing  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:13:20):**  harm.  It's not what we're doing with regenerative farming at all.  We're taking carbon and we're putting it back to work as a part of the living cycle of life  
**[0:13:28-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:13:28):**  in the soil.  So it's kind of like money being invested in a new economy that's carbon driven instead  of money sitting over here as a toxic representation of imbalance.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:13:40):**  So what I tell people, CK, therefore, is we need to simultaneously reduce emissions as  fast as we can and we need to accelerate the uptake of carbon that's already in the air  as fast as we can.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:13:53):**  So we have to do both.  And so absolutely correct.  We cannot use the fact that we're taking up carbon as an excuse to keep pumping it out  
**[0:14:01-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:14:01):**  as fast as we can.  But we have to do both together.  Now, how do we do both together and how do we make these things work?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:14:09):**  It's going to take a lot of learning and experimenting, including with not only on the farm, but through  the whole business cycle of stuff.  So it's one of these things where there's a simple solution which just says cut all  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:14:33):**  the emissions.  Unfortunately, it's not enough.  It's necessary, but not sufficient.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:14:40):**  And of course, maybe one of the things we talk about here, if you want to go there,  that the carbon stuff is really fundamental.  I mean, carbon really is kind of the currency of life on planet Earth.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:14:54):**  And solar energy is what powers that.  But the benefits of regenerative agriculture extend way beyond carbon.  I think the whole community is really beginning to appreciate that this concept of carbon  
**[0:15:11-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:15:11):**  is a co-benefit along with bird habitat, water, warmer prosperity, healthy, more nutritious  food.  And so even though I came in through this carbon door, it's the one that I had the background  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:15:26):**  in.  It's the one that hooked me, the one that grabbed me.  I think it's really, really important.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:15:33):**  It's not the totality of the picture.  So yeah, there you go.  Any of that makes sense at all?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:15:43):**  I mean, I'm going to go down the river.  I agree with that.  I think it's not a reductionist mindset like we talk about.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:15:51):**  It's more systems thinking.  And I think that's the shift that I'm trying to get other people to change is we're not  trying to reduce something.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:16:00):**  We're working in a system.  Yeah, we're working in a system to get the system back in balance again.  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:16:06):**  I did a blog post last year trying to weave some of this big picture stuff together.  And I mean, that's really what it is, is you're trying to get that earth system.  If you kind of, and again, I'm going to really resist the temptation to go down the scientific  
**[0:16:25-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:16:25):**  rabbit hole, but the solution, there's a great quote from Eisenhower that says something  like if I find I can't solve the problem, I make the problem bigger until I reach a  scale where I can see the fundamental dimensions of the problem.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:16:42):**  And he said it much more eloquent than that.  But the gist of it is zoom out so you can see the whole thing.  With regenerative agriculture, if I zoom all the way out to the outer edge of the earth's  
**[0:16:55-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:16:55):**  atmosphere, and I look at planet earth and all the life that sits inside of it, what  I see is a system that has this overwhelmingly abundant flow of energy coming from the sun,  a nuclear reactor, billions of miles away, right?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:17:12):**  And the role of life on earth is to capture as much of that solar energy as possible.  And that's what plant life does.  And then the rest of life on earth, which is you and me and microbes and all the other  
**[0:17:26-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:17:26):**  stuff is cycling that energy over and over again.  Effectively, what we're doing is dissipating that incoming solar energy.  And when I did a factoid early on in my grass fed exchange thing, when I wrote a blog, I  
**[0:17:41-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:17:41):**  like to pull out little things.  And I kind of added up how much US crop land was barren for how much of the year when it  could have been growing a cover crop or something else.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:17:58):**  And I added up how much energy might have been caught in the plant material of that  cover crop or anything else that could have been growing at the time.  And I was surprised to find that the amount of solar energy that doesn't get captured  
**[0:18:15-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:18:15):**  by a growing plant on bare soil during off seasons on farmland is about exactly the same  as the total amount of energy we produce from coal, oil and natural gas every year combined  in this country.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:18:29):**  So it's a massive energy waste.  Those are big scary numbers.  So the fact that something isn't growing when it ought to be growing.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:18:40):**  I mean, of course you can look at satellite photos.  Well, yeah, anytime you fly over like I was flying to Idaho this weekend and I was like,  you know, I cringe now because now I understand it a little better.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:18:51):**  And I'm like, oh, look at all this bare soil.  It's like being nude.  Like it's like covers.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:18:55):**  It's exactly what it is.  And yet you can see that along the edges, you know, we got better and better at plowing  fence line to fence line.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:03):**  Right.  But there's still fence lines.  There's still creeks.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:06):**  You can see that where we haven't thrown in a corn or soybean field, that there is life  growing.  So yeah, it's it's kind of crazy to think that these are the scale of numbers.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:21):**  But I think that's the opportunity to regenerate agriculture, right?  Whether it's in the ranching sector, in the farming sector.  How do we manage lands so that we can increase the amount of solar energy that they capture  
**[0:19:35-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:35):**  in this circle cycle of life?  You know, it's kind of a Lion King thing, right?  You know, except for it doesn't involve a little cute cub.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:43):**  It's this complexity of, sorry for the dog, but it's OK.  We have dogs too.  Not unusual in the Zoom era.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:50):**  I know.  No, it's fine.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:19:54):**  Yeah.  But it's, you know, it's learning, you know, what real regenerative farming heroes here  doing this space is they, you know, it's really fun to watch.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:06):**  Right.  You know, they're just they're observational learners.  And, you know, Brian, I remember, you know, I mean, you've been a pioneer doing stuff  
**[0:20:15-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:15):**  with like fire.  And I think last year, year before you started seeing some beavers show back up on your property.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:24):**  Right.  Oh, they've been there about five, six years.  I just really started kind of telling people about them last year.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:30):**  I think you start paying attention to them too, right?  And it's like, what role do they serve?  What important things?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:37):**  And I think this is the thing that's really cool with the people out on the landscape  is they go from following a set of instructions they got from their local land grant extension  office and they start to watch that cycle again.  
**[0:20:49-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:20:49):**  And they're constantly asking themselves, what can I do to help that cycle flow better?  So it's pretty cool.  And yet, you know, the things I get most involved with are still the science and technology  
**[0:21:03-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:21:03):**  side and the commercial delivery side.  You know, in my romantic world, maybe someday I'll be a farmer, but yeah, probably stick  to the things I'm best at, I guess.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:21:15):**  There's there's definitely a need for people that are connecting regenerative producers  to consumers that are that are asking for the product.  Yeah, I mean, I think that that's a key missing link.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:21:29):**  It's one of these things where we have to figure out how to scale, right?  I really wish we would evolve to a world where every consumer knew their farmer personally,  knew their kids.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:21:44):**  That would be nice.  And there will be some of that.  But I think the majority of Americans will go to the grocery store or order a box online  
**[0:21:54-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:21:54):**  or whatever.  And we have to I think the challenge of the next year regenerative agriculture is figuring  out how do we bring those things together?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:22:03):**  How do we scale in a way that still allows those consumers and farmers that do care about  and want to form those intimate relationships to thrive and work?  But we you know, if we don't figure out how to, you know, back to the renewable energy  
**[0:22:21-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:22:21):**  thing, the language we use 20 years ago is how do we reach what we called grid parity?  Grid parity was the margin where coal energy and natural gas energy trades for electricity  in the market.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:22:33):**  We passed that in about 2012, 13 now.  So that's why coal plants in Texas are continued to be shut down because they're just not economically  competitive anymore.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:22:45):**  And I think what we have to do with regenerative agriculture here on the meat side, at least  is reach feedlot parity in the long run.  And we're only going to do that if we figure out how to scale some of these systems.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:22:56):**  Now, that doesn't really mean like we have to have mega ranches everywhere.  You know, it's not like create the pasture equivalent of CAFO is everywhere.  But we do have to build systems that, you know, can aggregate supply, process that supply,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:23:13):**  package that supply, market that supply.  And the quality from the producer has to be also be consistent.  Yeah, it's one of the things I've learned here with our Blue Nest experience.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:23:27):**  It's a privilege to work with pioneers like Todd Churchill.  He's one of the first grass fed beef companies when he founded Thousand Hills Cattle almost  20 years ago now.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:23:38):**  And then processors like we work with primarily with Mike Lawrence and Lawrence Meats in Cannon  Falls, Minnesota, which many people know from Micah Paulins.  You know, because yes, yeah, I'm a worse dilemma.  
**[0:23:51-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:23:51):**  Early pioneering ethical meat processor.  And, you know, you know, Brian is only having that quality.  One of the things I've learned by working with Todd and Mike in this kind of stuff is  
**[0:24:05-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:24:05):**  you have to honor, respect, retain and even enhance the quality all the way from the soil  to the plate.  Right.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:24:15):**  And any step along that way, if you do something not right, you're doing the food a disservice.  And you know, that'll show up as, you know, you know, not tender, not flavorful, other  things like that.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:24:31):**  And we can't be surprised if consumers don't buy a product, you know, that doesn't taste  good.  I mean, I've been doing only regenerative meats in my family's house for almost 10 years  
**[0:24:47-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:24:47):**  now.  And by, you know, becoming an entrepreneur myself in this space, I recognize how the  pros really, you know, they know what they're doing.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:00):**  And we need more pros.  At every stage of the regenerative life cycles, like I said, all the way from the pasture  to the plate.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:08):**  So let's talk some more about Blue Nest Beef.  You guys do a box product, like a box subscription product.  I want you to talk about your Audubon certification.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:22):**  But first, I tried some Bobolinks.  Awesome.  And they're delicious.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:29):**  So I see them there on the table.  So let's talk.  What are Bobolinks, Russ?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:36):**  Bobolinks is the convergence of our mission with a wonderful product that gives us the  opportunity to get out of the freezer and into the pantry.  It's a naturally fermented, 100% grass fed beef snack stick.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:25:51):**  It's made from the same Audubon certified, the beef that comes from Audubon certified  bird friendly land.  But it's preserved with a process of natural fermentation, very much like a sourdough bread,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:05):**  a kombucha.  I'm already sold.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:08):**  I love kombucha.  That natural fermentation does two things for you.  It gives it that extra tang.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:16):**  But it also means you get all the preservation without all the junk, right?  So there's no weird fats or chemicals in there.  And when you bite into it, well, I don't know, Brian, I don't want to put words in your mouth.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:29):**  What do you think?  Is it tender?  Yeah, I think they're good.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:32):**  I think they're good.  I mean, you know, it's a meat stick product, so it's going to be processed.  It's not like you're eating a piece of beef jerky that's a slice of...  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:42):**  That's right.  Other thing.  Oh, I see.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:45):**  So, you know, there is going to be that kind of processed consistency to it.  There's nothing about the Bobolink that I found objectionable.  I mean, they smelled good.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:26:56):**  They tasted good.  They had good mouthfeel.  They didn't leave my mouth feeling greasy like some others do.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:03):**  Good pleasant spice and tasted good.  And I feel good about eating them because a lot of the other, you know, like whole list  of regenerative grass fed bars, well, where are you sourcing your meat from?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:19):**  And you kind of get down to it.  And if you're not eating a...  If it's not an epic bar, you're probably eating Tasmanian or New Zealand beef that's been  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:26):**  imported.  And that's the exact wrong thing to do because I want to support somebody locally doing that,  not somebody in New Zealand doing that.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:34):**  Yeah.  You used exactly the right words, Brian.  Thanks.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:39):**  Because the real aim of Bobolinks is to indeed help you feel good about eating meat sticks  again.  And that feel good is both kind of, you know, it's nourishing and flavorful.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:27:53):**  You don't have the junk in it.  You know, the fermentation part's good, but then you can feel good about helping the farmers,  helping the birds, helping all the other stuff that's a part of the regenerative ag stuff.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:03):**  So we're pretty excited about it.  We just introduced it in March.  So just a little over a month ago.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:12):**  So that means you're one of the first customers.  The package that you got, what I just held up there is really the first stuff off the  press where the feedback has been incredibly positive and we're working now to figure out  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:26):**  how...  Labels and packaging are expensive.  And you know, if somebody...  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:30):**  It's a huge cost.  If somebody is turned off by your current label, they're not your customer anyway.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:37):**  But you know what we need to do, you know, back to the...  But it needs to be appealing.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:42):**  It needs to be eye catching to somebody that isn't already looking for that product.  You need a package that tells a story.  We, you know, maybe here's where I connect in the broader blue nest beef thing.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:28:53):**  The whole idea behind blue nest beef, because all this stuff, you know, carbon, water, all  this regenerative is a multisyllabic word, right?  It's complicated, right?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:29:08):**  The big idea here is to create a business that sits at the intersection of a legitimate  conservation goal, the bird habitat, as well as something that's understandable and meaningful  to consumers.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:29:22):**  Right?  So, who doesn't like a pretty bird singing in the backyard, right?  People can get their mind around that pretty good.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:29:32):**  If I can start a conversation with you about what regenerative is by saying it's good for  birds and then lead you into a story about all the other wonderful good things it does,  you know, the hypothesis of the business is that's a potentially viable pathway into the  
**[0:29:49-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:29:49):**  consumer mindset with regeneration story.  And as a frozen beef business, you know, we have to, in the core of our business, we have  to ship a box and keep it cold and make sure it survives the UPS and FedEx truck and all  
**[0:30:07-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:30:07):**  that kind of stuff.  But as a snack stick, that shell stable, you know, it doesn't have to be cold, you know,  now I can start shipping in mail pouches and we may someday, you know, get into bricks  
**[0:30:21-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:30:21):**  and mortar retail, we can touch consumers at a much lower price point and give them  an even easier bridge into this regenerative story.  That's kind of the strategic logic behind the Bobolink's thing.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:30:34):**  Now that the name is because many people know this if you're not a birder, but the Bobolink  is one of the more endangered grassland birds.  So I don't know if any of them stop in Kansas at your place, Brian, on the way up.  
**[0:30:50-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:30:50):**  I don't know.  I think they're a little more Eastern, a little more Northern typically from you.  They migrate through potentially here literally in the next couple of weeks.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:31:03):**  But they start, they're breeding generally kind of Nebraska, Iowa and parts, you know,  up into Minnesota and Southern Canada.  But they winter down in South America.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:31:17):**  Birds are so darned amazing.  You know, I've always kind of been kind of this, just like most Americans, birds are  pretty, you know, that's really cool.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:31:27):**  One of the things that getting into this business has done for me is like, oh, birds are freaking  amazing.  You know, they really are.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:31:33):**  You know, these little tiny birds will, you know, fly all the way to the other end of  the earth because that's what they're wired to do and come back again.  And what's especially important and true in the regenerative context is, you know, I can  
**[0:31:50-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:31:50):**  fool the auditor.  I can comply with all kinds of rules for regeneration.  But if you're grazing away where the birds are coming back to your land, you know you're  
**[0:32:00-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:32:00):**  grazing in a way that's good.  Birds are like the most objective judge.  I'd say all life really.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:32:10):**  You know, if you want to know what pastures regenerative, go out there and see how many  grasshoppers, dragonflies, butterflies and birds.  Biodiversity.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:32:20):**  Biodiversity is your best index.  I think birds are really handy for us humans because they're big enough to see.  And you know, we appreciate looking at them.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:32:31):**  So I mean, that's really the thing we're shooting for here is trying to, you know, the entrepreneur  in me is always thinking, how do we take this thing that's really complicated?  And I'll sit down and talk science with folks any day.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:32:48):**  But what I really need is American consumers because they really are the missing link.  I don't know what you guys think, but I think on the supply side, just, you know, this was  coming up on, it was almost exactly eight years ago when I stumbled into this space.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:33:06):**  I think the regenerative producer side continues to grow strongly.  And but what we need is, you know, what we call more thoughtful leaders, people who give  a damn, people who think about where their food comes from.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:33:25):**  Organic was kind of a, you know, it was a really important intermediate trend.  It was about farming in a way that, well, people thought it was doing less bad for the  environment and it might have been, but you know, what they're really buying is something  
**[0:33:38-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:33:38):**  that didn't have toxins in it for them.  Right.  But, you know, the dirty little secret of farmers, of course, is that some organic industrial  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:33:48):**  organic operations can be just as disastrous.  It's really bad.  Yeah, it could be really bad.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:33:54):**  Right.  And then we can start talking about soil erosion.  Well, it's, you know, they have a lot of rules.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:00):**  And so if they only listen to the rules and everything else, they do whatever they want.  Yeah, back to the bird thing.  I think if you if you do this in a way where the birds are coming back, it means you're  
**[0:34:11-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:11):**  doing good things.  And I think one of the first regenerative ranches I was on a part of their land, they  had just taken up from a prior organic farm.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:24):**  And you know, it was basically sterile.  It was tilled more than the non-organic stuff because the tillage was the alternative to  chemicals.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:31):**  Yeah.  And, you know, regenerative, I mean, everybody has their own definition.  When I get into the science, I can get really technical on some of that definition.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:41):**  But I think to me, regenerative agriculture is growing food and fiber in a way that allows  the land to catch more sunshine tomorrow than it did yesterday.  And if we kind of adopt that mindset, whereas, you know, the production system where every  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:34:56):**  acre is trying to figure out, well, it's not just tomorrow because I can go out and I can  cheat tomorrow, but I can't cheat next year.  Right.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:35:05):**  You've got to think longer term time cycles.  If we're farming and producing food in a way that's increasing the capacity of an acre  to grow more and better food, we're heading in the right direction and the birds are going  
**[0:35:17-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:35:17):**  to come back.  I can just tell you that the thing that's really fascinating about birds is they're  incredibly responsive to habitat changes.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:35:25):**  And in the case of pastures, grassland birds are incredibly specific.  In fact, when we started the carbon sinking project when I was still in Shell, we called  it Project Metalark because I was from Nebraska and the state bird was Metalark.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:35:40):**  I wasn't really much deeper than that.  And simply because as I was trying to decide what the name of the project, I learned that  metal arcs like to build their nests in small indentations in pastures like the hoof prints  
**[0:35:53-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:35:53):**  of cattle.  And they also like to have varying topography, varying mosaic, a tapestry of different grass  heights.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:36:03):**  If you have a pasture that's kind of mowed to the ground, you might have some killed  deer running around or some of these birds that like the shallow grass, but different  birds like different kinds of situations.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:36:15):**  Max Alliger in Missouri gave a talk early on in my journey and just helped me see that  birds are very responsive to habitat changes.  I think that's really what happened when you've got these pulsing, you know, episodic grazing  
**[0:36:28-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:36:28):**  things moving around from paddock to paddock, right, which you've got this constantly evolving  tapestry of ecosystems on your land.  And that creates all kinds of different habitats for birds.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:36:38):**  I mean, there's just so many farmers that are inspiring here now.  In a couple of weeks, a farmer in Iowa by the name of Phil Spectus, who has a particular  passion for birds, is holding a field day that I'm hoping to make it up to.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:36:58):**  What day is that?  Max You're having an interesting Phil Spect.  Max What day?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:37:02):**  Max May 8th.  Max May 8th.  Well, that's going to be right now I have you scheduled for release on the 10th.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:37:09):**  Max Okay.  People will watch it on Facebook after that.  Do look at Phil, because just having a little bit of Facebook conversation with Phil a couple  
**[0:37:21-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:37:21):**  weeks ago on, you know, what is the optimum relationship between grazing animals and bird  habitat and it are, you know, there, there's some interactions and they're probably seasonal.  You know, what you're doing during breeding season when the in his case, the bottling  
**[0:37:37-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:37:37):**  show up on his farm, which is why he's holding it on May 8th, kind of right about that time.  And, you know, but but how do you graze and I, again, meaning go to conferences, you can  watch YouTube videos, but I think you'll learn a lot by watching the animals and how they're  
**[0:37:55-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:37:55):**  interacting with your landscape as well.  And birds are just incredibly adaptive and, and look, grassland birds.  We've lost about 53% in the last 50 years, I like to remind people that Rachel Carson  
**[0:38:09-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:38:09):**  we're talking, so we're recording this on Earth Day and Rachel Carson is famous for  inspiring the first Earth Day by Silent Spring, the book, right?  Getting people to realize the hazards of DDT.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:38:23):**  Well, you know, so we got rid of DDT, but, you know, we came up with other chemicals.  We just went to something that was slightly less bad.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:38:32):**  And the real problem, DDT to me was as much a symptom as a cause, right?  It's the linear industrial mindset that says I'm going to manage, control, conquer the  natural system instead of working with it.  
**[0:38:46-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:38:46):**  And so I think, you know, when I, I can say, hey, we've lost 50% of grassland bird populations  in North America after the first Earth Day started after Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring.  We may not have solved that problem.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:01):**  Right?  And then you get some species like Bobolinks are down about 61% in the last 50 years.  So they're a little bit worse than average for other grassland birds.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:10):**  So and yet we see that when we change grazing management strategies, the birds come back  pretty quickly.  Brian, I don't know what your story is on biodiversity beyond.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:22):**  Lesser prairie chickens and kit foxes.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:27):**  So that's, that's, that's where we got, that's, that's what I've seen is, is lessers and enough  lessers that they're either it was either a swift fox or a kit fox.  I mean, there's no way to tell unless you take one apart, you know, get your hands on  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:41):**  it and take it apart.  And we're right on the line for habitat for both.  So it could have been either.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:47):**  But you know, what's that kind of fox eat?  Well, it likes to eat a lot of grassland birds.  You know?  
**[0:39:54-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:39:54):**  Okay, so yeah, we're talking about birds and bird friendly habitat and hearing and bragging  about having foxes.  Well, that is something to brag about because that means that there's a healthy enough bird  
**[0:40:02-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:02):**  population to support predators.  And you know, so the birds kind of come and go.  I mean, lessers, they move Lex around all the time.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:17):**  I may not have them today.  I may have them next week, then they may leave.  That's okay.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:24):**  I'm just going to keep maintaining the habitat and doing the best job I can.  If you build it, they will come.  That's what's happened with beavers.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:31):**  Yeah, I think that's right.  And then the beavers build habitat to the beavers build habitat for other species that  come in and help help habitat.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:41):**  That's exactly right.  So I mean, we're still early in this journey.  But I think animals and habitat is one possible pathway where consumers can feel like they're  
**[0:40:51-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:40:51):**  participating in doing something good, right?  You know, there's been things, you know, other efforts to connect biodiversity and habitat  to consumer products.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:41:02):**  Now, I think it's hard to maintain the integrity of those things.  It's one of the things I really, really respect.  I think National Audubon Society has created a really good protocol.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:41:15):**  It's practical and understandable.  It's not based on a bunch of rules that you can meet the letter but fail the intent.  And importantly, you know, there's a couple of there's some really important dimensions for farmers that it's entirely it's not a pay to play type thing for the producers, right.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:41:35):**  So the Audubon Society pays full burden of cost of managing the system they work with  every farm has to have a for purpose written habitat management plan.  You identify the species that are associated with your particular habitat that you know,  
**[0:41:54-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:41:54):**  you can graze a little bit differently to keep an eye on.  And then there's, you know, other things on environmental sustainability and general grazing, you know, pasture based protocols and things like that.  But they're kept pretty simple and understandable.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:42:09):**  And, you know, hopefully, you know, practical and useful for farmers and meaningful to consumers.  And it's certainly why we chose to go that way.  You know, there may be multiple ways to there will be multiple ways to do this kind of stuff in time.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:42:30):**  But kind of this focus on biodiversity, using the face of bird on the bigger story of regeneration was our choice.  So if somebody wants to get a hold of some bubble links, or if they're interested in blueness, what where can we go for that?  Just go to bluenessbeef.com.  
**[0:42:48-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:42:48):**  Okay, great.  Now, the million dollar question is, if a producer is out there that wants to get involved with Autobahn and be certified bird friendly, where do you start?  Probably the best place to start, frankly, is directly with the National Autobahn Society folks, because the first step is to get certified, you have to be certified to be eligible.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:43:13):**  And then having quality genetics and performance on those genetics becomes important if you want to sell your product through blueness, but you don't have to sell your product through blueness.  We're one of many market partners with the National Autobahn Society.  And, you know, even if you're not selling a fully finished animal product, I mean, there's it's not just for finished animals, right?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:43:37):**  I mean, you can have your farm and ranch certified just as a producer.  But yeah, every state has a designated coordinator.  So here, Texas, Oklahoma is Thomas Schrader.  
**[0:43:49-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:43:49):**  He's based in Austin at Schroeder.  Sorry, I mispronounced the German pronunciation sometimes.  But every state, you know, has a coordinator.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:44:04):**  But you can go to Autobahn.org slash ranching and find out more about the protocols and how to locate the ranching coordinator in your state.  I think the current number is actually only 13 states.  It's basically Montana and the Dakotas down into Texas.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:44:27):**  The easternmost state for the moment is Missouri, but I think with support from a recent USDA grant, the program is going to be expanding into two or three more states here fairly soon.  I do hope that one day in the not too distant future, Autobahn will be certifying ranchers in all states.  But because it's of it, it takes quite a time and resource commitment from Autobahn, it's not something you can just sign up for everywhere.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:44:57):**  They have to have staff that can work the program.  And so they've started where the grassland birds are most important.  And that's the former prairies and Great Plains of North America.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:45:07):**  Right. So. Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas.  Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, New Mexico are definitely they've got California in there now, Nevada.  I think there's a real effort to step it up in California lately, a lot of interest from multiple directions.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:45:37):**  Can't recall some of the other boundaries were were currently at Blue Nest.  There's about three and a half million acres now in the Autobahn program where we've purchased beef from land,  constituting about 200,000 of those acres. So there's way more acres outside of our supply chain.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:45:55):**  We feel really good about what we're doing, but. We've got 650 million acres of pasture land in the United States.  There's a long, long way to go yet to help move that along.  And what we hope to do with the blueness thing is if we can get consumers engaged in this story to pay a premium price for a premium product that is truly premium,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:46:18):**  then we can pay the ranchers more. Right. And that's how we're going to get more acres in this program,  not because we guilt a bunch of ranchers into doing something or regulate a bunch of ranchers into doing something.  No, I you know, we show up at the farm gate with a bigger check for a higher quality product that is genuinely higher quality.  
**[0:46:38-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:46:38):**  And it's also doing good things for the world because that's a part of our brand and what we're doing.  So, yeah, I mean, it's our foray into the space to try to make a difference here with what I call better beef with a bigger purpose.  I think it's well thought out and genius, honestly, Russ, I think. Like I said, they taste great.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:47:02):**  Yeah. Yeah. That's where we started, you know, even with our frozen beef business.  And this was Todd's genius, frankly, and I only came to appreciate it after time here was, you know,  it's not only high quality forage in the pasture that's built on high quality soil that's getting healthier.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:47:22):**  It's how you process every step of the way. It's how you you know, we have a proprietary wet aging process that Todd developed over the years.  That I think really adds a lot to the beef itself as well.  But if you want to compete in the marketplace and be, you know,  
**[0:47:41-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:47:41):**  the truly delightful steak that people want to go for and pay the premium price for, you got to do the whole thing right.  Yes. It's not as simple as just saying I put my cows behind the fence.  And especially if it's premium product, you're going to have a certain consumer that's buying that and they want those things.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:47:59):**  Yeah. And I think, you know, over time, like I said, I hope that we can scale this up and build all the business systems and production systems that help us reach what I call feedlot parity.  But, you know, let's start with what we can do. You know, HDTV started out as a luxury item and now they're much more common.  Electric cars are now on course to kind of take over the market.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:48:30):**  And they started as a fancy toy for movie stars, venture capitalists and fighter pilots.  Right. And now, you know, I routinely see electric vehicles on the streets of Houston here where I live.  So I don't see them a whole lot.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:48:46):**  No, but you, during Grassbed Exchange in California, Brian got to rent a Tesla.  I rented a Tesla. I rented a Model 3.  I remember that.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:48:58):**  So you had access.  Oh, it's phenomenal car.  Exactly.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:49:03):**  I'm just waiting for somebody to build a truck that will replace my diesel work truck and can do the work that my diesel work truck does all day.  I mean, haul bales, feed cows, go through the pasture, haul calves to town, haul feed home.  You know, it's got to do it.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:49:22):**  I haven't seen one yet.  It'll come, but I wouldn't wait.  It would be low on the list.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:49:28):**  It'll come last.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The actual truck that would do some real work and benefit real people is going to be built last because they're going to build the shiny thing that everybody's going to want to buy first.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:49:37):**  The shiny thing for the suburban thing.  And actually, I mean, of course, Elon Musk gets all the attention with that thing that looks like a stealth fighter.  But, you know, other people are doing interesting things.  
**[0:49:49-0:50:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:49:49):**  What I think will come before the farm truck is the recreational outdoors truck.  Right. The four wheel off road weekender type truck company called Rivian that I'm pretty intrigued with is doing some really creative things with their electric truck.  So all these things are, you know, entrepreneurs solving problems.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:50:09):**  Right. How do they're all great examples.  How do I take something and package it and produce it and sell it in a way that works in the market to get that product out there and real and not static.  Right. I mean, I wish our beef were cheaper today, but it's not.  
**[0:50:30-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:50:30):**  And I'm going to start with the high quality premium stuff as I work my way there.  And I'm going to work with thoughtful leaders, you know, and sometimes you find those in strange and unusual places.  One of the things I've learned here in the Blue Nest journey is honestly, I'd rather work with a thoughtful flexitarian who cares about their food than someone who just wants a cheap hamburger.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:51:00):**  Yeah, because I can I can have a conversation with someone who's being thoughtful, someone who just says, heck with it, you know, I'll take cheap at any price.  The cheapest option. Yeah.  Yeah. And, you know, I hope that someday it's the cheapest option.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:51:15):**  And exactly energetically, it can be we've we've done some modeling that suggests that there's a real there's a real opportunity to go there.  That's not where we're at today.  So right. I'm glad you bring that up, though, because that's something that I think about all the time is you think about low income communities and how they purchase their beef or even just meats in general.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:51:36):**  And they buy the cheap stuff that probably isn't good for them.  And we talk about people who the reason that they get into regenerative is because they had health issues like either a thyroid condition or some kind of gastric issue.  And they found out when they are on more of a holistic diet and eating regenerative beef that has solved that for them.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:51:58):**  And I'm like, wow, how do we how do we get this to these people who cannot afford to do that?  Because I almost think of it as like an elitist way to eat, which I know that's not true.  Yeah, but but like my family, you know, they would they were when they see what I pay for my my beef.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:52:16):**  They're like, you're crazy.  Like if they really if I told them.  Yeah, but I would tell people, you know, it's a classic pay me now or pay me later.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:52:24):**  Exactly. So that's what I say.  I said I'm I'm in this for the long run.  Yeah, yeah. I was one of those quasi sickly kids.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:52:33):**  I knew my Walgreens pharmacist by name when I was five years old.  And but I'm proud to say I haven't taken a prescription drug in more than 10 years now.  Well, and there's nothing but regenerative meat in my freezer.  
**[0:52:50-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:52:50):**  My question marks in this house are the broccoli and Brussels sprouts, you know, and I don't eat any of that processed carb crap either.  Right. You know, yeah. Honestly, if I could get people eating meat first and get them off that processed carbs first,  you know, then we can start fixing diabetes and then we can move them on to the better.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:53:15):**  And I, you know, I'm sure you all are familiar with the work of Fred Provenza.  You know, a lot of people in the grass fed meat, you know, early on, they get caught up in omega threes and then it's conjugated linoleic acids.  And, you know, I personally think the evidence is even more important on some of the fat soluble vitamins.  
**[0:53:38-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:53:38):**  But Fred, I think what he's really doing for us is helping us appreciate that what we eat is a whole lot more than a few ingredients we can put on a label.  Yeah, there's just so much in there that, you know, you know, maybe by the time our grandkids are phytochemicals and terpenes and nano compounds that we don't even have names for.  Oh, I know. Right. Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:54:03):**  And so how does how does this all play together in a system where even in our diet, I mean, I try to modulate our own diet, you know, eat more fruits in the summer and fall because they're seasonal and, you know,  Yes, eating seasonal. Right.  That's something that I don't do.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:54:22):**  Yeah, it's a part of the system.  Yeah.  All right.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:54:26):**  I mean, I just think we have so much to learn.  But back to your thing, CK, right?  How do we how do we build a system?  
**[0:54:34-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:54:34):**  You mean I shouldn't be eating strawberries in December?  No, no, it's potatoes, right?  Maybe Thanksgiving is still OK.

Those strawberries in December there because we've got this industrial global economy that brings them in from strange places and so on.  And, you know, I get only, you know, it's not just me.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:03):**  I feel good about my honey.  You know, we don't use sugar.  We use honey in this house for anything.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:09):**  And I'm sure you guys know Jonathan Cobb, one of my fellow grasses.  I love him.  Yeah, he has a honey farmer that has some hives on his farm, but their their main outlet is up there in the same town where Jonathan is.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:25):**  And I buy all my honey from him.  And he oh, my God.  It's just like I think honey is toxic in the grocery store.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:32):**  I wouldn't buy honey from a grocery store.  I like local honey for my allergies, actually because I'm new to Kansas.  And so it's like, you know, I have to I have to do it.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:41):**  It became a part of our COVID protocol.  You know, we generally eat healthy, but as we're trying to make sure that we stayed uber healthy with the COVID thing.  And so far it's worked.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:55:55):**  Yeah, that and elderberry syrup.  Am I being weird?  But I love the elderberry syrup.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:56:01):**  There's some basis for the elderberry syrup stuff.  But, you know, we doubled up on our grass fed liver rations and we started taking a spoonful of extra honey a couple of times a week, a raw honey.  And that's my breakfast, two spoonfuls of honey.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:56:18):**  Well, it's good.  I mean, there's whole civilizations that, you know, based on that stuff, what they didn't do is lace it with.  You know, high fructose corn syrup and other artificial things.  
**[0:56:31-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:56:31):**  Again, I wouldn't unless I had a spectrometer, I wouldn't buy honey from a grocery store these days because I don't know that it's really honey anymore.  And, you know, there's been exposés, you know, not not counting the.  Highly dramatized, you know, documentary trend that we're in, but somebody went in and did some genetic testing on the seafood counter and some major grocery chains and found out that everything that was labeled what it said wasn't really what it said.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:57:05):**  You know that there's there's just our economy creates a lot of incentives for for fraud and for cheap.  And it feels good right up until it doesn't like in our space this year.  Right. Regenerative the world. At least for a few moments became visible to people that this very highly concentrated meat production system and processing system may have some problems.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:57:29):**  Right. So right now, last spring, when suddenly the packing plants were the first outbreaks and had to shut down and kill animals.  For some people, that was a wake up call. Right.  It's like now a lot of people gone back to normal, but I think more people have found their way into regenerative food and putting healthier food on their families tables.  
**[0:57:52-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:57:52):**  And I think that gives us something to build on as an industry.  And, you know, we just got a long, long way to go.  I you know, it's the classical Chinese proverb, you know, a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step type thing.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:58:07):**  And I think we're still in the early steps of the. The full industry, like I said, hats off to the producers, the pioneering producers have have led the way they've got it started.  I think, you know, at a principal level, getting this stuff figured out.  Right. And then, you know, we certainly have way, way, way more non regenerative producers.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:58:30):**  So there's there's more degenerative acres on this earth than there are regenerative.  But we're growing. The regenerative community pretty good at the moment.  What we need to do is grow the regenerative. The rest of that supply chain, including all the way to the consumers.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:58:50):**  Right. We've got to get the consumers engaged in this story, build the bridge between the producers and the consumers.  And I think you're doing a good I think you're doing a great thing with blueness and the and the bubble links.  And one thing I like to ask on the podcast is. What can everybody do to to move the lever, keep moving the lever?  
**[0:59:12-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:59:12):**  But I think we've kind of already covered that unless there's something else that, you know, to choose better beef, choose better meat, choose better food.  Right. Yeah. Consumers don't realize. In fact, there's been a lot of people trying to discourage consumers.  Oh, no, you can't make a difference. You know, only the policymakers in Washington can make a difference.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:59:31):**  Well, policy is important, but in my experience, policy follows it. The consumers wake up.  And start choosing better beef. And I even tell people, even in the age of blueness, you know, find a local farmer, you know, find somebody you can trust.  You know, start there. Come to us if you don't find a solution there, because, you know, we you know, our ideal customer is that urban consumer in New York, Miami, Los Angeles.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=0:59:57):**  They're nowhere near. They don't have the time. And that's where a lot of the population is.  We want to be that solution that makes the right thing the easy thing.  But man, if you can if you can find a truly regenerative farm in your neighborhood, you need to just go buy direct.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:00:12):**  And that's true for your eggs and and for your meat and your milk, whatever else you can get as much as you can.  Now, it's not as easy as just going to the farmer's market, in my experience.  And indeed, you see quite a bit of variation in quality.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:00:29):**  So you've got to find the optimum that works for you.  But I think there's way more choices for people today to find that stuff.  It was literally when I came back from I mentioned, you know, my own journey started when I saw Alan Savory talk at TED.  
**[1:00:49-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:00:49):**  And then I my new friend, Peter Bic, enticed me to come to the first Savory conference in 2013 and then the first Grassfed Exchange in 2013.  And I came home from those realizing because I had already kind of stumbled in from the health perspective, this whole grass fed beef thing.  But I came home going, oh, man, it's just not as simple as buying grass fed at the farmer's market or the grocery store.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:01:15):**  No, it's not. Yeah, not right. So most people don't understand that.  And at the time, I had to go away and do my own research to try to find a space.  It wasn't until I met Jonathan Cobb and Kaitlyn Cobb at the Grassfed Exchange that I finally found my lifelong producer until we have Luna.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:01:34):**  Jonathan's only doing lamb now, but we still get our lamb from Kaitlyn.  And oh, my God, I think America would be reinvented if you could taste pastured lamb.  I think it's an untapped market.  
**[1:01:49-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:01:49):**  Yeah, my my mother in law, I just picked up lamb when I was in Boise with her and we made some chops on the grill.  And I was like, oh, it's just so good.  Like, I don't understand why people do not love this.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:02:00):**  Like when it's done right.  That's the difference. Because feedlot lamb is not good.  It's got to know it's got to taste greasy wool.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:02:08):**  Yeah, it's greasy.  I tell people you need a lot of garlic with lamb, whereas feedlot beef is just bland.  Well, exactly. It tastes like corn.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:02:20):**  You could just flavor it how you like.  You do. And now feedlot beef is bland because.  That animal is not eating a variety of phytochemicals and turpenters.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:02:31):**  That's exactly right.  They're getting energy and roughage and trying to keep them alive as long as they can until they get their kill slot.  Yeah, like. Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:02:43-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:02:43):**  You know, and whereas we're talking about the regenerative grass fed type system, you know, those animals are out there and they're grazing different plants every day and they're getting those different nano nano compounds and phytochemicals.  And and there's that bacteria and microbiome exchange between animals and between the grass and between the soil that is totally absent in the feedlot.  That's exactly right. Yeah. And again, it's a part of that mystery and magic.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:03:13):**  You know, it's knowable, but it's not known.  I mean, again, I think with science, the stuff that Fred's doing with this Dr. Steven Van Vliet at Duke that you guys may have seen a little bit on where they're getting in and profiling some of the true.  Complexity of the chemical complexity of biochemical complexity of the food.  
**[1:03:34-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:03:34):**  And it's just I mean, it's almost laughable that we try to describe food with a couple of protein, carb, fat and a couple of key things and think that we've got the whole picture.  Right. So and, you know, Fred, you know what he learned by all his observational research work in with sheep and goats,  mostly, as I'm sure you guys know, was that, you know, you know, they're not distracted by what they read in The New York Times as to what's supposed to be healthy for them.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:04:06):**  They've got this really finely tuned because it's evolved mechanism between flavor and health that they can connect the dots and eat what's good for them, eat what they need when they need it.  Right. It's like ability to self-medicate is just mind blowing right with animals.  And, you know, I think there's every reason to believe we still have it, too.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:04:32):**  It's just that we've let our intellect get in the way of good food.  I again, before I discovered regenerative stuff and I just started to discover, you know, whole food again.  I mean, I grew up in the age of Tang and spam and crap macaroni and cheese and all this stuff.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:04:48):**  I thought that was food.  Right. I know it was processed crap.  And but once I started eating real food again, it's like, oh, my God, my body knew how to recognize it again.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:04:59):**  You take away the sugar, you take all the way the synthetic.  Things that are meant to trick your taste buds and and you really your body goes, oh, that's what healthy feels.  Yeah, right. Like this is what it feels like to have energy in the morning.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:05:16):**  Exactly. Oh, I even up until I discovered whole food, the only difference in my life was that around age 30,  I went from drinking full on Mountain Dew to drinking, drinking Diet Mountain Dew.  But I was if you would have caught me at work in the business, I was never a coffee guy.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:05:33):**  Man, I would I'd be pounding those things down all day long.  It was like energy drinks before energy drinks. Right. Brian, I remember him.  I was a consumer of Diet Mountain Dew in mass quantities. I've never drank regular soda.  
**[1:05:49-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:05:49):**  I've never liked the taste. Oh, really? Yeah. Like the the the scum that leaves on your teeth.  So I've always drank diet soda. But I'm proud to say I haven't had soda in two weeks.  Well, I'm not doing so good on the sugar. I had cookies last night, so don't judge me.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:06:05):**  But anything there, it's I can't think that I've had a soda in 10 years now.  And I don't really you're better than us. I love Dr. Pepper. I don't. I just love Dr. Pepper.  Yeah. Dr. Pepper was the other thing that, you know, it's a big deal.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:06:21):**  I limit myself to one a day. Like if I have soda, just one.  What I might be a big one, like 32, but just one here.  I drink tea all day long. I have my tea. Camomile tea is my go to.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:06:36):**  And that's my bedtime tea. But yeah, I have my little array in the pantry.  And so tea is awesome. But I just make tea all day and I enjoy it.  I think once you eliminate all that synthetic stuff in your diet, you're as an intellectual,  
**[1:06:51-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:06:51):**  I'm just I overthink things. It's just kind of who I am. That's OK.  Same thing. You're in good company. Yeah.  From an intellectual perspective, I can just say, OK, I'm just not going to eat any of the crap stuff.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:07:04):**  So whatever I'm going to eat is going to be the good stuff. And then I'm going to let my body tell me what I want.  I'm probably not as good at listening to my body as somebody who's really good at it.  But I find that it's much, much, much easier once you kind of eliminate the crap to find your way to the good stuff and find your way to health.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:07:23):**  So it's we have to relearn how to eat. Our bodies have to relearn what food is.  Yeah, it's kind of by unlearning what we thought we knew.  Right. And that that that's that's tough for a lot of people.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:07:39):**  And once you do it, you know, there's no going back.  Right. It's really hard. Now, I can't say the same thing, by the way, that just so you don't think I'm some sort of saint.  Had had some ice cream the other week. Right. So, yeah, yeah, no, it's just nothing.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:07:58):**  Everything in moderation, even moderation, everything in moderation, variation.  If you take away my moose tracks, we're going to riot.  You try to take away my moose tracks and we're going to scrap my butt.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:08:14):**  Promise you that. Yeah.  No. So this and this is one of the things I like about the regenerative movement as a whole is it's it's got a visionary element to it, but it's a pragmat.  It's got a pragmatic element to it. Right. It's not like you don't get to be holier and now because you follow some set of rule books,  
**[1:08:33-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:08:33):**  you get better because you try to observe and watch and interact with your land and interact with your body and all these other things.  So the goal is not some false sense of perfection.  It's progress. It's a journey.  
**[1:08:52-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:08:52):**  Soil health is not a destination. It is a journey. Yeah.  Like I said, you know, even with the carbon stuff, I do worry that we think it's a destination.  We think it's so health is all about stock and it's carbon.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:09:02):**  We're going to put it in a number and we're going to get paid for it.  And I would love to find viable, sustainable, legitimate, authentic ways that farmers can earn extra revenue for the genuinely good services they're providing for the world.  Earth habitat or carbon or water infiltration. But I think I worry, like a lot of people that done poorly, it opens up doorways for crooks and corruption and other things like that.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:09:27):**  So it's an area where we all have to walk tenderly together and learn on how this stuff's going to work.  But I couldn't be more convinced. You know, back to that thing I mentioned that I've mentioned before about in order to see the kind of the big picture,  you kind of zoom all the way out to the edge of the atmosphere.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:09:53):**  Once you've seen that regenerative agriculture is as certain to be true as an apple falling from a tree.  It's like gravity. It's anchored in the first principles about how the planet works.  If you understand it right, it is inevitable. It is inevitable in some way.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:10:14):**  In fact, you know, a broader way to say it would be if we don't figure out how to participate in nature's ecosystems that make this planet healthier,  nature will select us out of the system. Yes. Yes.  Just like it has every other species. Now, it may not happen to you or me or even our grandchildren,  
**[1:10:33-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:10:33):**  but it will happen because that's that is the fundamental force that's driving the system is, again,  how to increase the planet's ability to capture the incoming solar energy.  And we our choice, in my view, is we either help it happen or we go away in time one way or another by some path.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:10:55):**  And we were replaced by artificial robots that are solar powered that do it better than we could.  I don't know, but somebody's still got a mind, all the things to build the robot and somebody's got to build the robot.  The robots can build the minds and the robots and so on.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:11:12):**  But at the end of the day, what I tell you is the energy is an energy guy.  The energy is only coming from one of two places, the sunshine that's coming in or the mass that's already here.  And the mass that's already here gets pretty complicated.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:11:26):**  It's kind of handy to have the mass part of the energy thing, which means nuclear billions of miles away from us.  And all we get is the radiation that comes from that.  Right. But not the bad, right? Not all the bad radiation.  
**[1:11:42-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:11:42):**  But not the bad radiation. Right. And the Earth is evolved in a way, right, that it has even the atmospheric constituency that moderates that for life on Earth.  So, you know, in my view, our choice as a civilization in time is how to shift from an economy that's been driven primarily based on stored sunshine from millions of years ago  to an economy that works in harmony with concurrent sunshine that is flowing in every day.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:12:15):**  And that's really what's going on with regenerative agriculture and why I say, you know,  when farmers figure out how they can capture a little bit more of that incoming sunshine next year than last year,  then we know we're going to be taking the planet in the right direction.  
**[1:12:33-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:12:33):**  So I realize that it's kind of abstract for people, but like I said, to me, it's as obvious as an apple falling from a tree.  It's anchored in first principles of physics. And I think the farmers are the engineers and operators that are making that happen on landscapes.  And the rest of us are just here to make the rest of the system work.  
**[1:12:53-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:12:53):**  The farmers are the ones that really are in the position to drive the bus.  That's great. So I want to shift gears and let's talk a little bit about let's talk a little bit about grass fed exchange.  What you got planned for GFX 2021.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:13:09):**  Well, 2021, we're still all virtual. There was a point where we'd hoped to pull off the physical conference again this year, but we gave up on that last fall.  The next physical conference will be May 18th to the 20th of 2022.  So every year from now and we will be back in Fort Worth, Texas at the place we're supposed to be.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:13:29):**  I'm so excited. Yeah. It's the Will Rogers Coliseum, which is, you know, the iconic home of the Fort Worth Livestock Show and Radio.  You know, of course, Fort Worth is one of the original cow towns.  And it's just so exciting to be there where we can get together.  
**[1:13:47-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:13:47):**  It's kind of in the center of the country where people can come from anywhere, drive, fly.  They even have a train that goes from the airport right to the hotel.  Yeah, it's so close. Yeah, it's really convenient now that so we're very excited.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:14:02):**  We just decided our theme for the conference here a couple of weeks ago, rooted in wisdom.  Oh, I love that. And so we're very excited to we're now starting to build that agenda speakers that will allow us to explore what's relevant in that topic.  We've already got farm tours set up that pretty much remain in place from what we the last time.  
**[1:14:30-1:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:14:30):**  Yeah. And had to put it all on hold.  So, yeah, but it's it's a it's a venue that's pretty unique.  It's going to allow us the biggest we've ever been able to do a grass-fed exchange and keep the sense of community.  
**[1:14:47-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:14:47):**  You know, we don't want to do a conference where you sit in an auditorium and look at the back of the head of someone in front of you.  Yeah. And we want to do a conference where people can look at each other, talk to each other, learn from each other.  And the Will Rogers Coliseum gives us a venue where we can have enough space to have about 700 people in the main hall,  
**[1:15:08-1:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:15:08):**  which is like in Santa Rosa, we had about 500 was the most we could fit.  And that was pretty tight. And but, you know, we'll have livestock exhibitions.  We got a really big exhibit hall where we're trying to cook up some ideas for different kinds of demonstrations we're going to do.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:15:24):**  We're going to have a live butchery demonstration to help farmers see how they can.  I love that field dressing. Do some things with differently with butchery to meet consumer needs.  So, you know, all pretty darned excited. And meanwhile, you know, we're kind of doing some interim things.  
**[1:15:43-1:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:15:43):**  We like many people, we decided that the thing we missed about the conference, honestly, wasn't the PowerPoint presentations.  It was the opportunity to just have conversations with folks in the hallway.  So we started here in the fall with a series we call the hallway conversations.  
**[1:16:02-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:16:02):**  And no scripts, no PowerPoints, just a couple of people getting together, hosting a Zoom call like we're doing now.  And then having other people chime in and ask questions via chat and talk for about an hour and then get back to work.  So that was almost our original concept for this.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:16:22):**  It kind of was. And then we just got to the point where CK and I were like, let's just do a podcast.  I was like, do we do office hours? Like, do we just, you know, like, but that sounded like to like back in college type deal.  And they were like podcasts. Let's just do a podcast.  
**[1:16:40-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:16:40):**  And so that was a little bit easier to do live. But in the age of Zoom, it's easier. I mean, fire up Zoom, you put it over to Facebook Live.  And if people want to watch on Facebook, they can. And then it's automatically recorded for people to come back and watch later on Facebook.  Yes. But, you know, it helps keep the community engaged, talking about real things that, you know, to me, the Grass Fed Exchange is,  
**[1:17:09-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:17:09):**  officially, it's an educational foundation, but it's not an educational foundation that has a textbook that's trying to teach you something that somebody documented.  We're trying to bring in thought leaders that are doing interesting things, whether it's the practice of production or processing or marketing or science or whatever.  You know, let's talk about whatever's, you know, hot and relevant today.  
**[1:17:33-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:17:33):**  So it's been fun. And I think, you know, we'll keep doing that and hopefully I'll build a little bit of an onramp so that when we do get together in person next May again,  you know, we will have continued to build that community and keep it keep it going and so on.  After a year of COVID lockdown and conference season being canceled last year, canceled this year, you'll sell out quick. I'll be there.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:18:06):**  I think so.  You're going to maybe I'll have to maybe you'll save me a ticket.  In fact, for what it's worth, I should have mentioned that one of the things that was designed in from 2020 that we absolutely intend to retain, we haven't yet confirmed the details.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:18:22):**  But instead of having a banquet speaker like we typically have at the Grassfield Exchange, we decided to have a regeneration festival.  And at this regeneration festival, we've got a old country folk band set up to play fun music and do a little square dancing and have some technical  for you and you can't get Willie Nelson. Yeah. That'd be pretty awesome. Right. Because he has a regenerative place. So guys, you know, I ping him for you guys.  
**[1:18:52-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:18:52):**  Is he a pasture map customer? We're trying to get him on. So, Willie, if you hear this. Yeah. If you feel free, if you need somebody to come, come consult and help him set up and learn how to use it.  CK and I can, you know, we'd be happy to come out and do onsite consulting, right?  Yep. And then we'll get him on Grassfield Exchange. He'll love it.  
**[1:19:13-1:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:19:13):**  Oh, it's just it's awesome. I mean, as you guys know, the Grassfield Exchange community is so awesome.  It's made up of giving, caring people from all around the country and all around the world now, really.  And it's just so awesome to watch young people that are getting started or old people that want to change,  
**[1:19:32-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:19:32):**  be able to talk and just compare notes with people that might be iconic people in one way or another and just, you know, learn.  And, you know, even the sense of humility in the community where it's not at all uncommon to talk to people, even have people talking on the main stage.  I tried this and it didn't work. It went badly. You know, we you know, it's a warts and all type community.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:20:00):**  And that's why it's such a wonderful learning community that that, you know, it's just honest people trying to do better,  not, you know, sell you a bag of goods of some kind. So.  It's awesome. So, yeah, we're excited. We'll keep the hallway conversation thing going.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:20:17):**  But yeah, I'm glad to think I'm glad to hear you think we'll sell out quickly because I think so, too.  And it's also huge. Like I remember when Pestermep was involved in the California one because we were from San Francisco.  It was so much work. We we helped you with. So if you guys need support from us again, let us know.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:20:34):**  Because I don't think everyone realizes how much work it takes to pull that off.  Yeah. So true. And in Fort Worth, we've got some, you know, easier things to work with.  Just it helps to be in a big city, logistics wise, wise and so on.  
**[1:20:53-1:21:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:20:53):**  So even getting people back and forth and around to airports and things like that and food was complicated.  I remember helping get the sandwiches ready to go out on the tours.  Right. You know, you're working. We've got a we've got a caterer set up that when we sat down and started working out details with them and talked about our size,  
**[1:21:13-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:21:13):**  you know, we're we're tiny compared to what they are. Yeah, it's a destination.  Right. So not to say Sonoma is not, but I think it's a different kind of destination.  Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're going to be in really good hands overall here.  
**[1:21:28-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:21:28):**  And indeed, it's going to be a hell of a dance when we were able to pull that off and get people back together again.  So May 18th through the 20th next year. I'm looking forward to it.  I'm writing that down. May 18 to 20. Yeah.  
**[1:21:49-1:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:21:49):**  So, Russ, I really appreciate the time. Have we left anything on the table today that you need to you want to tell us about?  My brain is fried, you know, typically all the time. I mean, we're.  It is after five on a Thursday. Yeah, I wish I had some, you know, Casey case, some type thing that probably dates me or anything.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:22:15):**  You know, keep your feet on the ground, but keep reaching for the stars. I think that's kind of when I was a kid,  he was a radio deejay and he signed off every night that way every week.  And I'm old enough to know who he was. Oh, good. Good, good, good, good.  
**[1:22:32-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:22:32):**  Well, you know, I think that's where regenerative ag is at now. Right.  You know, literally keep our feet on the ground. Right. And soil is the foundation of everything.  Right. I just marvel at soil.  
**[1:22:45-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:22:45):**  It's so way more interesting than petroleum reservoirs that I grew up with.  And, you know, we think we don't know much about food, but we don't know a lot about soil, but we know some big picture things.  And we appreciate that this is the fundamental thing where, you know, all life gets connected.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:23:05):**  Here's another factoid for you to, you know, geek out with with me on 70 percent of the sunshine falls on the oceans,  but 70 percent of the sunlight gets converted on land by a photosynthesis.  And the reason that is, is because of soil. Soil is this underground ecosystem that matches nutrients with life.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:23:34):**  That helps that life grow in a way that's much, much harder to do in the ocean.  So life started in the ocean because it was easy. There was plenty of water and things to get started.  But you notice life crawled onto land and kept going.  
**[1:23:50-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:23:50):**  It didn't go the other way around when it got on land. It got way more complex.  Yeah, it got way more complex. Right. And I think I think it really is regenerative agriculture here.  You know, we're we're still doing that, but we're back to the soil.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:24:05):**  Right. That's the foundation of this stuff. We get that right.  Then, you know, everything else can flow. And we, the animals, the plants, we're all just a part of this system that makes it work.  And when we do work together, you know, you get healthy food that's really tasty and, you know, we're all super happy.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:24:26):**  And, you know, there's health. And, you know, I hope for a future where everybody can go 10 years without going to the pharmacy.  Right. And I think that starts with healthy soil and healthy producers producing healthy food.  And then other participants in an economy that can help get that healthy food to consumers.  
**[1:24:45-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:24:45):**  So, yeah, no, it's exciting times. I feel like the movement's come a long way since I started.  But I feel like we're just getting started. Right. So there's this whole regenerative ag thing is, you know,  hopefully something that keeps going and going and going for a long time. So, anyhow, pleasure talking to you.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:25:04):**  We we hope the wave of regeneration continues. And, you know, I think CK and I have been here for been here with our surfboards and paddled out.  We're just waiting and waiting for that right wave to come. And I think that I think we're there.  And that's a great place to end. It is. Russ, I really we we really appreciate your time today.  
**[1:25:26-1:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:25:26):**  Thank you for joining us. CK, anything else? No, that's been great.  I love the I love the context around why we choose to eat regeneratively.  So I think that was piece of I was missing it and how I explained to my friends.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:25:39):**  So I'm going to as soon as this publishes, I'm going to send them this podcast. But this is why you should eat differently.  Awesome. All right. CK, Brian, great talking with you again.  Thanks again, Russell. And enjoy the rest of your day. All right.  
**[1:25:54-1:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:25:54):**  That sure was a great conversation with Russ, and I've had a lot of great conversations with him over the last couple of years.  I'm really looking forward to Grass Fed Exchange in 2022. Being able to reconnect with a lot of you folks in person.  As a special bonus, Russ has given me a code for the Bobolinks we talked about during the episode.  
**[1:26:12-1:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:26:12):**  That's Bobo reboot. So B O B O reboot for I think it's 10 percent off your first order of Bobolinks from Blue Nest Beef.  So be sure to go check those out. Use the code so they know where you heard it.  And as always, guys, we'll be back next Monday with another episode of Ranching Reboot, trying to bring you guys great content on schedule.  
**[1:26:35-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/12--Russ-Conser---Blue-Nest-Beef-Biodiversity-is-Your-Best-Index-e10f6so#t=1:26:35):**  Give us a like, follow, share, subscribe, listen to us on your favorite podcast platform and make sure you tell our friends about us.  And with that, I'm out of here. Red Hills Rancher out.

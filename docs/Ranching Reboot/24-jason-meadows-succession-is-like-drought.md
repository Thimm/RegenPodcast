**[0:01:00-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:01:00):**  He's the host of the Ag State of Mind podcast.  He's joining myself and CK.  And we're going to have a little chat about his podcast and mental health and ag.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:01:09):**  So Jason, welcome to the show.  Hey guys, thanks for having me.  It's a pleasure to be here and I'm really excited to chat with you guys.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:01:17):**  Well, it's great to be here.  So what's new with you?  What's new on the Ag State of Mind podcast lately?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:01:25):**  So we're in that season where it's just kind of, there's no real...  A lot of in the past, I have really tried to go with themes and stuff, but now I'm just  kind of just whatever comes at me.  
**[0:01:47-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:01:47):**  You know, I had one of the best conversations this week with a guy by the name of Michael  DeSau, who has the Vets in Ag podcast.  Brian it's something you should really check out.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:02:03):**  He's a military veteran, he's a former Marine and he is starting like this consulting company  trying to match veterans with positions in agriculture.  And I mean, I could have talked to the guy for five hours and not gotten everything out  
**[0:02:21-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:02:21):**  there.  But it was a really, really cool conversation and just how the military can be such a great  place to learn the skills that are needed in agriculture and obviously vice versa.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:02:35):**  It was a really fascinating conversation that we got to have.  I'll have to check that out and give that a listen.  I'll make sure I put that in the show notes for anybody that listens to this one.  
**[0:02:47-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:02:47):**  And speaking from experience, there's a lot of ranch life that looking back my military  background really helps me out with.  Yeah, I'd say that's probably true.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:03:01):**  It makes sense, honestly.  Well, yeah.  Say more.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:03:05):**  What do you mean by that, Brian?  Knowing how to prioritize and then when a crisis does come up or a very stressful situation,  you know how to fall back to some training or that you've already thought through and  
**[0:03:24-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:03:24):**  you just got to go take care of it.  Those would be the big ones.  It's really come in handy with pasture burning and help coordinate and lead teams and accomplish  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:03:37):**  really big burns.  That's where a lot of it's really come in handy.  I can see that.  
**[0:03:44-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:03:44):**  So tell us a little bit about your podcast.  I mean, what do you guys normally talk about there and how did you get into podcasting?  So my favorite podcast of all time will always be the Working Cows podcast.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:04:01):**  I think that's probably where a lot of the seeds were sown for this podcast too.  I listen to Clay's podcasts so much and I never really had an idea that I would actually  have one of my own, but he had Aaron Berger on right shortly after the Nebraska floods  
**[0:04:24-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:04:24):**  of 2019.  It was just a sidebar kind of in passing.  He mentions like, yeah, we're really worried about the mental health of the people that  
**[0:04:36-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:04:36):**  are involved in the flooding.  That's really, and I told Clay for the first time a couple of weeks, a couple of months  ago, him and I had a phone call that that was kind of like, I think that's probably  
**[0:04:49-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:04:49):**  unconsciously or subconsciously, I guess that's probably where it started, where it started  turning for me.  But then we had an issue on our farm a couple of months later where there was a tractor  
**[0:05:03-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:05:03):**  fire and I was away from home.  Carrie and I were in Dallas, Carrie's my wife and we were in Dallas at a conference and  my son and my dad were putting up hay and Levi calls me, he was 14 at the time, says  
**[0:05:19-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:05:19):**  there's a tractor fire and Baylor caught fire first and then he couldn't get it put out.  I mean, stressful situation, right?  But I remember how much better I, how well I handled it and how much better I had handled  
**[0:05:36-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:05:36):**  it now that I had been working on trying to get better with anxiety, with not getting  so stressed with things.  And I realized I handled myself pretty well and said, you know, there's gotta be people  
**[0:05:50-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:05:50):**  who struggle like me and want to tell the story of how they struggled, gotten better  and get that story out to the masses.  And on that eight hour drive home from Dallas, Carrie and I kind of came, we talked, brainstormed  
**[0:06:06-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:06):**  and came and came up with it that I would start a podcast.  I had no idea what to do to start a podcast.  I'm sure you guys know.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:14):**  It's like, I mean, I've been there.  Learn it.  Learn as you go.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:20):**  And you know, I in fact reached out to Clay and gosh, he helped me out so much.  And Brian, you and I have talked about it.  He's just been so, he's like podcast godfather.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:34):**  I feel like.  And he was just so like, so gracious with his time and his knowledge and he never got  like, I mean, I'm sure like looking back now, I asked all kinds of dumb questions.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:48):**  You know, what would be dumb questions to me now?  But no, he was just so, so patient with me.  And like, if I'd have a question, he'd answer it.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:06:58):**  And then some, you know, it was just a really, he made it so easy on me.  And just now here we are, I'm almost 100 episodes in and we've chatted with folks from around  the country and the world, just all about the things, all things, mental health, but  
**[0:07:18-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:07:18):**  also just health in general in ag.  Working on the human element, so much of agriculture focus, education, podcast, whatever it is,  focuses on the production side.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:07:34):**  And that's really important.  But what we want to do is focus on the human side of it.  The managing the stress, managing your time, managing your finances, making sure that it's  
**[0:07:47-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:07:47):**  an overall wellness of the human being involved.  Because when we get down to it, it's the most important aspect, you know, if you're really  trying to get down to it.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:07:58):**  So yeah, that's what, that's, I thought I would talk more about mental illness than  I have.  You know, we talk about it plenty.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:08:09):**  But what I found out is we all deal with mental health.  It's something that we all have and we all have to face at a certain level.  And it's just understanding that it is something we all have to pay attention to and trying  
**[0:08:32-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:08:32):**  to get tools out to people and conversations out to people that are going to help us all,  no matter how we struggle or at what level.  Awesome.  
**[0:08:46-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:08:46):**  And you know, those are the conversations that are really hard to have.  Previous episode, we just had a great conversation with Dallas Mount about, you know, people  management and we got to have fun to some session onto some succession rabbit trails.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:05):**  What do you have to say about that?  I mean, I know you've had some good guests talk about succession and family dynamics.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:12):**  Whoo, that's a tough one.  Right.  And we've talked about it and I don't know if there's any real great answer.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:20):**  Or I shouldn't say great answer.  No easy answer to that.  It's a, those are hard conversations to have.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:30):**  And but you still got to have them.  Right.  No matter how.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:35):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's hard, I guess is, is like, I wish we could normalize them not being hard,  you know?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:41):**  And so do I. And you know, I'm, I'm kind of going through it on my own place now where  there's five siblings involved and my dad's in his last years.  And so it's something that I'm kind of dealing with real time.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:09:55):**  And so what if I had any advice from my own experience and from people who I've talked  to, I've talked to Mary Jo Ehrman.  I have plans to talk to Elaine, Elaine Frase out of Canada.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:10:10):**  I know Clay had her on a few months ago.  If I had any advice from and what I've learned is, put it all out there.  Don't leave anything, you know, to get to guesswork or to, to be found out later.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:10:28):**  Everybody's in a much better place, no matter what it is, you know, I could tell you from  a, from the standpoint of someone who stands to inherit some pretty significant stuff,  no matter what it is, what, how big or how little part of it I would be feel so much  
**[0:10:49-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:10:49):**  comfortable just knowing.  And just having it all out there and having everybody on the same page and having a mediator,  someone who is there a neutral third party who can kind of, like I said, mediate and  
**[0:11:05-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:11:05):**  be in the middle there and understand what's best for the entire operation.  I couldn't stress that enough.  Family mediation is, you know, that can always be beneficial because when we're dealing with  
**[0:11:20-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:11:20):**  family, we're often dealing with, you know, some deep seated emotional stuff.  Oh, and generational trauma.  And years of backstories and end jokes and, and things.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:11:33):**  And having that third party mediator there really dampens down a lot of the emotional  or can dampen a lot of the emotional reactions, the negative emotional reactions.  And you know, it, I just had the thought, you know, I say, I know two things about drought.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:11:54):**  We're either in one or we're getting ready to have one.  And succession planning is like that.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:02):**  Like we're either planning to take over something or we need to be planning on how we're going  to secure this and pass it on to somebody that will care for it.  So have you run across any good family mediation resources?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:18):**  Elaine, like I said, she's probably one of the best.  Jolene Brown is another one.  I've not had Jolene on the podcast yet.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:28):**  She's almost impossible to link up with.  Yeah.  Just because of her, the way her schedule is.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:33):**  I mean, she's good then.  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:37):**  But she, they are just so much, there's just so much there and so much, she has this saying,  oh gosh, I'll screw it up if I try to say it, but it's a line from the Corblan song.  Fair isn't always equal and equal isn't always fair.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:12:57):**  Right.  You know, and it just kind of comes as harsh as it may seem.  Sometimes you just, people are just going to be pissed and you just have to have to  
**[0:13:09-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:13:09):**  deal with it.  And as much as that sucks, I mean, we would love to make everybody happy, right?  But nothing's ever going to move forward by making everybody happy.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:13:20):**  And it's important to not have the, you don't have to have the full conversation and have  everything worked out, but you need to continue having the conversation and letting the succession  plan evolve.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:13:37):**  I really appreciate that because that's something that I struggle with both sides of my family  and my husband's family is, is can we just actually have a conversation and start the  dialogue because I think they're too afraid of maybe there's some shame and guilt and  
**[0:13:52-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:13:52):**  they don't want to admit to what it looks like on both sides.  But I think they also want to have everything figured out before we can even begin the discussion.  It's like, I don't really need that either.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:14:04):**  I just, I just want you to be aware of what your, your goals are and what your wishes  are.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:14:09):**  And something that came up on the previous podcast, I think it's kind of important to  revisit is just because you have one, one child say one day, one time, dad, I'd be really  upset if you ever sold the ranch without ever having any other conversations, you know,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:14:30):**  you go and change your will, leave it all to that kid or whatever.  And as it turns out, you really didn't capture and pass on what was important about the ranch,  whether it was the land or the cattle or the lifestyle or, or just the scenery, you know,  
**[0:14:48-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:14:48):**  it's don't assume, have the conversation and really try to get down and capture the  meaning of, of, of what's wanted and what's desired.  Yeah.

It's it that's, that's incredibly hard like to, um, cause especially the generation  is that came like my parents.  So we're dealing with four different generations.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:15:18):**  Wow.  For in, in one.  And so when I say generations, I mean, my parents are from one generation.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:15:26):**  I have a set of, I have a brother and two sisters in a different generation generation.  They're baby brothers, my other brothers are and I'm a early millennial, you know, so like  our way of dealing the world with the world, seeing the world, it is so different, so different.  
**[0:15:45-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:15:45):**  And you know, me being the youngest, more most open of all of them.  I mean, the way that they, everybody else is closed off just drives me insane.  And I, I would love, I would love for them to be able to see it from, from that point  
**[0:16:04-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:16:04):**  of view, but I'm sure I'm probably a little too open for the rest of them.  So when you're dealing with family dynamics, especially in a family as diverse in age.  So my brother is 25 years older than me.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:16:18):**  My parents were in there.  My dad was almost 50 when I was born.  So my dad's 85 now and I'm 37.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:16:26):**  And it's just, it's so crazy how, how time has shifted and things have changed in just  like in just while we've had just this one generation.  Just really, it's a really impressive how, how the world has changed in just that little  
**[0:16:47-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:16:47):**  bit of time.  I think it's crazy how much the world has changed just in the last five years.  I mean, even the last 12 months dealing with COVID is it's the speed of change just seems  
**[0:17:00-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:00):**  like it's getting faster and faster and faster every year.  So let's shift a little bit.  Let's let's talk about your ranch.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:12):**  So let's talk about, well, where are you at first off?  What's your context?  I'm in, I'm in the Northern Ozarks.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:20):**  So I'm in, just outside of Cuba, Missouri.  I always try to stay out.  We're a little bit more to the St. Louis side, but I always say it's about halfway between  
**[0:17:32-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:32):**  St. Louis and Springfield, Missouri on Interstate 44.  If you know where Raleigh, Fort Leonard Wood, anybody knows where Fort Leonard Wood, we're  about an hour from Fort Leonard Wood.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:46):**  This is grass country.  Not very far from us to the North is corn country, you know, so, but what people, I  think a lot of people think about Missouri, especially Northern Missouri, it's all row  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:17:58):**  crops, but yeah, here it's where we're growing.  Beautiful, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:18:04):**  I have a best friend who's kind of in that area and I tell them every time we get close  to visiting him, I say, whenever I hear the banjo music, we know we're there.  Just totally kidding.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:18:14):**  But just have to say that.  I'll say this about how beautiful my wife and I over in September of last year, we went  out West for two weeks, just her and I, and you know, some of the, we went to Rocky Mountain,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:18:28):**  National Park, Tetons, Yellowstone, did all the things, right?  And as pretty and as beautiful as it all was, the prettiest sight is when we turned off  of Interstate 70 to come South and from about an hour and a half from home and started seeing  
**[0:18:44-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:18:44):**  the trees and hills of home.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's the most beautiful place to me that you could raise a family, raise cattle.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:18:54):**  It's just amazing.  So but as far as my ranch is concerned, we have about a hundred, my part of it is about  150 head.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:19:05):**  We live in the middle of about 700 acres.  We have another place that's just over a hundred acres.  So we are just starting with, we're a cow calf operation and we do a little bit of backgrounding  
**[0:19:21-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:19:21):**  of yearlings, really starting to get more involved in more regenerative, more managed  grazing, especially over at my smaller place.  And I made an Instagram post about this and I'm pretty sure I tagged you in it, Brian.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:19:39):**  The other day, I have two places.  I have this my home farm where things are probably a little more conventional.  You know, I'm trying to get them more in line, but we still cut and bale our own hay.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:19:54):**  You know, it's just, there's some places that are probably a little bit more continuous  grazing than I'd like.  And it causes me just a little, it's just not a little bit, a lot more of a headache.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:20:05):**  But I go over to that place where I, that hundred acres where I, that's where I keep  my heifers and this whole summer I did, or this whole winter I did strip grazing.  Now I'm moving paddocks with them and just doing, trying to do as many moves and trying  
**[0:20:22-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:20:22):**  to get as creative with, I can, as I can with the grazing and the joy that that part of  it brings me.  I'm going to be honest, it might keep it, it might keep me in the business, you know,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:20:37):**  like just as far as my own, like my own stress level goes down, my own mental health gets  better when I'm over there.  Just because I just like, it's so freeing and so like liberating to see animals just  
**[0:20:51-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:20:51):**  be animals and try to, try to them figure things out and get a little bit more like  nature intended them to be.  And I find that when I reconnect over there, it's just so good for me.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:21:07):**  And I'm just so happy that I've made the decision to do that over there.  And hopefully, not hopefully, it will transfer over to this home place where we can be a  little bit more mindful of that here.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:21:22):**  Awesome.  So what, so tell me about summer gerative practices.  You mentioned strip grazing and daily moves.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:21:30):**  And you know, I gotta tell you that I definitely agree with you about the mental health benefits  of just being in close contact with grazing animals that are calm and just doing what  they're meant to do.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:21:44):**  And you can't do it from the feed wagon.  Because you go out there in the feed truck, they're gonna all come running to you because  they want feed.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:21:53):**  They're going to quit what they're doing.  And they're going to be interested in you.  Every time you go out to the pasture, you change their behavior.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:01):**  And if you go out there often enough, they're used to ignoring you at times.  Right.  And you know, like, you know, when you're walking your fences for your heifers and running  
**[0:22:11-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:11):**  your reels, they know what you're out there doing.  They know when you're out there to do it.  But when you're out there just to look at them, they ignore you, right?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:20):**  Sure.  Yeah, no, it's like they just they put their heads down, they look up at me for a minute,  and they put their heads back down and eat and, you know, listening to them eat and move  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:31):**  and it's just, you know, they're calm.  I'm calm.  It's just such a serene experience.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:40):**  I love listening to cows eat while I drink my coffee.  It's my favorite thing in the world.  My favorite sound in the world is cows chomping grass.  
**[0:22:47-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:22:47):**  I just I love it.  And it's probably one of those sounds that's almost like fingernails on a chalkboard.  I guess some people probably don't mind that either.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:23:03):**  So what how high have you been pushing stock density on your daily moves?  So I haven't really been measuring that I'm still new to it.  That's something that I you know, I don't keep a whole lot of track of my weights, which  
**[0:23:20-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:23:20):**  I know it's something I should do.  Right.  I'm so new that I I just want to get in the habit of moving them first.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:23:32):**  Yeah.  Then start with stock density, because in in I would love to do everything perfect,  but I some a mold I have to break out of is not trying to not waiting till things are  
**[0:23:50-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:23:50):**  perfect to just do them.  And if I would sit there and I know I need to do this, and I know I need to calculate  stock density and I know it's important to the overall bottom line and the overall health  
**[0:24:01-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:24:01):**  and everything I know that but I the way I figure is if I started just by doing it just  by trying to get in the habit of these moves, trying to just eyeball things at first and  then try to bring it back, I'm going to set myself up for success a little bit better.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:24:23):**  So yeah, I don't actually know my stock density right now as far as pounds to the acre, but  it's...  Well, let me know if you want to use some pasture map for free.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:24:36):**  Yeah, for real.  I mean, and that's...  CK will help you.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:24:39):**  We'll do it automatically.  So Brian's sitting here staring at me.  That's something that I think is would be very valuable to me is to...  
**[0:24:53-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:24:53):**  It's not so...  In Missouri, it's not so easy to just go out and have square...  Because we don't have the structure of square fields.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:02):**  You know what I mean?  I mean, this...  We've got creeks and hollers and everything else and our fields look like...  
**[0:25:14-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:14):**  Sometimes look like tornadoes, sometimes look like snakes.  I mean, it's just so irregular out here that something like that would be super helpful  for me.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:25):**  Right now, I'm relying on some old barbed wire and putting my poly off of that and using  a portable charger, but I'm in the process of putting in all hot wire around and doing  that and actually...  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:43):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's a work in progress, right?  It is.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:46):**  It sounds like it's already a positive impact though, so that's what keeps you going.  So that's all that matters.  It is.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah, and it's a little bit better every year.  You know, last year, last winter, I strip grazed one field.  This past winter, I strip grazed two.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:26:01):**  So I mean, every year getting a little bit better and I think the big thing is realizing  that it's more than about just me and my experience with it.  I've got four boys that I'm raising doing this too and helping me out and figuring this  
**[0:26:18-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:26:18):**  stuff out with me and it's about them too.  We wanna go back to succession planning.  We wanna set... we wanna kinda change the legacy here a little bit.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:26:35):**  We want it to be more about the land.  We wanted that to be what's important to us and not saying...  I don't wanna say anything against my dad or my brothers.  
**[0:26:47-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:26:47):**  They did everything the best way they could, the way that they thought it should be done.  Probably a way that was profitable for them coming up, but it's not gonna be profitable  the way... that way for me.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:00):**  And especially it isn't going to be for my kids when, you know, who knows what's going  to happen in the next 20, 30 years.  So to do it and to ranch and to ranch in a way that is enjoyable and not as stress-free,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:19):**  I think that's super, super big and that's the part that I'm trying to play here.  I think especially because if it is stressful, you absorb that energy and you take it home  with you.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:30):**  So 100%.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you know, daily moves, I think we can both agree, you know, you have time to do  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:42):**  it.  Everybody has time to do it.  What else do you do?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:46):**  What's your... you have a day job, don't you, Jason?  I have a day job.  I'm a pharmacist.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:27:51):**  I work 40 hours a week as a pharmacist, you know?  So I mean, that's really interesting to have that dynamic of having a town job with being...  So I had, and I was thinking about that this week.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:28:08):**  I grew up with this kind of idyllic idea of what agriculture was because I...  Well, first of all, my dad was older when I was a kid.  I mean, my dad was 65 when I graduated high school, right?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:28:25):**  I mean, he was...  My dad's the same age as most of my friends grandpa's or close to it anyway.  He was friends with their grandpa's always.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:28:35):**  And I saw him and I saw him when he was in his 50s and I didn't see the struggles that  he had to go through and the hard work and the, you know, crunching numbers that I'm  having to go through.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:28:54):**  And I thought, well, I guess maybe I almost felt entitled a little bit to a certain type  of life involved in agriculture.  But it took me just a few years even out of college to know that it was totally different  
**[0:29:09-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:29:09):**  for me.  So working a town job, but also trying to manage a cow calf operation, it can look a  little bit different, you know what I mean?

**[0:29:39-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:29:39):**  cattle operation.  You know, there was a part of me at one time that wanted to be involved in registered cattle.  But when you work a 40 hour a week job, you start to understand, and then you have four  
**[0:29:58-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:29:58):**  kids who are involved in everything, you start to realize that, yeah, that part of it wasn't  that important to me.  And coming back to everything that we've talked about, being more involved in the family side  
**[0:30:15-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:30:15):**  of it, the family dynamic side, the regenerating the land, trying to do a better job with that.  You really start to figure out what's really important and what's worth your time and your  effort really fast.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:30:29):**  But to go back to my job, yeah, I'm a pharmacist and it's an interesting kind of meld between  my two lives as a rancher and as a pharmacist because I find myself almost contradicting  myself at times.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:30:52):**  But the real thing is, I've come to a comfortable place where I understand how important medicine  can be.  And not just the treatment of mental health, but the treatment of all kinds of health.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:31:07):**  It's a great, great, what happens is we get in trouble when we rely too much on it.  Just like we do with inputs in a cattle operation, we rely too much on inputs in our own health  as well.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:31:25):**  And we have these crutches.  So I was just thinking about this the other day, a guy kind of joking with me, he couldn't  get his cholesterol medicine filled for whatever reason, I don't remember.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:31:38):**  And he said, I guess I just won't eat McDonald's this week or something like that.  Or you could just not eat McDonald's that much at all.  Yeah, let's talk about the real reason you're probably taking this cholesterol medicine.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:31:53):**  Exactly.  So I mean, it's an interesting, I find myself in an interesting place a lot of the time  trying to optimize health of people, but also trying to utilize modern medicine.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:08):**  It's an interesting place to be.  It's almost like I say, almost contradictory at times.  Like you feel like you're enabling people?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:16):**  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  But at the same time, I feel like I have an important role as someone who sees the overall  and I feel like I'm probably in the not as many people have that view of it like I do.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:32):**  Well, you're advocating for their health.  You're not necessarily trying to change their lifestyle or change their mind.  You're just saying, if you're trying to get better because you're taking this drug, here's  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:45):**  another alternative that might also help.  Here's a lifestyle change that might help, right?  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:51):**  100%.  Yeah, I mean, I'm there, like you say, it's a good way to put it.  And I don't know if I've ever really thought of it that way.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:32:58):**  But being an advocate for their health, always trying to, there are options.  You know what I mean?  Or you could look at it as a pharmacist, you're just a legal drug dealer.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:33:10):**  Exactly, right.  So let's talk about your cows for a little bit.  What kind of cows do you have?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:33:18):**  So I, you know, we grew up with charlay cows, charlay cross cows.  That's all my dad had.  That's all we ever had.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:33:28):**  And it wasn't working, it wasn't a day of working cows unless somebody got hurt with  charlay cows.  I mean, it was a constant.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:33:40):**  I remember having to reinforce fence with trucks backed up to the fence.  Really?  Do charlays have different dispositions than?  
**[0:33:50-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:33:50):**  These ones did.  The ones I grew up with did.  They were our cat, so just needless to say, my dad did not select for disposition.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:34:00):**  Okay.  That's kind of obvious.  It was honestly, well, so I don't know if I mentioned this earlier, but my dad owned  
**[0:34:10-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:34:10):**  the sale barn for 30 years too.  So I mean, that was, I'm sure he took whatever was going to make money, right?  And sometimes what made money wasn't always the truth.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:34:23):**  No one else wanted.  Exactly.  There's always a reason she's at the sale barn.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:34:28):**  That's exactly right.  So I've found myself having to shift my genetics.  I use pretty much exclusively, I use stabilizer bulls out of Colorado, leech wing bulls.  
**[0:34:44-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:34:44):**  A friend of mine, and when I was trying to go through this transition of moving away  from sale barn cattle and keeping my own, I have a friend, a mentor just down the road  for me who had been using leechman cattle for, since the, I think he said 97, and just  
**[0:35:04-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:35:04):**  impeccable herd, such good health, such good calving ease.  They didn't always wean the heaviest, but never had to pull a calf.  So I mean, what was that?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:35:19):**  And that's, I think that's a big part of what I maybe differ from people in the fact that  I probably put a lot more value on my time inputs than maybe your typical rancher, especially  around here.  
**[0:35:40-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:35:40):**  My calves may weigh about 25 to 50 pounds less at weaning or at sale date, but I'm going  to guarantee you they had to pull a lot more calves than I did.  And they had a lot more calves that didn't stand and suck in the time that mine were  
**[0:36:01-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:36:01):**  up and running.  But also another thing is I calve my cows in springtime on the grass, not when there's  snow on the ground, if I can help it.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:36:14):**  You know, sometimes those late April snows like this year, like what the heck?  This is Missouri, not Alberta.  But so yeah, I mean, genetics wise, we use an Angus cross, but you know, always a good,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:36:32):**  try to have a good mix of English and continental cattle.  But that's back to a Charley cow, right?  Probably Yeah, more of Charley cross cow.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:36:41):**  Yeah, I'll tell you what my favorite cows have been some pins gour.  I have this line of pins gour cross cattle.  I've got I can't remember we have a, I know three or four generations of them on the farm  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:36:56):**  right now.  See, we're east of the hundredth parallel.  So I call what you guys would call a ranch, I call a farm.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:37:03):**  So it's, I think that's the dividing line there.  I always have to remind myself.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:37:10):**  Like, because I mean, we typically we really are ranch.  But when you're I think, anywhere east of Kansas, you call them you call them farm,  but you use the term interchangeably.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:37:24):**  And see, I, you know, my culture slightly different farm is, you know, when I hear farm,  that's crop tillage, that's tillage, that's growing annuals.  And when I hear ranch, that's primarily a livestock operation.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:37:38):**  In my mind,  and I and and I mean, in the traditional sense of the words, that's what it is, right?  Or at least in the modern, a modern sense, I guess I should say.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:37:51):**  But we've always just used, because there are no real farms around here.  You know, there are there's not much conventional tillage in my area.  So you would even call me a cattle farmer sometimes, or not sometimes, I think a lot  
**[0:38:09-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:38:09):**  of the time.  So I think that the word is just kind of used interchangeably.  Because when I think of ranching, I think of, I think of more like a desert type atmosphere,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:38:23):**  more mountain type atmosphere, things done on horseback.  That's what I usually think of.  So I don't know, it's, it's interesting.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:38:32):**  That is interesting.  What the difference in what part of the country you're standing in?  And, and it kind of has a strange switch you get out in the far west, you know, especially  
**[0:38:42-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:38:42):**  in California, everything's a ranch.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, if you have two acres outside of city limits, you've got a ranch.  
**[0:38:51-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah, they sell them.  They sell them as ranches.  There was a, the one that comes to mind is, several years ago, we bought some strawberries.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:39:04):**  And it said Christopher Ranch, California.  I'm like, ranches don't grow strawberries, ranches grow cows.  Farms grow strawberries.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:39:12):**  But every everything out there is a ranch.  I mean, from the strawberry farm to to Harris Ranch, which is what like 100,000 head feed  lot.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:39:21):**  So, you know, there is a little bit of difference in language between, you know, the folks in  Maine and the folks in California.  Yeah, yeah, I find that really interesting how we can be in all essentially can be in  
**[0:39:32-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:39:32):**  the same industry and have such different language and not just different language,  but different cultures, right?  Yeah, I mean, for real, I mean, even here, like here versus somewhere like, I'd say probably  
**[0:39:47-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:39:47):**  Missouri is just one of those weird states where it's very diverse, as far as the ground.  But like our culture around farming and ranching is completely different than it would be in  say like Georgia, or somewhere where the landscape and the things we have to deal with are very  
**[0:40:05-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:05):**  similar.  But just the culture around it is so much different.  I remember meeting a cowboy from Alberta, and he told me that that's the Texas of Canada  
**[0:40:19-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:19):**  is Alberta.  And then he was telling me how he can always tell if it's an American cowboy versus like  a Canadian cowboy because we wear those wild racks, and they don't.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:29):**  They're like, it doesn't even get cold enough where you guys are from.  And I don't know why she knew the wild racks.  I remember making fun of that.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:36):**  I was like, whatever.  I'm just cold.  It's cold.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:39):**  Yeah.  But it's just funny.  There's culture everywhere.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:42):**  And it's just interesting when you see people who've learned something different and it's  okay.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:40:49-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:40:49):**  I want hat culture is kind of funny too.  It's almost getting to the point you can kind of look at the overall shape of somebody's  hat and tell, well, they're from maybe the Northern Plains or they might be from Canada  
**[0:41:01-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:01):**  or that's the Southwest influence or that's more of a Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas thing.  That's so funny.  I did that the other day, Brian.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:14):**  It's like, is he from Texas?  Yeah.  When you see something out of the normal, you got to kind of go, huh, I wonder where  
**[0:41:24-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:24):**  that guy's been.  I wonder where he got that hat.  So what are, have you had any wrecks lately?  
**[0:41:34-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:34):**  Oh, yeah.  I'm dealing with pink eye this year, worse than I have ever had it.  Not ever, shouldn't say ever.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:48):**  My first year of ever having cattle was the worst year I ever had pink eye.  With both herds?  No.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:41:55):**  No.  At my home farm.  I have a lot more.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:42:02):**  We do.  And I think it's, I don't know if it's the weather.  I don't know, because my management hasn't really changed at home.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:42:17):**  Maybe we have, I think we probably might have a little, I had a little more fescue stem  this year and that fescue coming off in their eye can be a real bad irritant and cause pink  eye.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:42:31):**  But you know, now that you say that, those heifers over at my other place, we don't,  I think maybe I've had one with a runny eye, but it never got to full blown pink eye.  And it's something to be said, right, for the management technique.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:42:49):**  So your theory is you're having less pink eye trouble on your heifers because of the  intensive moves and strip grazing program?  Yes.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, I feel like that.  Yeah, I feel like that.  I feel like the flies aren't as bad because they're not staying where they crap as often.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:06):**  I just feel like overall health is better.  You know, I feel like their hair coats are better.  You know, I just think there's so many, I can just see, just in this little sample size,  
**[0:43:20-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:20):**  I can see so many more benefits over there.  Cattle and land both.  Just such a difference.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:30):**  Now are they on the same supplement package?  Yeah, yeah.  We have a custom mix for breeding.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:39):**  I have a custom mineral that I get out of a place.  We use garlic a lot.  Do you use garlic?  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:47):**  I love garlic.  Yes.  It's amazing.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:50):**  Even for me.  I even put it on my food.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:43:55):**  So yeah, they're on a very similar mineral package.  But those heifers over there, they don't get a whole lot of, that's about all they get.  I try to give them, I give everybody a fighting chance, but nobody gets any free rides.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:44:18):**  Not giving them anything special, just treating them just like the cows you wish they were.  Exactly.  That's exactly right.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:44:24):**  Yep.  We don't give, there was a time when I started raising my own heifers.  I would grain them for 90 days to try and get them to that size.  
**[0:44:40-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:44:40):**  But then I realized that size is just a number.  I want a cow that can calve at a thousand pounds and still do it easily if she can.  There's no reason to get a cow, have to get a cow a heifer to 800 pounds before calving  
**[0:45:03-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:45:03):**  if I don't want her to be a 1,400 pound cow.  My mindset around, I'll tell you what, my mindset around cattle and around land management  really changed.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:45:16):**  Brian I talked to you about this, the time I met Burke Teichert.  Funny story about Burke, I don't know if he still does or not, but he had the back page  of Beef Magazine and he always puts his email in there.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:45:34):**  Something just struck me about what, I can't remember what even the article was, I said,  I would love to just talk to you sometime.  I'd love to just have a phone call with you sometimes just to try to soak up just a thumbnail  
**[0:45:48-0:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:45:48):**  worth of knowledge that you have.  Funny enough, he was partners with some people on a ranch in Missouri about a little less  than two hours south of me.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:00):**  He says, I'm actually coming there this weekend.  He says, why don't you come and see the operation?  Oh, very cool.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:07):**  Yeah.  They were calving at the time, it had a fall calving herd, he introduced me to the Sand  Hills calving system.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:14):**  Right, system.  Yeah.  Wow.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:18):**  I think that was really where the time changed for me.  Then got really intentional about really paying attention to Burke's methodology.  He talks about cow and heifer development so much.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:32):**  Giving them, like you say, trying, like Brian said, trying to mold them and treat them like  the cows you want them and desire them to be.  And man, that's been, that's really affected my bottom line since then.  
**[0:46:46-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:46:46):**  Not just bottom line, but time spent with them.  You know, a cow has any sort of problems calving, she's gone.  No cow raises good enough calf to be worth her problems.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:47:00):**  That's never, you know, so I mean, that's been about four years now.  And it's just been, I mean, I think the person you could probably talk to that would illustrate  how much the change has been, would be my wife, would be Carrie, because she can see  
**[0:47:19-0:47:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:47:19):**  how much it's changed for me, right?  How much my life has gotten better and how much our lives have gotten better because  of it.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:47:29):**  Just simply, and it was all just, it was all little simple things.  It was just taking grain away, letting them be on grass, moving them daily, you know,  trying to take away the monetary inputs and maybe still having, you know, daily moves  
**[0:47:47-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:47:47):**  is that's an input, don't get me wrong, your times were something, but enjoying your time  that you spend with them and, you know, enjoying that daily moves, man, it's just, it's been  night and day.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:48:02):**  And yet when you bring in those cattle that you've been moving daily, especially if you're  doing it on foot, when you bring them into the corrals and you have to work with them,  they're so much calmer and easier to work with than if you just left them out in the  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:48:18):**  pasture for the last six months and you're going to go discover them and round them up  with 15 cowboys and 12 dogs.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:48:25):**  You know, it's being used to that human contact.  It really jettles them down and you'd be amazed at what, you know, one or two people can get  done with a couple of hundred head and a set of pens when they've been worked with and  
**[0:48:37-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:48:37):**  calmed down and jettled for six months.  You know, my sons and I, I don't have any help really.  It's my sons and I, my oldest is 16 and then we have another, a 10 year old and we just  
**[0:48:52-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:48:52):**  out, we went out and before we were on here today, we took advantage of this cool July  day and worked some cows here at home.  And even the ones here, they still see me on foot.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:49:03):**  You know, they still, they don't, we don't do the daily moves here like we do over at  the other place, but they still see me on foot plenty.  And it's amazing when you put some intentionality behind it and just use a little bit of stockmanship  
**[0:49:16-0:49:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:49:16):**  because I remember my dad would hire people and that was probably more than the cattle,  it was the people.  I just remember, not to dog on how I grew up or anything or how, but I mean, I think  
**[0:49:28-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:49:28):**  we all have stories like this and I just remember like everybody be so damn loud and making  so much damn noise and just screaming and yelling and hitting and sorting sticks and  whips and like, ah, I mean, I just remember it's like, I remember even being a child and  
**[0:49:47-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:49:47):**  like, man, that's not, that can't be great, right?  That can't be great for them.  They don't want to, I mean, when somebody hits and whips me, what do I want to do?  
**[0:49:56-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:49:56):**  I want to lay down.  I don't want to do what they want me to do.  So I mean, when you get, when we put the sorting sticks away, when we put the whips away, when  
**[0:50:04-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:04):**  we just started being more intentional with how we treat the animals, wow, I mean, it  makes a big difference.  And I mean, we worked, I mean, it wasn't a ton of cattle.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:17):**  I think we had a set of like 30 cows and 20 calves that we worked this morning.  It took us an hour, you know, and it probably could have taken us less time, but we enjoyed  the time together, you know, fathers and sons.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:33):**  And it's just when you treat the cattle, just, I don't want to say nicer, but just when you're  calmer around them.  Intentional.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:47):**  Intentional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:50):**  Intentional.  Exactly.  Being intentional when you go to the pasture, when you step into the pen of why you're there.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:50:57):**  Yeah.  And I just want to say it's harder to do that than the other way.  Like to not lose your shit.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:51:06):**  Yeah.  I mean, I'd love to lose my shit all the time, right?  I mean, it would be way easier for me to just blow up, you know?  
**[0:51:15-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:51:15):**  And that's another thing.  I mean, I tell stories here, but because they're relatable.  So we always work calves.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:51:26):**  We work our fall calves and then we wean our spring calves around Thanksgiving every year.  And my son's, my oldest son at the time, he was the only one who was having a show steer  at the time.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:51:42):**  And he said, you know, Mom, I really get excited when it's time to work cows because it's time  for my steer.  He said, but dad's so mean.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:51:53):**  Like and I and that was probably about the same time ago, like probably about four years  to go.  And I was I was just kind of a dick to everybody.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:02):**  And when he said that, I mean, he was probably 12.  I guess he would have been probably 12 at the time.  It made me think like, I'm doing it wrong.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:12):**  You know?  Yeah.  I think everybody can relate to that getting yelled and screamed at by their dads while  
**[0:52:16-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:16):**  they're oh, my husband's like working with my husband is like we just we know not to  get in each other's own.  So we're working.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:23):**  Yeah, exactly.  So, yeah, try.  It goes back to that more intentionality.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:29):**  And, you know, I said, you know, from that point on, I said, you know, I'll I mean, believe  me, I've had my blow ups.  We all do because right.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:37):**  If you're in a perfect and cattle will make you do things that you would wish you rather  would not have.  But, you know, it goes back to that word.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:45):**  Brian, I like you said that intentionality and just being more intentional with how you  are around cattle and people, you know, I I'm not gonna lie, I, I still get to the point  where I'm frustrated with cattle.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:52:58):**  And I found the best thing to do.  They're frustrated.  Not doing what you want them to do is leave.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:04):**  Mm hmm.  Yep.  And then you go do something else.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:07):**  Calm down.  Clear your mind.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:10):**  Let your cattle calm down and then go up and then go approach them with intention, with  calm intention and the mindset that you're a herd mate.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:21):**  You know that that you're a herd mate, that you're there with them and not trying to make  them do something.  You know, not not using force.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:31):**  Yeah, exactly.  So where so you just kind of came about, you know, low stress stockmanship by observing  the older generation and going, that's not so great.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:42):**  And then hearing your kids say, Dad, you're kind of a jerk to cows.  Do I have that I capture that?  Pretty much?  
**[0:53:49-0:54:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:53:49):**  Yeah, that's pretty, pretty, pretty spot on.  And I'll say, you know, my brother, one of the quietest cattle handlers I've ever seen.  It was never him.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:02):**  It was the people, but it would be the people that would come.  And I'll just it just really left a bad taste in my mouth and helped me understand.  And then and then, like you say, when when your son says something to you like, but that's  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:20):**  like stops you in your tracks.  Like, oh, yeah, you've got to change then.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:26):**  And big question by your child as to why you did something.  You know, we could we could, you know, we can laugh about it.  But I mean, sometimes it's you do something without thinking about your kids.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:40):**  Like, why did you do that?  You're like, oh, yeah, crap.  Why did I do that?  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:45):**  Humility, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yep, exactly.  
**[0:54:50-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:54:50):**  So, uh, so how's your hay season going this year?  Oh, man, you had to do it.  It's been the worst hay season of my entire life.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:01):**  I think a lot of people are having that saying that right.  Like we have someone in Houston.  He's like, we are like three cuttings behind because we're just swimming in water.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:11):**  Oh, yeah.  It's just, you know, Missouri.  And I'm sure probably a lot of places say this.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:16):**  We're never it's it's like you said earlier, Brian, we're never two weeks away, more than  two weeks away from a drought.  And that was never so evident this summer.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:27):**  We it rained all spring long and was cool.  And then all of a sudden it wasn't right, you know, and it just stopped.  And we had, you know, 90 degrees with, you know, low humidity and winds and it was perfect  
**[0:55:41-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:41):**  hay, making weather.  But I, my I can't remember what happened.  What happened this the first time.  
**[0:55:50-0:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:55:50):**  And something we got some our auger bent on our baler.  And it's just been a fight ever since then.  Something else, either electrical or mechanical is I broke two different times of summer broke  
**[0:56:04-0:56:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:56:04):**  belts, you know, and they don't ever break it like convenient times.  Right.  That's the thing about putting up hay is if something breaks, like, what do you do?  
**[0:56:13-0:56:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:56:13):**  You know, I've been very fortunate to have some neighbors come and help me out.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:56:20):**  I'd be I'd be sunk if it wasn't for I'd be sunk if it wasn't for neighbors and for my  oldest son, taking care of everything while I'm not able to, you know, at work and other  obligations.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:56:32):**  But it's gotten me as talking with my friend August horseman.  He lives just down the road from me and you know, I, I kind of shared some of the struggles  I was having with him.  
**[0:56:46-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:56:46):**  And it goes to show that how important just not even harvesting the feed can be and trying  to let the cow do the harvesting herself.  You know, there's no baler breaking down if the cow has to eat the grass herself.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:57:04):**  You know, at a certain point in time, just trying to limit the number of times a machine  came into contact with that forage is, and I again, I've got a long way.  to go to where but I'm really starting to see the value of less conventional tactics.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:57:25):**  It's a journey.  Ellen molar, Ellen molar said it best soil health is a journey.  You start where you are.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:57:35):**  So what to the little story you just related kind of makes me wonder, how can we build  better relationships with our neighbors?  How can we build a better spirit of cooperation with our neighbors?  
**[0:57:49-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:57:49):**  So I had Sam Goldberg on Sam Goldberg is the producer of silo the film, the film about  the grain entrapment and Sam is an incredible guy.  He's just to think that someone like me can can connect with someone like Sam, a guy who  
**[0:58:12-0:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:58:12):**  grew up his entire life in Manhattan, New York City, is it gives me hope to be honest.  And he was it gives me hope for the future, you know, with all this crap that we've had  going down.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:58:28):**  And he was talking about the important I think at one certain time in the future, what any  one person knew 95% of the people that lived within one mile of them.  Now, it's down to like 18% of the people that live within one mile of them.  
**[0:58:49-0:59:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:58:49):**  So I think the big thing about improving relations with our neighbors is getting to know our  neighbors.  Yeah, having a relationship at all.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:59:00):**  And I'm fortunate in that I live in a place where I have lived pretty much my entire life  where I live right now is I live just less than two miles as the crow flies away from  my childhood home for where my parents live now.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:59:17):**  And I'm actually the third one in my family to live in this house that I live in right  now.  So I have an advantage of already having relationships with a lot of neighbors because they're in  
**[0:59:29-0:59:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:59:29):**  similar situations and, you know, kids go to school together and whatnot.  But there are people that I know I could do better.  You know, I know I could do better at getting to know people.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:59:44):**  I realize this driving past this place that I drive past often, I don't even know who  these people are.  And they have cattle, you know, they could be some, we could have a really good relationship,  
**[0:59:59-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=0:59:59):**  but I haven't even tried.  And I think that's a big part of it, Brian, to answer your question is, how do we forge  better relationships?  
**[1:00:08-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:00:08):**  We try, you know, we try with people and, you know, I know it's hard.  People are busy.  I'm, we're all busy.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:00:16):**  I mean, but are we too busy to get to know our neighbors just a little bit better and  try to forge relationships that are going to be a mutual benefit for who knows how many  years?  
**[1:00:30-1:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:00:30):**  I don't think you can ever be that you should ever be that busy.  Not being busy.  Oh, wait, we had a conversation here at the house last night about, you know, part of  
**[1:00:46-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:00:46):**  our culture here in the Midwest is, you know, if you're not working sun up to sun down,  you're just a lazy pile of crap.  I don't think that's just a Midwest thing.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:00:56):**  Because being from California and my family, husband, family in Idaho, it's a cowboy culture.  Like it's an agriculture culture too.  It drives me nuts.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:09):**  Where's the pride in working 80 hour weeks?  You know, 30, 40 weeks a year.  That, yeah, you work hard.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:18):**  Cool.  Like, where's your, what's your quality of life like?  You know, do you, when do you spend time with your family?  
**[1:01:24-1:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:24):**  When do you spend time on you?  They tie shame, right?  Shame is tied to anyone who doesn't work that many hours.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:32):**  Like if they're comparing, I feel like then that person's a lazy POS is what kind of I  heard this.  There's a stigma where it's like, oh, he only works 40 hours.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:41):**  Like what does he do in the other 20 hours?  And I fall victim to that so much.  We there's a crap.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:01:54):**  I'm going to butcher it because there's a quote by Brené Brown.  It takes courage to, to rest and to play in a society or in our case, an industry that  sees that sees exhaustion or as a, wears it as a badge of honor.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:02:17):**  So I mean, when the status quo is to be exhausted and to work your ass off and doing me wrong,  hard work.  Absolutely.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:02:27):**  But be again, Brian, I keep going back to that word intentionality.  What is, what is most important to you?  What's how can you be most intentional and do the work that really matters at this end?  
**[1:02:40-1:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:02:40):**  Also take time for your family, take time for yourself, take time for forging relationships.  You know, there needs to be some compromise there.  There's no, there's no award for being the most tired, being the most exhausted.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:02:57):**  And then you get mental illness, burnout, everything else that comes with that.  Physical illness too.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:03:05):**  I mean all kinds of things.  I mean, it's you know, it's I always had these personal little anecdotes here, but I have  a brother who is a civil engineer and I love him.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:03:23):**  He's probably one of my best friends and the guy bless his heart, he works 80 hours a week,  owns a civil engineering firm, you know, works his tail off.  And you know, he's got a nice life.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:03:35):**  He's got a nice, you know, he's got a big piece of land there in the reining horses.  They do reining.  They do all kinds of high dollar horses.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:03:47):**  He had a heart attack when he was not even 40.  You know, so I mean, that's younger than I am.  Don't say things like that.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:03:55):**  I could think he was about the age when he had it.  He was about the age I am now.  And I don't want that for my kids.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:04:05):**  I don't want that for my wife.  I don't want that for myself.  So taking the time to understand what's really important to you.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:04:16):**  You think you're just going to have, like you say, quality of life, using that as, you  know, using that on your bottom line too.  And you know, you have to start seeing yourself.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:04:30):**  I talked to this about, I can't take credit for this, a friend of mine, Adrian de Sutter,  talked to me about this, seeing yourself as an asset.  You know, we put a value on a herd of cattle.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:04:42):**  We put a value on a piece of land.  We put value on a piece of equipment.  But do we really put value on ourselves?  
**[1:04:52-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:04:52):**  Do we view ourselves as assets?  Most of the time, probably not.  Sometimes I feel like I'm more of a liability.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:05:02):**  Exactly.  So I mean, changing your mindset around that is trying to make sure you're in the best  shape so everything can go well is important too.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:05:18):**  And you know, keep a positive mindset.  Because I think, just recently, I was already out of bed and like doing my things to get  out the door to go to work.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:05:29):**  And I got a call that I have cows on the highway.  It didn't ruin my day.  I ended up having a really great day.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:05:38):**  But you know, you can't let one thing ruin your day.  And you got to be able to roll with the punches and keep going.  And the intentionality, it circles back to the intentionality.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:05:53):**  Why are we here?  You know, we're here to grow food.  We're here to take care of these animals.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:00):**  We're here to take care of this land.  We're here to take care of this soil.  That's why we're here.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:05):**  And you just got to keep those things in mind.  Yeah, 100%.  Yep.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:10):**  Yep.  You just like, strip all the other crap away from it and get down to the real why.  And if you figure out the why, then you're gonna figure out your how pretty quick.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:24):**  So what are some tips to help figure out your why?  I, so I have a set of core values around pretty much everything that I do.  Around, you know, my wife and I have our own core values.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:39):**  We have our core values as a family.  I have my core values as a person and around our farm.  And when you hold these core values so close to you, and you make your decisions based  
**[1:06:55-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:06:55):**  on those core values, then it makes your life really simple.  You know, we, in our mission statement, we talk about putting only the inputs that are  necessary for us to maintain a profitable, sustainable and enjoyable operation.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:07:13):**  When you have something like that, a North Star, if you will, to try and work towards,  then it figures, you figure out your why.  So it just, it takes a little bit of brainstorm, a little bit of work.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:07:26):**  But then it makes after that, it makes it really simple.  My wife and I, for our relationship, we talk about how we want to spend time together,  we want to take time for our kids, but also for ourselves, and we also want to take time  
**[1:07:45-1:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:07:45):**  to travel.  So all of our decisions, whether they be financial or time commitments, if it doesn't add up  to that, if it doesn't fit in line with those core values, then it goes out the door.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:08:01):**  So I mean, getting a little bit of work saves you, a little bit of work on the front end  saves you a lot of work on the back end.  One of the things they talk about in holistic management is developing a holistic context.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:08:18):**  And then they give you the tools to start learning how to filter decisions through that  holistic context to basically come down to, should I do this or should I not do this?  Does this decision fit in line with my holistic context?  
**[1:08:36-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:08:36):**  And that's very similar to what you're talking about with core values and very similar  to having a mission and vision statement, not just for your business, but for your relationships  and your personal life.  
**[1:08:52-1:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:08:52):**  Why am I here?  What is my mission in life and what is my chosen mission in life?  And what principles am I going to use to guide my life and to guide my business?  
**[1:09:05-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:05):**  So any tips on how to start developing that?  Any places to look?  Oh gosh, there are, but I can't say them off the top of my head right now.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:16):**  I'm going to be really honest with you here.  My wife is like the big part.  She's the big player.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:24):**  A lot of these changes in my life.  So men, get you a good wife.  I think something you've shared, Jason, is on your podcast, you talked about Enogram  
**[1:09:39-1:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:39):**  types.  Yes.  Yes.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:42):**  Thank you.  Can you tell this for people who have never heard that, what that is and why that might  be helpful?  
**[1:09:48-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:09:48):**  Enogram is something that is, uh, that's really near and I'm nowhere, I'm not an expert.  Um, but it's kind of how you view the world and how you're almost like your North star  metric, right?  
**[1:10:02-1:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:02):**  Exactly.  Or your core values, core values.  And I am what they, you know, there's nine types of Enogram.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:10):**  Yeah.  Um, my type in there, they're typed one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  I'm a type three.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:17):**  Okay.  What that means?  The achiever, right?  
**[1:10:20-1:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:20):**  The achiever.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:23):**  I have the list.  Oh, okay.  All right.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:26):**  I wanted to ask this because we're talking about people in management.  I think that's like so crucial and like just understanding who you are and how you fit  in other people's roles.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:33):**  So we, and this has been the most valuable this has been, has been in my marriage and  really.  Okay.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:40):**  Awesome.  So Carrie is a six and the loyalist.  Okay.  
**[1:10:46-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:10:46):**  We would fight a lot.  Um, we couldn't figure out why.  And when we figured out the Enneagram two years ago, you're going to hear me say, oh,  
**[1:11:01-1:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:11:01):**  three or four years ago, two or three years ago.  That's when a lot of the, it sounds like you had your, yeah.  That's when I had my awakenings right all over the place and uh, we couldn't figure  
**[1:11:13-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:11:13):**  it out.  And she figured we figured we took the Enneagram and she found out that her basic need was  security.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:11:23):**  My need was to be recognized and me being recognized took, would sometimes take a lot  of her security away.  So my, you know, and with that being recognized, my desire for freedom and being, you know,  
**[1:11:42-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:11:42):**  putting myself out there and maybe the times, you know, that was maybe a little uncomfortable  for her.  Her desire for security was a little, um, closed off for me.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:11:55):**  And when we started figuring out that way, how we interacted with one another, I mean,  our marriage just, I mean, flourished after that.  Um, you know, I, I'd have to say it's one of the, one of the most important parts of  
**[1:12:09-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:12:09):**  our marriage is figuring out our Enneagram types and how we viewed the world and how  it, um, viewed our, our, how it shaped our interactions with one another.  So I mean, you can see how that, when it goes to take it back to a more people management  
**[1:12:27-1:12:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:12:27):**  standpoint, you could see it.  I mean, it seems silly, right?  I mean, I'll be first to admit I was very skeptical of it.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:12:35):**  Like, what could this mean?  You know, is this something you take on Buzzfeed or something?  Like one of those weird surveys that they're just trying to sell me something.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:12:43):**  Yeah.  But it's, it's not that, it's not that.  And um, it has a very faith based, if you go into it, it has a very faith based, um,  
**[1:12:55-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:12:55):**  history behind it.  And uh, you know, so for people who kind of view it as almost kind of, cause it does,  it almost seems like it has like pagan type symbolism.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:04):**  Like culty.  Yep.  Yep.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:07):**  Exactly.  Yeah, it does.  And I, I mean, believe me, I've felt all the thoughts about it.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:11):**  Um, but it is such a valuable tool.  And you know, when you have people who are working together in a team and you don't understand  their basic needs, um, you know, you can get all of those different pages really fast.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:26):**  And if you could, if you get a whole team building experience around the Enneagram,  um, I think it would make for a really sick, it, it, it could, it obviously wouldn't hurt  any anything and definitely, uh, would set up for success.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:44):**  Mm hmm.  Brian, you'll have to take the test and tell us where you are.  Yeah, I'll, I'll have to check that out.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:54):**  Make, send me a link so I can put it in the show notes.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:13:58):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really important.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:14:01):**  And um, I don't know if she has started it yet or not, but Taryn Drilling, um, she was,  her and I had a podcast on that and she is like a, she's super into the Enneagram and  she was talking about, uh, there was at one point she was going to start a podcast revolving  
**[1:14:19-1:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:14:19):**  around the Enneagram and how it can help people in agriculture.  Um, I don't think she's done that yet, but it's a, I know it's something that she is  going to work on sometime.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:14:33):**  Keep us updated on that.  I will.  Yeah.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:14:36):**  I think it could be, I think it could be a really valuable tool for people.  So I'd like to know what's the best advice that you wish you had on your first day ranching?  Oh man.  
**[1:14:53-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:14:53):**  But so best advice, man, that's uh, if I'm my first day ranching, that's a really good  question Brian.  I think it's do it your own way.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:15:12):**  There's there's going to, there's going to be so much, there's so much noise, right?  There's always somebody trying to sell you something, right?  Absolutely.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:15:22):**  So many, so many people trying to sell you stuff and you get really, if you spend your  money on enough stuff, you realize that you probably could have done without it pretty,  you know, and done.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:15:36):**  Okay.  Um, unfortunately I've probably spent, I'm spent more money than I'd like to admit on  things that didn't work.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:15:45):**  Um, when I should have just been focusing on more management type techniques and figuring  out what's most important to me and not what's most important to someone who's trying to  sell me something.  
**[1:15:55-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:15:55):**  Right.  Um, you know, not say, not trying to see what's most important to the industry standards,  if you will, ranch in a way that works for you.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:16:10):**  If you hear some good advice, take it.  If you hear some advice that sounds like it could be good or, you know, it sounds like  it might work, try it out on a small scale and try to build it from there.  
**[1:16:25-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:16:25):**  I think, and I think that's a big, another big thing is it goes back to me seeing my  dad and he did, at one time we had a thousand head, um, which is a lot of cattle for this  part of the country.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:16:38):**  Um, I, that kind of almost, uh, gave me a distorted reality a little bit, um, of what  I thought, cause I wanted to be big.  I thought the only way to be involved in it is to be big.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:16:55):**  But that's not the case.  You guys know that it takes, it takes ranches farms of all sizes to be, to be involved in,  you know, not worry about your size, not worry about your numbers, but worry about how you're  
**[1:17:09-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:17:09):**  contributing.  That's I like it.  That's fantastic.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:17:15):**  That's really good.  So thank you.  What's, uh, what's the biggest challenge you're facing right now?  
**[1:17:25-1:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:17:25):**  Biggest challenge I'm facing right now.  Um, I'm, my biggest challenge is, is planning, um, planning, grazing, uh, planning, marketing.  Um, you know, because we, I do, I do have a 40 hour a week town job and that takes a  
**[1:17:46-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:17:46):**  lot of my time and effort and it should because that's how, that's my primary source of income.  Um, so it should take my time.  Uh, but also trying to, to plan a successful ranch around that.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:17:59):**  Um, again, the theme for this podcast is intentionality.  Uh, Brian really hit it on the head early on there and being really intentional with  how I plan and how I, uh, you know, not just planning moves and marketing, but how I plan  
**[1:18:16-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:18:16):**  days when we work cows and trying to be really intentional with markets and weather and all  this stuff because, um, you know, I'd like to wean some calves right now, but I also  don't know that it's not going to be good for anybody involved to wean them in July  
**[1:18:31-1:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:18:31):**  heat in Missouri.  Um, so I mean, it's, uh, you know, trying to line things up and being, having a plan,  um, a plan that to me, I feel like a plan, even if you don't stick to it, just having  
**[1:18:48-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:18:48):**  a plan is better than no plan at all.  Um, having to vary from a plan.  Um, sometimes the plan, what actually happens doesn't look like the plan at all, but if  
**[1:18:57-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:18:57):**  it can be so meaningful to have a plan.  Um, and I'm finding that out when I don't have a plan.  Uh, it's not near as enjoyable and it's not near as profitable for me.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:19:10):**  Writing a plan down forces you to sit down and think about it and think through steps.  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:19:20):**  And if you've already thought through it and thought about some of the ways that things  could go wrong and thought about how to head those off at the pass.  You know, the plan you make the night before.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:19:35):**  You're right.  It, uh, let's see in the military.  They say no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:19:43):**  Mike Tyson said, everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face, you know, but  having a plan is important.  So you at least have a roadmap, right?  
**[1:19:53-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:19:53):**  Yep.  And like I said, the end result can look nothing like the plan, but the fact that you have  a plan and the fact that you're thinking ahead, um, it gets the gears turning and that's,  
**[1:20:07-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:07):**  what's really important about a plan.  So we're, we're kind of winding down here.  We've already talked about mention your Instagram, which is ag state of mind.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:16):**  I'll make sure I put that in the show notes along with, uh, you know, link to your podcast  and we'll put, uh, the vets in ag podcast in there.  And of course, since we talk about it and I haven't done it in a while, we'll put a  
**[1:20:28-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:28):**  link to that, that other working cows guy that got us.  I forget.  I don't know.  
**[1:20:33-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:33):**  Same guy.  Yeah.  That's the same guy that got us both started.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:38):**  Yeah.  Lots of gratitude.  He said in a good bar, I mean, 200 episodes, he's only missed what two or three weekly  
**[1:20:47-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:47):**  releases.  Pretty dang good, man.  I'll tell you that takes a lot of talk about a plan, right?  
**[1:20:53-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:20:53):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Speaking of the plan, I got, I got a plan sometime to edit an episode to release a little  
**[1:21:01-1:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:21:01):**  behind on that.  So before we, before we start to head out of here is anything on your mind you'd like  to know from me?  
**[1:21:11-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:21:11):**  Well, I want to know how you get that beard.  Like like how does that even work?  Like do you like the condition it?

Do you like, did you have like special genetic editing when you were a child?  Well, you just first step is Jason, you have to stop shaving.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:21:37):**  You have to put away your razor.  I knew I was doing something wrong.  But yeah, I, I, I never have done anything special.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:21:46):**  You know, I do put a conditioner, you know, I wash it with shampoo and conditioner and  then get out of the shower, put cream in it and brush it.  And it just kind of grows in all natural and beautiful like this.  
**[1:21:57-1:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:21:57):**  I guess I got blessed.  You take it blessed.  I've tried and I just, it just like goes straight.

**[1:22:10-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:10):**  Yeah.  It just my wife, my wife likes a clean shaven face.  So you do.

**[1:22:22-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:22):**  We can't have both.  My son has a mullet now.  They're super trendy.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:27):**  They are trendy.  People are actually like professionally perming them.  And I'm like, this is getting that eye in.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:33):**  Yeah.  So my son, my oldest is in high school and all of his buddies have it's 100% that looks  like kids in the 90s out of high school.

**[1:22:48-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:48):**  I don't know.  I probably had one at some point and thought it was cool.  I never had one.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/24-Jason-Meadows-Succession-is-like-Drought-e156p4t#t=1:22:54):**  I don't think and find the picture.  Now I can't grow hair.  So I know how that feels, Jason.

**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:00:51):**  Vishnishke.  I got it right.  We just had a discussion.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:00:57):**  Anyway, we're joined today by Carl Thiedman and Seth Itzkin from Soil for Climate.  So guys, welcome to Ranching Reboot.  Pleasure to be here.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:07):**  Thank you.  It's an honor.  So let's just start off.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:13):**  So what is Soil for Climate?  Carl, you want to take that one first and then I'll jump in.  Soil for Climate is a US-based nonprofit that advocates for soil restoration as a climate  
**[0:01:28-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:28):**  solution.  We were founded in 2015.  We work with some of the leading scientists, practitioners, journalists all around the  
**[0:01:37-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:37):**  world.  We've got over 22,000 members from more than 100 countries presently on our Facebook group.  And if any of your listeners want to follow this topic, we invite them to join.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:49):**  That's terrific.  So, Carl, tell me about some of the projects you guys are involved in, like specifically  the Maasai tribe.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:01:59):**  I'll get off to Seth.  Sure, sure.  I'll handle that one.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:02:04):**  But also let me kind of tether a little bit on Carl's response about us.  Yes, we are a nonprofit, a 501c3 nonprofit, and that's all corrected.  But I also like to think of us as really kind of like a player that's trying to kind of  
**[0:02:28-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:02:28):**  mix things up a little bit, if you will, really kind of be a voice of science, policy, practice  with a little bit of an attitude, frankly, and not being afraid to kind of turn the waters  a bit and push back against some of the miss messaging that's going on out there.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:02:56):**  And have a little bit of an attitude, let's put it that way.  So in terms of our projects, we like to use a tagline that we're involved in the science,  the policy, and the practice.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:03:11):**  And then the science specifically, we refer to the science of range management that supports  building soil carbon.  And the leaders in that area, of course, are Richard Teague, the Texas A&M, Paige Stanley.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:03:29):**  Carl help me out.  Berkeley.  Jason Roundtree, Michigan State.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:03:32):**  Yep, there you go.  And that's a science.  The policy, the healthy soils legislation is becoming an important factor in all this  
**[0:03:45-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:03:45):**  now.  We have a page called policy.soilforclimate.org.  Soil for climate is all one word and the four is the number four.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:03:56):**  So the word soil, the number four, then climate.org.  And then if you put policy in front of that, you'll go to our page that has a database  with a map of all the policies, healthy soil policies at the state level.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:04:10):**  And then the practice is, of course, the practitioners that are actually doing it, making this stuff  happen on the ground.  And then our own branded project, a soil for climate branded project is with the Maasai  
**[0:04:27-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:04:27):**  group in Kenya.  And we're really excited about that.  And we've been doing funding for that.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:04:36):**  We've had them do holistic plan grazing training.  There is actually a savory hub in Kenya.  And so a group of them, Maasai have gone there.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:04:46):**  I went with them to the training once.  They've gone back again a second time.  We've helped them buy cows.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:04:54):**  We've helped them create a watering point.  We've helped them build a corral, all the logistics, the infrastructure of grazing.  So we're really excited about that.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:05:06):**  And there's a group now, there's a Maasai group in Tanzania, which is interested and  we're going to start a funding effort for them as well.  So there you have it.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:05:16):**  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  So, and I've kind of wondered this for a while, any specific reason why you chose the Maasai  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:05:23):**  tribe or was that just the way it happened?  It just, it's just the way it happened.  I mean, just through Facebook and LinkedIn or whatever.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:05:31):**  I don't even remember to be quite honest how we first made the contact, but a fellow there  named Dalmasty and Patty contacted me and we just hit it off and we became friends.  I'm now an official member of his community.  
**[0:05:49-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:05:49):**  I've been initiated into the Maasai via Maasai ritual.  That's amazing.  Which involved a sacrifice of a goat and drinking warm goat blood right there on the spot and  
**[0:06:06-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:06:06):**  eating some organ meat right there raw on the spot.  Not a big amount, sort of just symbolically having a little nibble, but nonetheless, that  was part of the ritual and it all just sort of happened and we're just sort of going with  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:06:22):**  the flow and it's exciting to see where it's going.  Seth, do you have your Maasai talking stick handy?  Oh, that's right.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:06:30):**  Well, you know what, when we do the video version of this, I'll hold the talking stick.  Our goal ultimately is for the Maasai project to serve as a model that could be replicated  through other Maasai communities and ultimately through large parts of Africa and elsewhere  
**[0:06:47-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:06:47):**  around the world that are facing desertification.  The savory hub that Seth mentioned is one of about 50 hubs established worldwide now  by the Savory Institute where people can receive training on how to do better grazing management  
**[0:07:02-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:02):**  and so forth.  Seth was just showing the talking stick that he's brought to any number of formal occasions.  Getting into the Massachusetts State House was a little bit of a challenge, but security  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:14):**  guards.  Yes, yes.  I had to say, well, technically it is a weapon.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:19):**  The pen is mightier than the sword.  But I use it symbolically as a talking stick.  The guard kind of grinned and said, all right, go on.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:32):**  We can see each other on video, but for the listeners on the podcast, tell us about your  stick.  What is it, about 18 inches and it's just a symbolic stick?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:40):**  What is it used for?  Well, honestly, I think it might have been a weapon traditionally, but now it's just  ritualistic.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:07:51):**  You just sort of hold it while you're talking.  So I refer to it as the talking stick and we just pass it along.  But to describe it to the listeners, it's a long thin piece of wood with a knob at the  
**[0:08:07-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:08:07):**  end so it could be conceived like a club.  However, it's very ornately decorated with beads and then there's beautiful little silver  dangling things.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:08:20):**  I'm not even sure what you call it, but it's meant to be ornamental at this point.  But sturdy enough if somebody's not listening while you're holding the talking stick, you  can bonk them on the head to get their attention.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:08:35):**  That's right.  You could carry a big stick.  So let's talk about some of the benefits of what you're doing and why we want to graze  
**[0:08:51-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:08:51):**  holistically and why we need to be worried about desertification.  Sure.  I'll back up a little bit here and say that soil for climate takes an ecumenical approach  
**[0:09:04-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:09:04):**  to soil restoration, that is we advocate for no-till, diversified cover crops, varied crop  rotations, compost, biochar, remineralization, agroforestry, silvopasture, any number of  different practices for putting carbon back into the ground.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:09:22):**  And to be clear, ultimately it's the plants that are transferring the carbon from the  atmosphere into the soil.  It used to be thought, and in many cases it's still taught, that it's plant litter or leaf  
**[0:09:35-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:09:35):**  litter decaying leaves essentially that fall into the ground and then as they break down  decay the carbon goes into the soil.  And that's true, some carbon gets into the soil that way, but what we now understand,  
**[0:09:47-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:09:47):**  and there's been really a profound shift in our knowledge of soil biology and plant physiology,  that most of the carbon gets into the ground through what are technically known as root  exudates, and what that is is that each type of plant makes a certain blend of sugar syrups  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:05):**  that whenever the sun is shining on the plant, the plant is producing the syrup and releasing  it into ground.  You can think of it in terms of maple sap.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:12):**  And it turns out each type of plant makes its own special blend that feeds a different  microbial community.  So the greater the diversity of plants above ground, the greater the diversity of life  
**[0:10:21-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:21):**  in the soil, and the more diverse the life is in the soil, the better the soil can express  so many different properties and become more resilient to drought, to build up carbon much  quicker in the soil and so forth.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:34):**  The reason that our focus has shifted, you know, largely I would say to the grazing side  is because of two reasons.  Number one, two-thirds of all land in agriculture in the United States and also worldwide are  
**[0:10:48-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:48):**  used for grazing.  So it's really the elephant in the room.  And number two, I would say the grazing side is least understood.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:10:58):**  And there's also a fair amount of antipathy or anti livestock sentiment right now, pushing  back against.  Trees are good, cows are bad.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:11:05):**  Well, this is something we hear all the time.  And the thing is, everybody knows that industrial animal agriculture can be quite harmful.  And to answer your question about desertification, you know, humans have been wrecking the environment,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:11:17):**  going back for thousands of years now through burning, deforestation, plowing and mismanaged  grazing.  And thankfully now, thanks to the work of, there's a French grazing scientist in 1950s,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:11:31):**  Andre Vossen, and later followed on by Alan Savory's work in the 1970s, we now understand  the importance of grazing in a nature-based way that keeps the animals clustered together,  linked every day or two, onto a new spot, and then enough time is allowed for the plants  
**[0:11:48-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:11:48):**  to fully recover before that same patch is grazed again.  And of course, you know, I know I'm preaching to the converted here because your company  exactly is designed to help grazers, ranchers, herders decide when and where to move the  
**[0:12:05-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:05):**  animals for the maximum beneficial impact for the productivity of the soil and for the  carrying capacity for the health of the animals, you know, and really for the well-being of  the community as a whole and for the environment.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:18):**  So I don't know, Seth, you want to add anything to that or?  No, no, you nailed it.  That was perfect.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:24):**  Thank you.  How did you guys meet, Carl and Seth?  I want to know that.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:31):**  Oh, at a parole meeting.  Oh, really?  I'm not surprised somehow.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:36):**  That's how Brian and I met too.  No, well, I'll tell you, it's just a little interesting background.  I actually don't remember how we met as adults.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:12:53):**  It's been a long time.  We've known each other for decades, but we found out after we already knew each other  as adults that as children, like 12 years old, we were both members of a youth program  
**[0:13:07-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:13:07):**  at the Museum of Science in Boston.  That's how little nerds we were.  And the Museum of Science had a youth program where they would train, you know, young kids  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:13:22):**  on a specific exhibit.  And then they would have you sort of stand around that exhibit and answer questions for  people.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:13:30):**  Oh, yeah.  This is at the Museum of Science.  And we found out later that we were both in that same program at the same time.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:13:37):**  We may very well have sort of like been in the training room at the time.  So that's just like another sort of tidbit of little information about him and I as sort  of, you know, you guys have been buddies for a long time.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:13:52):**  Since we were 12, but we didn't even know each other.  Carl, do you remember how we met later in life?  I remember volunteering at the Museum of Science when I was 15 and 16 years old.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:14:03):**  So I don't remember the 12-year-old part.  Yes, Seth and I were both fans of Buckminster Fuller.  And I mentioned him earlier, he was the inventor of the geodesic dome.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:14:17):**  And in the early 1990s, I was running an organization at Harvard called the Phylomorphs, which brought  together people interested in the subject of shape and design in nature and really understanding  nature through mathematics and art.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:14:33):**  It was a very eclectic organization.  And each month I would arrange different speakers.  And Seth was one of the attendees.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:14:39):**  It turned out both Seth and I had met, although he and I didn't know each other at the time.  We both met Buckminster Fuller when we were college students.  And both were sort of taken in and fell under the spell of Fuller's vision, the notion that  
**[0:14:54-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:14:54):**  humanity could be a success, could succeed on the planet without destroying the environment,  meeting everybody's needs.  And it was just a very hopeful, technophile sort of driven view.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:15:07):**  And over the years, as Seth and I, as we became friends, we were both interested in climate  activism and studying about climate change.  And eventually through our work, we began to understand that while it's crucial to cut  
**[0:15:23-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:15:23):**  emissions, that doesn't solve the problem.  We still have to deal with this legacy carbon in the atmosphere.  And even while you're cutting emissions, it does nothing to heal the habitat where the  
**[0:15:34-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:15:34):**  wildlife are going extinct or to replenish these dried up rivers or meet other human  needs and environmental needs.  And what we did learn was that soil restoration addressed all of these issues.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:15:47):**  It got the carbon out of the sky, but it also restored the wildlife habitat and also provided  high quality, better, more nutritious food for people.  So it just, I think we were both taken in by this all encompassing solution.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:16:00):**  And we began to see that not only do we need the technology, but we also need, in essence,  nature's technology, that nature has been evolving for millions, tens of millions, hundreds  of millions of years.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:16:13):**  And it's worth pointing out that Alan Savory, the grazing pioneer back in, I believe it  was 2010, won the Buckminster Fuller Challenge Award for being a person who recognized a  pattern in nature and was able to apply it for the benefit of humanity.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:16:32):**  I think I remember that.  But at the time, it was real hard to get anybody to care about who Alan Savory was.  That's changed.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:16:42):**  That was before the TED Talk.  Exactly.  So Brian, can I jump in here with more on the Bucky stuff?  
**[0:16:51-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:16:51):**  Yeah, I'm sort of glad that Carl just reminded me.  Yeah, I mean, that was, we were really colleagues for a long time around Buckminster Fuller,  like long before we were into Alan Savory.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:17:05):**  And in some ways, Alan Savory sort of, I mean, Buckminster Fuller had already passed, and  so it was sort of a historical appreciation of him.  But Alan Savory was alive.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:17:21):**  And it's like, this is the thing.  We need to be working on this now.  And I think we both realized that in many ways, Alan Savory was like the new Buckminster  
**[0:17:35-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:17:35):**  Fuller.  And working with living systems, and Buckminster Fuller had this idea of trim tab.  Well, it wasn't his idea.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:17:49):**  I mean, the trim tab is a nautical concept and an aeronautic concept.  But Buckminster Fuller adopted that as his metaphor for life.  And just for you or for the listeners, the trim tab is technically originated from nautical  
**[0:18:08-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:18:08):**  terms.  It's the end of the tiller.  It's like the tiny little tiller at the end of a bigger tiller.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:18:17):**  And then on the plane, on the wing, you'll see it.  It's like a tiny little wing on the end of the bigger wing.  And the way it works literally is it creates a low pressure system, which then pulls the  
**[0:18:32-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:18:32):**  rest of the tiller or the wing in that direction.  And whereas if you were to try to push a boat from the front, it would be almost impossible.  But with a little piece of metal or cardboard, you can steer it from the back.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:18:51):**  And Buckminster Fuller's metaphor was that where to intervene in the system, where the  least amount of pressure can move an entire system.  And the system is symbolic of any system, a political system, a design sciences.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:19:07):**  Where to make the least effort to move the whole thing.  And so trim tab became his metaphor.  And he used to say, call me trim tab.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:19:16):**  And Carl and I have visited his tombstone at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  And on the tombstone, it says, call me trim tab.  And we see the holistic grazing is like that trim tab.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:19:34):**  Where just to intervene in the system that can change, profoundly change the outcome,  just grazing management, same animals, same people, same land, just change the management  slightly and have profoundly different outcomes.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:19:49):**  So actually, I'm glad we're having the bucky discussion because it's actually reminding  me of the initial, what's the word, spirit of direction for us of how we got into this.  And now we're so eyeballed deep into it, into the grazing and all that, I've even forgotten  
**[0:20:11-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:20:11):**  that it actually came from a completely non-grazing sort of inspiration of how to behave in the  world, how to make a difference in the world.  And now what's interesting is that Alan has the term of marginal reaction.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:20:29):**  And if you read Alan's work, he talks about the various steps of holistic management.  And the last one is where, I don't know whether it's the last one, but one of the last ones  he talks about the marginal reaction.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:20:38):**  He says, where's the point where I forget the exact definition of it, but for all practical  purposes, it's sort of like that trim tab thing.  Where's the point where the least effort now can make the biggest difference.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:20:54):**  Carl, do you want to add a little something about the savory's marginal reaction?  There's a term in systems dynamics that's also related to where you want to apply the  least amount of pressure in order for the whole system to respond.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:21:17):**  And I'm sorry, I'm blanking on the term right now.  I'll try to find it as we're continuing the discussion.  I do want to mention it's probably no coincidence that at least three of our advisory board  
**[0:21:28-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:21:28):**  members had some relationship with Buckland Stafuller as well and were inspired by his  work going back.  Amy Edmondson, who's now a tenured professor at Harvard Business School, as an undergraduate  
**[0:21:41-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:21:41):**  at Harvard, she kind of fell under Bucky's spell and ended up working with Fuller the  last two years of his life and then writing a book about his work.  Hunter Lovins, whom some of you may know out in Colorado, she was co-author of the book  
**[0:21:53-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:21:53):**  Natural Capitalism and recently wrote A Finer Future.  And Hunter is a rancher but also a visionary and she was inspired early on by Buckland  Stafuller's work.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:22:06):**  And also Greg Watson, who served as the commissioner of agriculture in Massachusetts under several  administrations.  And Greg, as a graduate student, I believe, worked at a facility in Woods Hole, Massachusetts  
**[0:22:21-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:22:21):**  called the New Alchemy Institute, which was back in the 1960s started by a group of visionary  scientists committed to finding technologies and biologies for a post-carbon world.  So they were very much ahead of the curve.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:22:36):**  John Todd and his wife Nancy Jack Todd headed up that group.  And Greg Watson had the opportunity to meet Buckland Stafuller, as did both Seth and I  as well.  
**[0:22:46-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:22:46):**  So his legacy is very much alive and well and continuing to spread throughout the world  as we see more and more that we are able to have profoundly positive effects on nature.  And historically, and this dates back to Man and Nature, a book from 1863 by George Perkins  
**[0:23:11-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:23:11):**  George Marsh Perkins, I think his name was, who basically described anytime humans affected  with the environment, the effect was negative.  And we understand now that that's not necessarily the case.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:23:27):**  Anytime you hear about environmental impact, the assumption is that it's harmful to the  land.  And we understand now that in fact more land needs to be impacted.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:23:36):**  There's a whole divide within the agricultural community of land sharing versus land sparing.  There's one approach that says, oh, we have to intensify nature so it's taken up less  land.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:23:49):**  And then there's the other approach that says, no, in fact, so much of the land around the  world has been harmed and degraded that we need to impact that land, but in a beneficial  way.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:23:58):**  And this ties into the discussion about meat.  We often hear eat less meat.  We have to reduce our meat consumption.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:06):**  And Seth and I look at that and we say, what are you talking about?  You know, there's billions of acres of land that have to be healed and grazing is the  only appropriate activity.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:14):**  There's not enough wild animals left.  So we need to use livestock to do the job.  We don't need more fake meat.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:19):**  We need more cows.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:22):**  It's a type of meat.  They're talking about grain finished.  I'll let Seth address the whole fake meat issue if you want to.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:32):**  He's very passionate about it.  I follow you, Seth, and I'm like, you say things that I wish I could say, but I don't.  Well, I'm technically like retired, so you know, I don't care anymore.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:48):**  You don't have to worry about somebody taking away your paycheck.  Yeah, I can say what I think.  Yep.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:24:54):**  There you go.  So that's something that's kind of on everybody's mind lately is, you know, fake meat and the  pressure of fake meat, especially with, I hate to say his name, but Bill Gates in his  
**[0:25:07-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:25:07):**  last book about, you know, how he thinks we need to eat and him saying that rich nations  should eat fake meat.  And to me, that is the most absurd, asinine possible thing that anybody could say, because  
**[0:25:22-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:25:22):**  in order to make that fake meat, it requires a fantastic amount of energy, a lot of monoculture  farming that leads to soil erosion, herbicide, pesticide use, and then all that stuff has  to be processed.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:25:36):**  And then you're going to put it in the lab and synthesize it back into a patty that,  quote, bleeds.  No, I'll take mine from a cow.  
**[0:25:48-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:25:48):**  Thanks.  It just doesn't make sense to me that you can invest that much energy and technology  into something that you're going to eat when we can do that with sunshine and grass.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, well, it's obviously horrifying.  I mean, it's a profound misdirection of logic and of understanding of how ecosystems work.  And it has no concept, of course, of restoration.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:26:23):**  It has no idea about restoration ecology.  And it's a technological, I don't even think it's a sincere technological attempt at fixing  the problem of industrial meat.  
**[0:26:47-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:26:47):**  And the whole idea that you're going to fix one industrial problem with another industrial  problem is itself sort of absurd.  Why not just change how we produce meat?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:27:01):**  Why not just produce meat in a way that's ecologically responsible?  And so now, because they know that people are becoming hip to that, that the problem  is not the cow, it's the how, right?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:27:16):**  That phrase, it's not the cow, it's the how.  Give a shout out to Wisconsin of blue nest beef coming up with that phrase.  Now that they know that people are becoming hip to that, they're actually attacking regenerative  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:27:31):**  agriculture.  So imposter foods, that's how I'm going to refer to them.  Suits me just fine.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:27:40):**  Yes.  And then the other thing about foods is, and glyphosate burger.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:49-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:27:49):**  They're attacking regenerative agriculture.  What else do you need to know than that?  Even if regenerative, even if all of the claims about regenerative agriculture weren't true,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:02):**  even if just 10% of them were true, wouldn't that still be headline news?  Wouldn't you still be running full force?  Because it's a disruptor.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:12):**  That's why they don't want it.  It's disruptive and it threatens every single established industry almost.  I mean.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:20):**  Yeah.  Of course.  Is that why PepsiCo is doing what they're doing then?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:24):**  They're trying to greenwash Regen Ag?  Well, but the thing is, now there's going to be some sincere effort.  Right.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:35):**  So if they can actually grow sugar cane or whatever in a way that is regenerative, why  not?  Good.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:28:45):**  See, same thing with McDonald's.  McDonald's is now funding some of the research in regenerative agriculture.  And well, why not?

**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:00):**  Now, if there's a certain amount of greenwashing that's going on in their corporate headquarters,  well, so what?  You know, I mean, the point is the research is the research.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:07):**  And if there's going to be Regen producers producing meat in a regenerative way, fine.  You know, let them put their spin on it.  But the point is the problem for imposter foods is that they're now hooked on soy.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:23):**  It has to be soy.  Right.  And all of the soy is at scale, the soy that's produced at scale.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:34):**  It's all Roundup ready soy.  It's all sprayed with glyphosate.  The glyphosate is going into the water.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:39):**  It's causing cancer.  Monsanto is being sued up the Yazoo with these landmark settlements in the billions of dollars.  So imposter foods is stuck.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:29:52):**  You know, their whole marketing paradigm is based on vilifying meat, necessarily meat.  And so the idea that there could be a healthy meat or regenerative meat is just a profound  threat to their entire marketing scheme.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:11):**  And if you follow me on LinkedIn and CK knows this, you know, we're going toe to toe with  them.  Yes, he sure is.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:21):**  That's what I'm going to call it.  I'm going to have to get on LinkedIn and check that out.  You know, and to my amazement, they haven't kicked.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:27):**  They haven't bought me yet.  Now on Twitter, they have.  So I'm blocked from their Twitter feed, but you can grab my stuff and you can post it  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:35):**  to their Twitter page.  But on LinkedIn, they made the mistake of going toe to toe with me.  They thought they were going to dismiss me.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:42):**  Well, that hasn't worked.  And I'm happy to say that a lot of our Facebook, you know, friends, Sarah Keough, John Rulack,  Carl, others are on their LinkedIn.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:30:57):**  LinkedIn, yes, on their LinkedIn page and are pushing back on them pretty strong.  And to be honest, it's fun.  You know, I think we need that.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:09):**  We have to be able to push back.  That's the only way you get people to pay attention to.  Like it's sad, but it's true.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:16):**  People are not going to pay attention if you're just nice.  Right.  And you know, LinkedIn has a different sort of.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:22):**  Yeah, it's like business.  And someone even responded on their LinkedIn page about me.  They said, oh, he's confusing LinkedIn for Facebook.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:32):**  No, you just don't have a boss to worry about.  I'm well aware of where I am.  Well, guys, I really hate to cut this short because it's such a great conversation.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:45):**  But Seth, we're going to have you back real soon to continue this conversation and expand  on a lot of these subjects.  So we have a few minutes.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:31:53):**  Is there anything we left on the table real quick, Carl or Seth that you guys want to  get out?  I'd just like to follow up on this discussion about the whole fake meat issue.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:32:04):**  It's part of a larger fallacy of the climate movement, which is this notion that by doing  less farm, we can solve the issue.  And that's not good enough.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:32:13):**  It's not good enough to use a little less water or to use a little less fossil fuels  and so on.  We need to go beyond that and really begin doing good instead.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:32:22):**  And we need to cut fossil fuels, of course, there's no question.  But we need to take it far beyond that.  And agriculture has the leading role to play.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:32:34):**  Every industry needs to do its part.  Electric vehicles, they're great.  Riding a bicycle instead of taking a car, that's great.  
**[0:32:44-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:32:44):**  Walk if you can, whatever.  And every acre of land around the world that's managed by humans can be in service to humanity.  There's great research now showing that each acre can be pulling out roughly a ton of carbon  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:33:00):**  per year.  And with billions of acres of land around the world to work with, that's how we can  be removing billions of tons of carbon from the air.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:33:08):**  And that's the scale that we need to be thinking at.  And it also rejuvenates communities.  It provides jobs for people.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:33:15):**  It helps to address these nutritional deficiencies that we see in children and adults all over  the world.  So it's a very broad solution that's available everywhere.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:33:26):**  Anyone can do it in their backyards, any scale of farming.  And that's really what we need to be pushing forward and working towards.  Yeah, and I'll just concur with that.  
**[0:33:41-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:33:41):**  The number one fallacy is that it's good enough to do less harm.  And so the two main sort of marketing tenants of like imposter foods and other things like  that is one, that meat is bad, and two, that well, we do less harm.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:02):**  And neither of those things are true.  Meat isn't bad, and it's not OK to do less harm.  You have to actually do good.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:08):**  You have to produce protein in a way that sequesters carbon.  Yes, exactly.  Bang.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:16):**  And there's one way to do that.  There's only one way to do that.  And that's with regenerative grazing.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:22):**  Now, now, Gabe Brown and others also do a crop rotation.  So he does soy as a cash crop.  OK.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:33):**  And that's because in his context, it makes sense to do so.  But the second he starts getting paid for his soil carbon drawdown, it's not going to  be worth it to do this.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:44):**  Soy is a cash crop anymore.  Eventually there will be a trade off.  Annuals don't sequester carbon.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:34:55):**  You know, so there's the other part of this.  There's the other leg, if you will, is the price on soil carbon.  And as soon as there's a price on soil carbon, and that's another thing that the fake meat  
**[0:35:07-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:07):**  people are going to push against.  As soon as there's a price on soil carbon and as soon as in the next farm bill, which  is what's going to happen, they're going to change the whole subsidy program.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:22):**  People are going to be like, why grow soy?  You know, let's just start grazing.  It's going to be a whole new world.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:29):**  And I hope people are ready to adapt in a big hurry because if they don't, they're going  to go the way of Kodak.  That makes me excited though, because we're going to do it.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:39):**  We're going to do it.  Yes.  The bus.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:42):**  I would add it's ironic that at the same time Bill Gates is saying eat less.  I know.  You'll need Microsoft just purchased carbon credits from a holistic grazing operation.  
**[0:35:50-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:35:50):**  Well, he definitely confuses me.  The farm ground that he bought, the 242,000 acres of farm ground that he bought last year,  he didn't even know he did that.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:01):**  Like he was on the internet a couple of weeks ago because he got questioned about it.  He's like, oh, I didn't even know that happened.  My people did that because we want to control the seeds.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:11):**  I'm like, oh, that makes it better.  And it has nothing to do with climate.  It has nothing to do with climate, but that guy, he's going to have a wake up call one  
**[0:36:18-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:18):**  of these days about the ecological effects of his farming.  And I would allege that Bill Gates is the world's largest single polluter because…  He buys offsets.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:33):**  He buys offsets.  Well, not only does he buy offsets, I mean, he flies around Gulfstream whatever that burns  500 gallons an hour.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:41):**  But no, the farm ground that he owns, all the soil erosion, all the pesticide, herbicide  run off, he's the world's largest polluter in my mind.  There's so much good he could do.  
**[0:36:50-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:36:50):**  Like I wish he saw that potential of actually the good.  He's almost a Lex Luthor figure these days.  The best thing he can do right now is to shut up.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:37:03):**  I can't disagree.  And guys, I think we've got to end there.  Thank you so much for your time today.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:37:09):**  And we really appreciate it, Seth and Carl.  Thanks for joining us.  Okay, our pleasure.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-6-with-Karl-T-and-Seth-I-Soil4Climate-e127ts2#t=0:37:14):**  Take care.

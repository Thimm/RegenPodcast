We have Hobbs Magaray with us with Sisters Cattle Company joining Brian Alexander, the  Red Hills Rancher and then me, TK, your favorite host.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:00:43):**  We're just gonna be, we're gonna be talking about what he's been doing.  Alright, so Hobbs, tell me your story.  Tell us your story.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:00:54):**  Tell us about your history and your education.  Well, I grew up in the Texas panhandle in the commercial cattle world.  My granddad managed big ranches.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:01:07):**  And although my parents were no longer working in the industry, I spent much of my youth  with him.  And so he managed, he managed big ranches.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:01:19):**  When I was born, he was managing 70,000 acre ranch in Northeast New Mexico.  He managed several 16, 20, 25,000 acre ranches outside of Vega, Texas.  And towards the end of his life, he was in the, in the, the Crowell, Texas area between,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:01:40):**  you know, around kind of around Wichita Falls.  And so basically, he was, he was kind of my idol.  His, his last name was Hobbs.  
**[0:01:48-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:01:48):**  And so that's why I got Hobbs as a first name.  So you know, in, in, I didn't have the choice, really, I was sort of cast into that role  by, you know, by my name selection and just sort of the circumstances of my birth and  
**[0:02:04-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:02:04):**  had a pretty normal upbringing we had, you know, my parents had a couple of hundred acres  outside of Canyon, Texas.  And so, outside of spending a lot of time with my granddad, you know, we were always  
**[0:02:16-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:02:16):**  surrounded by cattle and ranches and that that culture and, and then graduated high  school at Amarillo High School in 2005, and then went to the University of Oregon because  my parents were my, you know, my dad, it was as much older than my mom and was nearing  
**[0:02:33-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:02:33):**  sort of retirement age.  So they decided they wanted to retire in the Pacific Northwest.  So I went to the University of Oregon and was thrust from the, the ranches of the extremely  
**[0:02:48-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:02:48):**  conservative ranches of the Texas Panhandle immediately into a parade of lesbians and  hippies within, you know, within a few days of each other.  So it's been it's been a varied experience.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:03:05):**  I graduated college in 2009.  You know, every summer I'd go back to work on the ranches.  My granddad had died at that point, but I would go back and learn from and work for  
**[0:03:15-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:03:15):**  the people that he taught and he that he worked with and for.  And then so then in 2009, graduated and worked as a musician, composer and sometime airport  manager for about five, six years.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:03:38):**  And because, you know, my granddad always said that there's no retirement ranching.  So I so I took that right, that I should, you know, do something else.  And so I studied music in college, I actually got a degree in political science.  
**[0:03:49-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:03:49):**  But but I studied music in college and was really serious about it for a long time.  I scored a lot of ended up scoring some really cool stuff.  I, you know, I wrote and recorded and I scored the intro to Wimbledon, the Australian Open,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:05):**  the French Open, a bunch of video game stuff.  Yeah.  Wow, that's cool.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:09):**  Yeah.  So I was I was fairly moderately successful composer for a little little bit.  And then somewhere around 2016 2017, that all kind of fell apart.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:21):**  And you're not really sure why.  But in the span of about a week, we, my business sort of just fell off a cliff.  We got evicted from our house because the landlord had not had not been aware that we  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:36):**  it was not actually zoned for occupancy.  So the county found out, you know, we we didn't know this and the county's like, you have  to leave.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:44):**  It's like, okay, and that and then and then we found out we were pregnant all like in  this in this span.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:49):**  Yeah.  So where were you at this time?  Where did that happen?  
**[0:04:53-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:04:53):**  In sisters, we were in sisters, Oregon at that time.  And then so we so we took tail and went to Los Angeles in search of some form of monetary  stability.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:05:04):**  And my wife got a great job with a company called mute six.  That's sort of one of the leading digital marketing agencies on the planet right now.  She's like employee number 30 something and now they're over 300.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:05:16):**  So we really lucked out on our timing there.  And while I was doing the whole stay at home dad thing because she had found sort of some  success and I was you know, you know, bringing coal to Newcastle by trying to be a musician  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:05:30):**  in LA.  So logically, you know, I was not having a whole lot of success.  So I was being a stay at home dad and, you know, so it's like God, I having come from  
**[0:05:38-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:05:38):**  where I came from, it's like really, well, what else am I going to do other than you  know, give try to give my child the same upbringing that I had.  So it was time, time to try to find some some ranch jobs.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:05:50):**  And you know, through all these interviews, started learning about regenerative agriculture,  everybody's guru, everybody's book, everybody's way of looking at things and, you know, sort  of began to crystallize in my mind, this new way of ranching that ought to be done.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:05):**  And it turns out there are not that many jobs out there for that.  So we decided to take another leap of faith, come back up to sisters and start our own  cattle company.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:16):**  And here we are.  So why sisters?  If you can go anywhere in the world, why sisters?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:23):**  What do you love about it?  Well, a couple of reasons.  Number one, we had my parents are up here.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:29):**  And so we have some support with the kiddo.  You know, one, one, two and three year old children are, you know, turn you into a homicidal,  barely functioning human.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:43):**  So having parents around to help is amazingly helpful.  And you know, I recognize that sisters, there was there was a business opportunity that  that I would find have difficulty finding elsewhere, which is namely, rich people buying  
**[0:06:57-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:06:57):**  up small pieces of agricultural land with no motivation to do anything with it.  So I realized that I could come back here and tie a bunch of small pieces of string  together to make one large piece of string.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:07:11):**  And effectively, these people just want to keep their tax credits and their tax deferrals.  So they're like, hey, you know, you just run some cattle out here, do something with it,  prove that we're using it for ag purposes, we'll show enough income to, you know, make  
**[0:07:27-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:07:27):**  it legit and do your thing.  And so that's what I've been doing for for three years now.  I've, I started with the only thing I had guaranteed was seven acres of dirt lot when  
**[0:07:40-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:07:40):**  I came up here and a little bit of startup money, but we've been able to, through primarily  through relationship building, right, you know, just expand to a couple hundred acres  and you know, as many cattle as we can fit on it.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:07:56):**  That's that's one of the things I really want to get into Hobbs.  For those who are listeners that don't know, I met Hobbs on social media, specifically  TikTok, and Hobbs, some of your content on there has just been terrific about how to  
**[0:08:12-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:08:12):**  get started and how to acquire resources and how to really bootstrap yourself up from basically  nothing in this industry.  You want to talk about that?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:08:26):**  Sure.  Obviously nobody really bootstraps from nothing.  You have to have a little bit of something and in this case, I mean, take it with a grain  
**[0:08:36-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:08:36):**  of salt that, you know, my wife is able to provide some sort of income for us and while  we've been building this business and you know, I live in an area where, you know, I  judiciously chose this area for that particular purpose.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:08:52):**  So you know, you have to apply it to your own situation, but the fundamental premise  that I think can allow you to succeed no matter where you are, no matter where you're starting  from is if you fundamentally realize that nobody gives a shit about you and if you can  
**[0:09:07-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:09:07):**  really take that to heart, then you can understand that the only way to get what you want is  to give other people what they want and in this case, I didn't go to anybody and say,  hey, can I graze your land?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:09:22):**  I went to people and I said, well, actually what I started with were a couple of things.  You know, the first guy, the first 60 acres I was able to acquire, he had turned down  a few people who wanted to graze his land and I went and talked to him and he said,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:09:39):**  you know, the only way that would let you graze the land is if you do it in this very  specific way and I'm like, oh, okay, well, I'm going to be moving my cattle, you know,  between once and four times a day.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:09:47):**  He's like, okay, well, we're on the same page then.  So he was kind of a permaculture guy from Connecticut and so he was very interested  in this thing.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:09:58):**  So we hit it off right away.  And then so effectively, number one, I gave him what he wanted.  So I was able to get it and then number two, I started very, you know, I created a spectacle,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:10:11):**  you have to create a spectacle.  Everybody wants to just get land and throw cows out there and then go gather them up  and then profit, you know, right?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:10:18):**  But if you do something that's so far off of the norm, people will take notice.  They will start to go, oh, this is very interesting.  And so when I'm out there with all this silly string polywire, moving these cattle bunched  
**[0:10:33-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:10:33):**  up, you know, two to four times a day, people are like, well, what the heck's going on there?  And you know, the second piece of land I got was this total piece of garbage land and,  but it was right next to the highway.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:10:47):**  So you know, I had, you know, 10,000 eyeballs on my cattle every day.  And so I was very conspicuously grazing in a way that was very confusing to people.  So, if you find a way to give people what they want, and also do it in a way that's  
**[0:11:04-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:04):**  sort of unusual, and you make the case that you're doing something that's more than just  about beef, you're about, you're doing it about, you're doing it for first and foremost  for, Brian, as you like to say, an ecosystem services, service business, and then beef  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:21):**  as a side product, then people...  I can't, you can't, I can't, you can't quote me on that, because I actually stole that  one from my dad.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:29):**  It's ecological goods and services.  Oh, yeah, well, excellent.  Well, let's say it's an Alexander quote, then.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:36):**  There you go.  Yeah.  But, but that, I mean, but that's exactly right.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:40):**  Right.  I mean, we have this amazingly extractive view, instead of leading ourselves as ecological  engineers.  
**[0:11:47-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:11:47):**  And, and if you could, in terms of bootstrapping, if you can present yourself as an ecological  engineer, and not just a rancher, and if you can, and by way of doing that, you do it in  this way that's unusual and really cool.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:00):**  Everybody wants to be involved with something that's cool.  Okay.  Everybody likes cool stuff.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:05):**  And so if you can save people money on their taxes, and you're involved with something  that they can talk to their friends about and post on social media, and they can see  an improvement in their pasture, and they don't have to do anything, they just have  
**[0:12:18-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:18):**  to sit out there and look at it, then, then, then that's great.  But I mean, that's what, what you're not going to succeed at is, is, hey, can I, can I graze  your land?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:29):**  Because that's immediately an extractive proposition, right?  Can I have something from you?  And can I have something from you, and I'll just pay you X dollars an acre a year?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:39):**  Right.  There's, there's, there's nothing, nothing is sexy about that.  And nothing is romantic about that.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:44):**  It doesn't pique people's interest.  And so if you're going, I mean, and this is why I've made so many posts, probably two  or three on TikTok about the book, How to Win Friends and Influence People.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:12:55):**  Because it's, it's all about this notion.  It's that nobody cares about you.  And that's not a bad thing.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:00):**  Like, like, one of the, one of the quotes in the book is people care about a lump on  their, you know, like, people care about their sore throat more than they do a famine in  China, right?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:11):**  So, so, I mean, what now?  Sad but true.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:19):**  And so, you know, you have to play to people's desire.  I mean, we're all vain emotional creatures.  And if you play to that, and when I say play, I don't mean manipulate, I mean, just recognize  
**[0:13:28-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:28):**  that that's just the way it is.  And, and formulate your approach towards people for that.  And you basically just end up with kind of this like, you know, selfless regard.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:41):**  It's like, you know, the only way that I can get what I want is if I give what you, what  you want.  And that's actually self interest over the long term.  
**[0:13:49-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:13:49):**  So this is fundamentally self interested, but self interest over a long timescale is,  is interest in others.  And so if you can form, if you can formulate a way to give as many people as they want,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:14:04):**  what they want over the longest period of time that you can, then you will win, you  know, you will have people coming to you.  I, somebody like I got a call the other day for say, hey, I just saw your, I found an  
**[0:14:14-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:14:14):**  article about you in the paper, or I saw your stuff on TikTok, would you be interested in  grazing my, you know, five acres?  And it's like, it was a little too far away to justify the cost and, you know, but, but  
**[0:14:25-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:14:25):**  still, you know, people, how many, how many ranchers have people calling them asking,  hey, can you graze my land?  I wish I had those calls.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:14:34):**  Yeah, just isn't much coming up for release around here.  A lot of it's big tracks, but totally get what you're saying.  Yeah, I mean, it's that, I mean, I was certainly recommend, one of the, sometimes when people  
**[0:14:49-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:14:49):**  ask, you know, what's the best ranching book you would recommend?  I think the most fundamental ranching book that would benefit everybody's had, When Friends  and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, because it's just all about human nature.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:01):**  And we ranchers are just as vain and emotional as anybody else.  And all landowners are.  And if you can find a way to, yeah, just, just get the book and read it and read it  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:12):**  with a highlighter.  I mean, that's really what I'm going to do.  And then I went, you know, I go back through it occasionally, I'll just look at the highlighted  
**[0:15:19-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:19):**  sections and go, okay, well, I can think, you know, I look, I'll open the book to any  random place, and I'll immediately find something that I screwed up on that week by putting  my, you know, my own interests ahead of somebody else's and how it cost me, you know, so it's  
**[0:15:32-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:32):**  just a constant reminder.  So it's like, you just have to, you, you have to, you know, you have to be out there, you  have to, you have to be in the community, you have to network and you have to learn  
**[0:15:43-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:43):**  to network.  And if you write a network, that's the only way you're going to build a community and  build a brand is by networking, like there's a, and I mentioned it just in passing that  
**[0:15:53-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:15:53):**  I worked in an airport.  And what that actually was, was a, it was an engineering firm that had bought the small  local airport because you know, the owner was a pilot.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:07):**  And so he bought the local airport and you know, he actually hired me to write these  grants because I had a degree in political science.  So I wrote these grants and I, I over, over four years, I pulled in like $1.3 million  
**[0:16:19-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:19):**  to rebuild this airport.  And you know, learning from him and studying under him was just like this unbelievable  master's level course in business.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:29):**  And he was like, he, he, he had all these really great phrases.  And one of them was if you, if you want to grow, you've got to go.  And I think that's, I think that's really valuable with regard to networking and calling  
**[0:16:40-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:40):**  people and being involved.  And, you know, you gotta, you gotta be out there in the community.  And I think particularly there's a, there's a strain of rancher that loves to just sort  
**[0:16:49-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:49):**  of, I'm just going to go back on the ranch.  And the only time I want to see people is when I take my cattle to market or when I  go into drink coffee on the mornings, like the, you know, that's the only time I want  
**[0:16:59-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:16:59):**  to see people.  And so, so they really deprive themselves of the networking necessity that is becoming  increasingly important as the population grows around these ranches.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:17:13):**  You know, it's like, you know, another guy, my, you know, my mentor there in post Oregon,  he's, he's, he's like, you know, we're the Indians now.  It's that same kind of thing that, you know, they talk about that Yellowstone as well,  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:17:24):**  right?  It's like, right.  And we're out on these, we're basically out on these reservations.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:17:30):**  And if you don't go out and interact with the, the population that is surrounding us,  like it's going to subsume us.  And you know, you have to turn that into your own benefit.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:17:41):**  So with regard to bootstrapping, like network, do things that other people are not doing,  be willing to put in the work that other people are not willing to do.  Like, you know, you wouldn't, you would be amazed at how many times I get the comment,  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:17:54):**  you know, who has time to move their cattle four times a day.  And it's like, I'm not just moving them just because I like to move them.  Like, I do love to move my cattle.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:18:01):**  It's like, there are huge advantages that come from that.  And number one, number one is I'm this crazy dude out there moving my cattle four times  a day, like that gets people's attention, you know, and, and I've, and I've reaped a  
**[0:18:12-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:18:12):**  lot of benefits from that.  And so network, do unusual, go as hard as you can as hard as you possibly can with regard  to regenerative, be on the cutting edge.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:18:24):**  I mean, it's like, this is the thing that another thing that, okay, here's another thing.  But with regard to bootstrapping yourself, and this is, I'll tell a story here.  My, you know, when my mother was a little girl, my granddad was managing the Green Ranch  
**[0:18:40-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:18:40):**  outside of Vega, Texas, and they lived out on the camp.  And, you know, they had the barn and the horses and the house and all that.  And, you know, my mom got into this phase where she was asking him, hey, Dad, teach  
**[0:18:52-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:18:52):**  me how to rope horseback, teach me how to rope horseback.  And he'd be like, no, you know, I'm not going to do that.  She wouldn't give it up like week later, Dad, teach me how to rope horseback, teach me how  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:01):**  to rope horseback.  Like, oh, no, I'm not going to do that.  And then, you know, another week later, she said, Dad, teach me how to rope horseback.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:08):**  And he looked at her and he said, Nancy, if you'd wanted to do it bad enough, you'd already  done it.  And I think that that's an extremely valuable thing with, you know, people are, people ask  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:18):**  me on TikTok all the time, like, what's a good source for regenerative agriculture?  It's like, do you not have Google?  Do you not have YouTube?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:26):**  Yeah, like, just go down the rabbit hole.  Jesus Christ.  Google search the hashtag.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:33):**  It's yeah, there's just page after page after page.  Yeah, I mean, that's the fact that nobody's going to hand it to you.  I mean, people have heard this their whole life.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:43):**  Nobody's going to hand it to you.  But if you take action and do the work, doors will open.  I mean, that's the bottom line.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:49):**  And you may have to you may have to sacrifice a lot of stuff like I'll tell you for I'll tell you  straight up what I had to sacrifice.  Like I used to play guitar four to five hours a day.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:19:59):**  Like I wanted to be like, I could play the shit out of the guitar.  And I was much of my life was revolved around that.  But I sacrificed it.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:20:08):**  And I don't pick up the guitar much at all anymore because I wanted to do regenerative agriculture so bad that I sacrificed that because that was the number one thing getting in my way as much as I loved it.  And as important as it was to me, it was the very thing that prevented me from succeeding.  So I had to, you know, I had to sacrifice it at the altar of the greater good, you know that.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:20:27):**  And I also had to stop smoking weed, you know, going to go into school at the at the University of Oregon.  It was everywhere.  And I got into a thing where I was smoking a lot of weed.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:20:38):**  And, you know, not to say I don't partake occasionally, which is OK, all things in moderation.  But I was smoking a lot of weed and I really had to say, you know, like, all right, if if you could.  If you were guaranteed to succeed, if you stop smoking weed so much, would you do it?  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:20:56):**  Well, of course.  Well, then do it, you know.  So that's that's that's one thing that those those are two big sacrifices that I had to make.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:05):**  And so, you know, you won't get where you want to go without giving up the things that you already have and the things that are most precious to you.  I mean, what's there's a I can't remember the characters in the Bible where it was like Isaac or something who had to go, you know, take his son up on the on the mountain.  And sacrifice it.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:23):**  Yeah, Abraham.  Yeah, Abraham and his son, Isaac.  Yeah, right.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:28):**  Abraham and Isaac.  And at the last moment, God was like, no, you don't really need to do that, but you have to be willing to do it.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:35):**  Willing to sacrifice that is most precious to you in order to serve the greater good.  And, you know, that's largely so.  I mean, with bootstrapping, like you got to sacrifice, you got to network and you got to push the regenerative edge as hard as you can.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:50):**  Because there is nothing special about throwing cattle out in the pasture and then gathering them once they've eaten all the forage.  Like there's nothing special about that.  Nobody cares.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:21:59):**  It's not interesting.  It's not sexy.  It's not romantic.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:22:03):**  And also, you know, that's that is it's and you're playing right into the whole it's bad for the environment thing because, you know, it kind of is degrading pastures.  So I hope that answers your question, Brian.  Oh, that was that was a little bit.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:22:18):**  Yeah.  Let's talk about some of the some of the new and innovative practices that you're implementing outside of mainstream.  Well, certainly, I don't know how new and innovative they are, I think, you know, everything that I do is an amalgamation of what I've learned from other people.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:22:36):**  And I just, you know, learn my own little twists on it, how I applied it to my to my particular circumstances.  You know, I suppose you're right. You know, the kind of grazing that that I do and the kind of grazing that you do, it's not really necessarily new.  It might be kind of new to us or new in our areas.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:22:57):**  But these techniques, they've been around for for a long time, haven't they?  They yeah, I mean, as far as I can tell, they've been along around a long time, but now we have I mean, I don't know how when did Polywire become, you know, like a thing?  Because that was really the game.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:23:12):**  Yes, I think it was a Joel Salatin says now with the invention.  The Polywire, we can put a gas, a brake and a steering wheel on that bovine.  That's that's that's that's well said, you know, and that's and Ziesman said, you know, Ziesman says, you know, now we have control of how of, you know, mouths and hooves with, you know, like we've never had before.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:23:34):**  Obviously, Joel Salatin being the unbelievable marketer and and the loquacious character that he is put puts it way better.  But but yeah, it's exactly right.  I mean, now that we have Polywire, it's just like we have this technology that that allows us that nobody I mean, this is why I don't hate on, you know, old ranchers back in the old days, like they didn't have it.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:23:59):**  They didn't have the thing.  And it was unbelievably difficult to build long stretches of fences.  And, you know, it was everything that they did was sort of a remnant of the open range days.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:24:09):**  And so now now our responsibility is to take is to very judiciously take what worked, you know, and also throw away the stuff that didn't, you know, but well, you know, have in the back pocket.  But I think we're at a really interesting point.  Let me stick to the point a little bit.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:24:28):**  You know, obviously what we're doing is we're just we are trying to maximize the herd effect and right that happening at any given time.  And we're trying to maximize the amount of our pasture that's resting and recovering at any given time.  You know, that's that's the bottom line.  
**[0:24:44-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:24:44):**  And how densely you graze or how often you move your cattle, you know, it's all kind of tinkering around the edges once you once you sort of get into that zone of your moving, you know, once a day, once every couple of days, you know, twice a day, four times a day.  I mean, it's like you're in that zone where it's just sort of a small tweaking of what you do, as opposed to, you know, I move my cattle every two weeks.  You know, it's like, OK, well, that plant has already been hit twice.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:25:12):**  So awesome. And but and so and so we're basically we're we are working the new and sort of innovative practices that we're that we're really getting around to is just.  You know, I'll put it like this, actually. But it's sort of abandoning the saddle in a way.  Yeah. Yeah. And that's not necessarily the saddle doesn't necessarily need to abandon, because I think the future, particularly in the American West, is building out the infrastructure from the center out or from the infrastructure points out.  
**[0:25:49-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:25:49):**  You know, obviously there are lots of ranches, particularly here in the American West, the Mountain West that have big forest service leases, their pastures are so monstrous that they can't really.  Justify polywire and cross fencing everything at this point, but they got some pastures next to the house that they can damn sure graze a little bit better.  You know, that's that's for sure. And there are, you know, and if you institute a 20, 25 year plan to start building out your infrastructure from the from the from the well-built out points outward, you know, that's you know, that's that should be the goal.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:26:31):**  And in that interim period, I mean, obviously on these big ranches, you're always going to need horses to some degree and you're always going to need to have those skills to some degree.  But you have to be willing to abandon the saddle. You know, it's like the horse, the saddle, the boots, the spurs, the bridles, the reins, and that whole thing.  It started as a tool to manage cattle in a completely different time and place. And then it became the tail that was wagging the dog.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:26:59):**  Right. And now it's like those were tools in service of the culture of ranching. And now those tools have become the culture themselves.  And everybody, it was my experience growing up that everybody was all about the horses, all about the saddles, all of the spurs, all about the roping, blah, blah, blah.  Not once in my first 20 years of working on ranches did anybody say a damn thing about the soil. Not once.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:27:23):**  Right.  They, the only thing that I ever remember is my granddad making a reference to quote strong grass.  Like that is it. That is the compendium of soil ecology that I grew up with in the ranching industry.  
**[0:27:41-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:27:41):**  So what you have to do is be willing to divorce yourself from that culture.  And you know, that's easy for the average person who didn't grow up in it and is starting an organic compound in Maine or something to say, oh, yeah, I don't need a, you know, a saddle or blah, blah, blah.  But those of us out in the American West where the real work is being done and the where the real work to reverse the desertifying ecology is being done.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:28:08):**  Like we need to start seeing ourselves as ecological engineers first and foremost.  And then, you know, like obviously to talk to a lay person, you're like, oh, yeah, I'm an eco engineer.  They're not going to know what you're talking about.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:28:19):**  Obviously, you say I'm a rancher, certainly.  But in our own mind, in our own paradigm, the lens through which we view ourselves should certainly be characterized as that as an ecological engineer.  And then if you need a saddle, if you need boots and spurs and stuff to serve that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:28:35):**  Great, perfect, wonderful. Use it.  But it's all about, you know, are you using the tools or are the tools using you?  Because I know right now all you got to do is scroll through TikTok just a little bit to see that the tools are using people.  
**[0:28:48-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:28:48):**  Then people are not using the tools.  And I think that's I think that's a difficult concept for a lot of people to understand because they've they've bought into a myth.  And they have to shift their paradigm. Right. Yeah. Right.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:29:08):**  So what's what's one myth about you that you'd like to debunk, Hobbes?  What's a myth about me that I'd like to like, like a common thought that people might have about me?  Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's easy.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:29:26):**  The one is like the common.  Let's see, here's the problem. TikTok only gives you 59 seconds. Right.  And to to say something and you would need to go back and watch every single video to to sort of get the whole  
**[0:29:45-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:29:45):**  the whole concept of how I view myself and how I'd be ranching.  But people will see one 59 second video and they won't go watch the rest of them.  They'll go, OK, this guy hates conventional ranchers and he hates.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:29:57):**  Like, like, no, that's not that's not true at all.  I don't take it out of context. Yeah, right. I came from conventional ranchers and my uncle literally died on a tractor getting ready for planting.  Like I have no I have no qualms with grain farmers or conventional agriculture.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:30:18):**  What I would say is what I want to correct for people is that I very much see a future that is going to be characterized by far fewer inputs available to agriculture by.  No, not not by choice, but but by as a result of the geopolitical, ecological and financial forces that are culminating into this sort of perfect storm that we're experiencing right now.  So I'm a farmer and I don't hate conventional ranchers.  
**[0:30:50-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:30:50):**  I would just I would just say and actually, you know, I had a conversation this morning with a young man from Northeast Oklahoma who contacted me for some school assignment.  And I was talking to him about his operation, his 600 acres, you know, what they're doing out there.  And and and I asked him, I said, if you sat down and you imagine that next year you're only going to have 25 percent of the fossil fuel that you have available to you right now,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:31:20):**  do you think your operation would survive? And he said, no.  I said, well, I said, well, we'll do that.  Go sit down, pretend, do a thought experiment.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:31:32):**  How would you run your operation differently if you knew you were only going to have 25 percent of the fossil fuel available to you and then see if you can implement some of those some of those changes?  And and that is the number that is right there is the reason why I'm so highly critical of conventional ranching and farming practices,  because they will not be a we simply will not be able to do them for very much longer.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:31:58):**  It's like planning your it's like planning your family vacation and only having 20 bucks for gas.  You know, it's like you're not going to be able to make it to Disneyland, Disneyland, you know, because we just simply will not have the fossil fuel inputs.  I mean, I could go on for a while because, as I said, I got a degree in political science and one of the most important classes that I ever took was was peak oil.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:32:21):**  They at the University of Oregon in 2007, something like that, had a class on peak oil.  And we read like 12, 14 books on on this topic.  And ever since then, I've been furiously interested in it and I've been studying it very, very closely.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:32:38):**  And it is very clear to me that we are not going to have the same amount of fossil fuel within the next 10, 15, 20 years.  We're going to see a serious drawback in our fossil fuels we have available to us.  You know, if you think about I mean, this is an example.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:32:58):**  If you look back to April and May, you see what happened with COVID and the demand destruction oil markets with some futures trading negative.  And what kind of long term disruption that has in in the energy markets.  Right. The energy market, the oil companies have to make money.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:33:18):**  You know, you can't just and they have to make money, but at the same time, the consumer has to be able to afford that oil.  Right. And so it has to be in that sweet spot where it's profitable, but also affordable.  And, you know, that was and that is completely defined by the the the amount of money that the oil industry has to spend to get the money to get the fuel out of the ground.  
**[0:33:42-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:33:42):**  Right. If you look at the profit and loss sheets from these fracking companies, they have been zombie corporations for five, seven, 10 years now.  Ever since 2008, the only reason they've been able to survive is because of the, you know, ground, the ground level interest rates like, you know, Jimmy.  Like what were the interest rates during Jimmy Carter? Not that long, like 40 years ago.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:34:06):**  They're like 18, 20, 25 percent, you know, and now.  And that led to a farming crisis and a global crisis of an entirely different kind.  Sure. You know, sure. And but but you know, that was but now they can't bump it above two percent without the markets freaking out, you know.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:34:26):**  So we're in this we're in this weird phase where we can't basically what's going on is that we cannot facilitate economic growth with easily extractable fossil fuels anymore.  And we can only facilitate economic growth at this point with printing fiat dollars and increasing the amount of debt.  Like that's the only way we've been able to facilitate economic growth for the last 10 years.  
**[0:34:50-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:34:50):**  And up until that point, we were able to facilitate economic growth with increased energy availability.  And then it started sort of bumping, you know, they call it the bumpy plateau where it's, you know, it tries to rise, can't do it, reaches critical resistance and dips until it's cheap enough where people can afford it.  And then it rises again and hits critical resistance and dips. They call it the bumpy plateau.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:35:13):**  And once that happened, we were struggling to increase economic growth.  And obviously everybody in Washington is like, we got to have economic growth, which is just an insane paradigm in itself, which is a whole different.  But but we have to give tax. We have to transfer wealth to Wall Street.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:35:30):**  So we'll donate to our campaigns. Yeah, exactly right.  I mean, it's just it's just it's it's a horrifying you know, the financial model that we're on right now is and have it for a long time is is just it's a horrifying thing.  And it's really strange. And, you know, we are kind of going down a rabbit trail here.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:35:51):**  But, you know, we talked about interest rates back in the Carter era being super high. And then there was commodity price collapse, which caused a lot of guys in the farming and ranching industry in my area to go out of business.  And you made an interesting comment. And I have nothing to challenge you on that.  If interest rates go above two percent, that's going to cause a lot of energy companies to collapse. But the flip side of that with interest rates being held so low is there's no money being invested in and pension funds because there are a lot of like public pension plans that kind of were predicated on a seven to eight percent return on interest.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:36:34):**  And now they're getting two percent. So we're seeing a lot of a lot of pension funding problems.  And I think that the next one of the next big bubbles is pension fund. But we don't want to go down that road, get too much further down that rabbit trail.  You know, there's always a way where we can keep going if we want. Let's let's try to circle it back a little bit towards ranching, though.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:36:58):**  Right. So just that just well, just just I mean, basically, the idea is that we're holding a wolf by the ears right now as Thomas Jefferson.  That I mean, that's really it. We're just holding a wolf by the ears and we're going to have to turn it loose at some point. And when that happens, farmers and ranchers in particular better have really thought hard about how they are going to structure their businesses so that when they have less fossil fuels available to them, that's that's the basic overall idea.  Right. And it's not that it's not that peak oil says that overnight oil is just going to end.  
**[0:37:33-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:37:33):**  It's right at some point in the near future, oil is going to rapidly become much more expensive and it's going to be almost a geometric progression as far as the increase of price.  Right. Is the difficulty of finding it and the increased demand from the ever increasing population of Earth and ever increasing industrialization.  Right. Is that right? Nail on the head for sure. Yeah. All right. Well, now that we've now we've covered the sufficiently apocalyptic asset.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:38:05):**  Right. Yeah. I mean, I think there's nothing wrong with a ranch becoming self-sufficient.  I think I think some of the most successful ranches have learned not to be conditioned into like buying into the marketing where they don't need to buy feed.  They don't need to buy fertilizer. Like if they're just managing differently, then they're getting the same or better return by being self-sufficient and not having to rely on fossil fuels or outside sources to bring into the ranch and reducing their overhead by doing that, too.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:38:39):**  Right. As Brian likes to say, I mean, it's just as effectively as as efficiently and effectively as you can deploy solar energy.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, one of the one of the questions I have down here is to poorly describe what you do for a living.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:38:57):**  And I'd like to go for it. You already kind of did. My dad came up with this back in the 80s after his first trip to ranching for profit.  He said that he was a solar commodity broker.  And I think I was like 10 years old at the time and he's telling me this and I'm looking at him like, what does that mean?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:39:19):**  But I get it now because, you know, Hobbs really were in the same business and really, you know, we're in the same business as as corn, soy farmer, the guy that makes alfalfa hay.  We're in the business of capturing sunlight and turning it into protein.  Right. Yeah, absolutely right.  
**[0:39:42-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:39:42):**  I mean, you want to like my my daughter has this set of toys for the bathtub.  Right. And so it's like you plug them on the wall and you try to you pour water in the top.  It's like these tubes with wheels and gears and stuff, and you try to get the water to go through as many of the different layers and turn the wheels and activate the things.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:40:04):**  And before you know, you want it to, you know, hit as many of those little tubes before before you hit where the water gets back into the bottom of the bathtub.  Right. And that's you know, that's that's kind of how I see it's it's where we're trying to deploy that solar energy in a way that it makes its way through as many possible processes.  Before it's kind of not necessarily lost, but, you know, incalculable.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:40:29):**  Right. So as as many of those those ecological processes as we can funnel that solar energy through, you know, I think that I mean, that's if we can maximize that process, that's that's what I do.  You know, I, you know, I'm just a kid playing in the bathtub, just happen to be using solar energy.  Right. You know, we said earlier that poly wire and reels have allowed us to put a gas, a brake and a steering wheel on that cow.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:40:58):**  And the metric I like to think about is harvest efficiency.  How much of the grass that I am growing every year based on growing days of sunshine and rain.  How much of that forage am I effectively consuming and how much of my stockpiling and how much of my wasting.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:41:18):**  Right. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's like how much of that.  This is one of the amazing things that I've sort of spent a lot of time thinking about is is simply the notion that that grass like grass wants to be eaten.  Right. I mean, you look at the grass plant and what is a grass plant doing to protect itself?  
**[0:41:40-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:41:40):**  Right. I mean, like nothing. It's not trying to protect itself at all.  So it's it's reasonable to to to speculate that like it has worked being eaten into its overall survival pattern.  Right. And so when like it needs to be broken down, it's like what, 60 percent cellulose.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:42:00):**  Right. Nothing can break that down except microorganisms, which are found only in the soil or the rumen of a rumen.  Right. Right. And conveniently, when the when those herds wash by, they're they're putting a big dose of microbes right into the soil with their poop.  Of course. So, I mean, it's like that. And that's most effectively cycling carbon in the ecosystem.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:42:23):**  I mean, so it's like I mean, that flies directly in the face of the old notion of take half, leave half.  Right. I mean, it's that's sort of been the mantra of ranchers for many years.  And I'm sure it served its purpose in some regard to, you know, to prevent people totally raising their their pastures to the ground.  
**[0:42:43-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:42:43):**  Because, I mean, if you're if you're doing a big pasture grazing and you're not moving your cattle,  but what's every two or three months or something, you graze the ground like you have like real problems, you know.  So the take half, leave half is is kind of everything boiled down to the absolute simplest thing they can say.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:43:01):**  Yeah. Motivate people. Just move their cows. Yeah. Yeah. Right.  Yeah. I mean, I can I can certainly I can certainly see that. And I think what that is, is that's like the lowest common denominator.  That is not. Yeah. It's not. Yeah. It's not truly like you're taking half like you're using half.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:43:23):**  But half of that is actually going to trampling to organic matter.  It's not all just what the animal is eating. So it is a concept that I think is misconstrued or it's outdated almost.  And it's what half is being, you know, it's not like they're going to stop halfway and up. Right.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:43:42):**  It's like what plants are they going to eat? Like, obviously, they're going to hammer the most desirable plants,  the most desirable half. The visitors. Right. Yeah. The desirable ones alone.  And then then, you know, you wake up 20 years later and you're like, oh, my God, well, where all this cheatgrass come from?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:43:59):**  It's like, well, no duh. Like, like obviously it came from you allowing your animals to selectively graze.  And I mean, the bottom line is I think that the thing that people need to focus on a lot more is is the is the concept of non-selective grazing.  I think that, you know, non-selective grazing is is just such a it's so important because it touches on all of the aspects of what you need  
**[0:44:23-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:44:23):**  from your cattle and your land management. Right. I mean, you have you we have one hundred and fifty years or probably longer of these baby cattle  that we're allowing to just go out there and pick the pick the orange chicken out of the buffet and then, you know, leaving leaving the Brussels sprouts alone.  And so we have these these cattle that are so difficult. They're hard keepers, you know, and I think are much of our cattle industry is characterized by these hard keepers.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:44:51):**  And so then to try to solve that, we get we get these EPDs. Right.  And so then we try to try to tinker around the edges with these these scientific calculations instead of just going, well, well, well, which cow which cows are doing really great on your on your land in less than ideal conditions.  All right. Those ones. Well, let's let's take some bulls out of those ones. Let's take some replacement heifers out of those ones.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:45:13):**  Like your land is telling you what to do instead of us conveniently trying to worship the size of our own brain and figure out how we can calculate these EPDs and blah, blah, blah.  It's like it's it's so simple. We just you know, we were just so overcomplicated.  But I mean, the bottom line is non-selective grazing, I think is extremely important. You'll immediately see.  
**[0:45:33-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:45:33):**  I mean, Brian, you can talk to this all day. You'll immediately see which cattle can handle it, which cattle can't and which cattle deserve to be proliferating their genetics upon this planet.  Oh, absolutely. But the thing I think that is important for people to understand is selective grazing, non-selective grazing are are two different grazing strategies.  And both can be contextually appropriate depending on your environment.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:46:04):**  You need to talk more about that, because I mean, I, you know, I selectively graze, but only with my Finnish animals. Like I don't like it.  What what would be an environment context that you would say, like, OK, here's these mother cows and I'm going to allow them to selectively graze?  Like what what like maybe like calving season. I do that during calving season. Right.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:46:28):**  I'll give them, you know, a week at a time during calving season. But outside of that.  Oh, like at this time of year, I'm I've kind of backed off my daily moves and I'm a really low density and I'm, you know, I'm I'm in a very selective grazing scheme,  letting them go around and find the find the good bits, because I don't have a lot of good cool season grass in most of my pastures.  
**[0:46:50-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:46:50):**  So I'm more focused on warm season grass. And then next spring and next fall, I'm going to focus on trying to develop some cool season grass in some areas.  I think there's a time and a place. For for different grazing.  Schemes throughout the year and like I said, you know, it's it's it all depends on context,  
**[0:47:18-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:47:18):**  you know, where I'm at on the brittleness scale as far as temperature and humidity and growing days of rain and soil type and the types of plants I can grow are going to be completely different from where you're at or,  you know, some of the other guests we have lined up. So.  I just have to say, you know, that management needs to be contextually appropriate for your grazing environment.  
**[0:47:42-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:47:42):**  Well, yeah, and also your you know, your infrastructure, certainly, but, you know, would you say that next year you're going to that the pastures that you're on right now will have some degree of nonselective grazing?  Oh, yes, yes. And definitely on an improving plane. And we I don't know, I can't see the plateau in the plane is definitely a trend of improvement.  Right. Well, that's I mean, that's I mean, that's one of the things that I said in one of my videos on TikTok, right.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:48:10):**  It's like you don't have to nonselectively graze every time, but it would be good if you could do that like once a year.  Make sure that, you know, if you can if you can visit nonselective grazing upon your pastures once a year, then they will they will improve.  I mean, certainly that there is no better mechanism as far as I've been able to tell for improving your pasture than giving it an annual nonselective grazing.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:48:37):**  And so, I mean, yeah, absolutely. There are times and places and, you know, like if it's say it's rainy and mucky, obviously,  you don't want to do nonselective grazing because you'll just put your pasture up and wreck it.  I mean, obviously, I mean, I think that the thing that that Brian and I are dancing around here is just the notion like you don't want to be married to an ideology.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:48:57):**  Right. You don't like and I'm not married to the ideology of nonselective grazing, but I am.  But I do think that there are that that is I think selective grazing is over practiced and nonselective grazing is under practiced.  And so I lean towards the evangelizing of nonselective grazing, you know,  
**[0:49:22-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:49:22):**  because there are plenty of people doing selective grazing out there all the time.  And it just really doesn't. And, you know, obviously it is important to to articulate the contextual assessment of your grazing.  But, you know, look for what I'm saying is look for opportunities where you could be nonselective grazing at the appropriate time of year.  
**[0:49:40-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:49:40):**  And you will find that your pastures will improve as long as you know, oh, yeah, 1600 pound cow that you're trying that you're trying to keep in good clutch.  Wow. So and I had a you were going on and I thought about a great question and then I forgot it.  So we'll just go on and maybe I'll remember to circle back. Oh, I remember what it was.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:50:05):**  So we're talking about selective grazing and nonselective grazing and you know, you and I know what we're talking about.  So why don't you go ahead and define that for the people that are probably listening to this and are hearing those terms for the first time.  So tell us what you mean. Tell us what selective versus nonselective means to you and talk a little bit about where you learned that.  
**[0:50:27-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:50:27):**  Nonselective is effectively enforced grazing of all of the plants in a certain area. Right.  And so you accomplish that by bunching your animals up densely enough so that the competitiveness rises to the point where they don't pass up on anything.  Right. Obviously, obviously selective grazing is where they get they have enough enough area and low enough competition level that they can afford to pick and choose and pass up on things.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:51:02):**  And obviously, during a selective grazing regime, you will the most palatable and desirable plants.  Oftentimes the plants that you want to proliferate are the ones who are going to get hit and the ones that you don't want to proliferate are the ones that are going to be passed up and allowed to, you know, say go to seed or allowed to strengthen themselves or what have you.  But basically nonselective grazing, which I completely learned from Johan and Jaime, Johan Zitzman, the Zimbabwean and Jaime Elizondo, the Mexican, and who lives in Florida now.  
**[0:51:40-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:51:40):**  But yeah, basically, I mean, when I was sitting at a counter doing the whole Mr. Mom thing, I don't know, it's probably not politically correct to say that now,  but doing the stay at home dad thing, you know, I found out about Alan Savory, saw his TED talk and then read his book and I was like, Oh my God, this is amazing.  And then somehow I came across Zitzman's book after that and I was just like, Savory, whatever, you know, Savory did an unbelievably amazing thing for grazing.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:52:16):**  And like nothing against savory, but when I read Zitzman, I was just like, Oh my God, this guy's a genius.  And, you know, it's like I just I the way that he, you know, just turned ranching on his head in my mind was just incredibly valuable for me.  And what and his whole his his one of his big practices is nonselective grazing, you know, with the mature mother cows.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:52:43):**  I mean, he allows selective grazing with his heifers and your finish animals.  I mean, yeah, that's no problem. They should put on weight. They should serve you and they should make you money.  And especially if you're going direct to consumer, you know, you have to find a way to balance that.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:52:56):**  I think Jaime has actually done taking it the furthest in terms of balancing the herd that needs a little bit more TLC and the mature mother cow that he heard that he grazes quite hard.  So, yeah, nonselective grazing in short, it forces them to eat everything and selective grazing allows them to pick and choose.  OK, good. Thanks for thanks for breaking that down. Well, did I miss anything, Brian?  
**[0:53:27-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:53:27):**  I mean, I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Well, you know, I've done a lot of grazing in the last couple of years, a lot of strip grazing.  We've kind of bounced. I kind of like to stay in a daily move where I'm marginally selective, just kind of riding that line between selective and nonselective.  You know, I think once you get towards that nonselective, you have to be you have to be really precise in there, because if you're just a little bit too small, there's not enough feed for everybody.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:54:01):**  So I like to allow for a little bit of wiggle room in there. So I might not be as totally nonselective as as somebody in a different context with,  you know, a more consistent pasture or more consistent forage.  Right, absolutely. I mean, you know, it's like this it's it's an art, right?  
**[0:54:21-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:54:21):**  It's not I mean, this is not this is not a hard set set of rules.  This is this is right. You know, you're the you're the you're the director of the orchestra, I think is what Jaime likes to say.  And and that's exactly right, because, you know, sometimes it's a little too loud, sometimes a little too soft.  
**[0:54:36-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:54:36):**  Sometimes the brass comes in early and sometimes the woodwinds come in late, you know, so you got to you got to balance all of that stuff.  And, you know, well, by God, if you're given a little bit of wiggle room, that's that's still, you know, a million times better than the days of the old open range, you know, grazing practices.  I mean, we're we're what this conversation is, is we're just you know, we're splitting hairs right now compared to right.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:55:05):**  Compared to what the the the the width of the actual grazing spectrum.  You know, we're just like talking about like the half of a percent difference here, you know?  So, I mean, basically anybody who's listening to this is going to take it away, is just going to go look at their pasture and be like, oh, do I maybe I could do daily moves instead of weekly moves or something like that.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:55:26):**  And just every step in the right direction is going to improve.  And people will people will walk right up to that edge of what works for them in terms of their schedule, in terms of their infrastructure, in terms of their comfort level.  They'll walk right up to that edge and that edge will will serve them and the ecology much better than it currently is.  
**[0:55:45-0:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:55:45):**  I mean, basically, we're just trying to get people to go, you know, maybe maybe there is some room for improvement here.  You know, maybe that maybe we can maybe just just just asking yourself is is the way that I've been doing things, can I improve on it a little bit?  And when I say improve, you know, am I willing to cast off certain elements of my personal and inherited mythology that would allow me to make more money, improve my forage in my ecosystem,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:56:17):**  but but still allow me to preserve my heritage and who I am?  Because that I mean, that can not be understated.  Like ranching, there is no other there is no other occupation except maybe like policemen or firemen, where what you do is such a huge part of your personal mythology.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:56:36):**  Like accountants aren't like, you know, mom, daddy did it this way, so I'm going to do it this way.  I mean, it's like, no, the tax laws have changed.  So I got to shift my practices here.  
**[0:56:47-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:56:47):**  So I mean, but so with ranchers and farmers in particular, it's very difficult because the way they do things is interwoven into the into the lens by which they view themselves.  And once you're getting into the realm of talking about how people view themselves, like you're in you're in dangerous territory, you know, and it becomes an ego.  Right. Then when you challenge someone's paradigm, they take that as an attack on the ego.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:57:16):**  And I want to I want to lay a quote right now, right at a year ago at an event called Soil Health U, Ray Archuleta from Understanding Ag was there.  And Ray said. The only compaction problem on the farm is compaction of the mind.  Now, open your mind to a new paradigm. Right. So, I mean, I'm actually interested on in the how that quote relates to the actual physical compaction.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:57:53):**  Is he is he saying that like compaction is really not that big of a deal?  Yes. Right. If you have healthy, I mean, it's it's taken two ways and I actually questioned that night at dinner.  You know, you take it two ways. Compaction isn't a problem because if you're grazing properly and have a good poly.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:58:14):**  Yeah, it'll fix itself. You know, you'll have those deep rooted plants that over time, right out of penetrate that hard pan, break it up and start aggregating the soil.  Yeah. And the perception that is a problem only exists in the farmer's mind. And that's an extension of ego.  Right. Because it's so hard to accept that, you know, it's so hard to accept that.  
**[0:58:39-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:58:39):**  It's not that we've been doing things wrong for 60 years, it's that we haven't tried to learn a better way in the last 60 years.  Or unlearn things. I think that's a huge one I've been working on personally, too, is I have to unlearn some behaviors that are just naturally rooted and you'll be better off.  Like where you're saying, like not taking things personal, like about like, I think that's something I've had to learn is like, it's not really about me taking things personal.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:59:10):**  It's more about just accepting that this is something that we need to change or fix and then not think that it's like a personal attack on me as a person or how I how my ranching management schemes are with with with other ranchers.  And so I always when I'm working with ranchers or just people in the community, I have to like kind of just don't care about that.  I don't care about myself that way because then we can work faster and get through these barriers.  
**[0:59:41-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=0:59:41):**  Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean, that sort of puts you in the the the ranks of the rarefied individual who can shed shed the perception of self.  Right. Agree to to improve. And, you know, that's that's yeah, that's that's that's amazingly difficult for, you know, testosterone poisoned, you know, hard Arizona cowboy or whatever, you know, and and, you know, nothing against those.  Those people are amazing. You know, the things that that that I mean, like the guy who I worked for in.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:00:21):**  But during my summers in college, this guy named Rex Green and his dad, Tom Henry Green, ran the ranch, but Rex was his son about twenty five.  And, you know, Rex basically taught me everything I knew about, you know, riding or starting colts, how to rope properly.  You know, the the traditional cowboy way. And, you know, a few years after I left, he and his team won the the World Championship Ranch Rodeo there in Amarillo.  
**[1:00:47-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:00:47):**  Like, oh, wow. Like, I will never be able to be as good of a cowboy as this guy. Like, it will never happen.  And, you know, and so there so I have this massive amount of admiration for somebody like that.  But if they if somebody like that could then, you know, attain this transcendent state of being able to shed that and move into a position of viewing themselves as an equal.  
**[1:01:17-1:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:01:17):**  As an ecological steward, as opposed to a cowboy slash slash rancher, like that, you know, that's like ranching nirvana right there, you know.  So, yeah, like, I mean, the I guess what I'm saying is those those super uber punchers, like those guys are trying, they're trying to like be be the future that we need in ranching.  Like, if you can just like take as much pride in growing grass and improving your soil as in how you throw a loop, like that's because the organic compound, you know, people in in, you know, Maine and and in Minnesota or whatever, like that, like those guys are doing amazing stuff, but they will never be able to cowboy, especially if they didn't, you know, grow up in it and if they've started late.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:02:10):**  And so basically, but the but the cowboys can always become ecological stewards.  So, yeah, what I so what I'm saying is that it may be a little insulting, I don't mean it to be that way, but like all of these amazingly skilled cowboys who are talking so much shit on me on my TikTok, like, I'm like, you guys are supposed to be the saviors, like you can, yeah, you can be the ones who, you know, take this to the next level, because, you know, we're never going to be poly wiring.  All of our pastures, at least in the next, you know, 50 years. So we're going to need you guys to be cowboys and to be bad the badass dudes that you are, but we also need you to be ecological stewards, you know.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:02:53):**  And so we're, we're slowly moving towards that, but, you know, but it's, but it's a, it's a, it's a battle.  Yeah, it's, it's an uphill battle. And I think you and I are both on the front lines. And it's gonna be, it's gonna be fun to kind of watch how everything unfolds.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:03:14):**  So, so tell me what has been your biggest failure so far in the ranching industry, cattle business, and what has it taught you?  Well, the, my biggest failure thus far, I mean, the, my pine needle abortions I'm dealing with right now are kind of a kind of a bummer. That's for sure.  That's, you know, the biggest failure I've had in ranching so far is, oh, man, that's, that's a tough one. I think I've been kind of lucky.  
**[1:03:48-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:03:48):**  Well, here's a, here's my biggest failure. I think, you know, to be perfectly honest, I think the reason on the same, same, same vein that we were just discussing,  I think the reason why I've become a good grazier is because I wasn't ever a very good cowboy. I mean, I can, I can, I can do the cowboy thing, but I was never like, yeah, let's go to a ropin, you know.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:04:13):**  I can empathize with that, Hobbs. I'm useless on a horse and you hand me a rope and I'll just start tying square knots in it.  There you go. I mean, it's like, I can, I mean, I can do those things, but I will, but it, but I, but my biggest failure is like, I will never be as good of a cowboy as my granddad.  And he was, he was legendary. He was like, he was a legendary dude. He's one of those dudes when he died, you would call somebody in another state and they'll say, all right, well, we'll spread the word, you know.  
**[1:04:41-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:04:41):**  So he was a legendary dude and he was the perfect dude for his time.  But I think that being out of the industry, my, I failed out of the industry effectively when I was like 22, something like that, because, you know, it didn't interest me to the degree that I would continue doing it.  And then I, in the industry that I knew was that commercial cattle world. So I, so I failed at being a conventional rancher and it allowed me to succeed once I reentered, you know, with this new,  
**[1:05:10-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:05:10):**  you know, paradigm. And other than that, you know, I've, I've been really lucky with my networking ability, like, you know, knock on wood, my, my mentor and who, like, I talked to him, I don't know, four or five times a day, I'm going out to help them, not four or five times, like four or five times a week.  That would really irritate him if I called him four times a day. He, you know, he's, as I said, you know, runs 400 mother cows, a big forest service lease, and he's also a large animal vet.  So I, you know, I would, I would call him all the time and be like, yeah, is this the beginner, beginner ranchers hot wife, you know?  
**[1:05:49-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:05:49):**  And, and so it's like, so I've been able to avoid a lot of wrecks just because I have him on sort of speed dial. And I think that goes to the importance of having a really good network.  And that goes back to how to win friends and influence people. And this notion of personal mythology actually really plays into that.  Because if you can, the way to, the way to get people to like you is if you validate their personal mythology.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:06:21):**  And so you find those people that you like and the things about them that they, that they clearly take a lot of pride in, you validate that.  And don't do it disingenuously, like, you know, something that you think is stupid, but they love and you, you know, that's like, that's, that's disingenuous.  You don't want to do that. But things that you admire about that people, about people that they clearly take a lot of pride in, like, like, don't take any shame in pointing those things out.  
**[1:06:48-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:06:48):**  Like, I, you know, like one of the things that he's done that I've, that I never hesitate to comment on, because I am just so in awe of it, is that he, he figured out on his own,  the appropriately, appropriately adapted frame size for this part of the world where, or just, you know, where everybody else, you know, has a cow that you get lost in when you're doing a rectal exam.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:07:14):**  He has these more, you know, moderate framed animals. And I'm like, like, how did you figure this out on your own? This is amazing.  Like, I had to read books to figure this out. He figured out. And so in doing so, you validate people's personal mythology and you, and you, you express to them that you have,  you appreciate what they have done. And like, you're, you're in effect, you're saying you used your life well.  
**[1:07:37-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:07:37):**  And that's what people love, love to hear. And if you believe it, which is the only time you should validate that, then it will help form a really strong connection.  So, you know, I have, I have failed some, but I, but more importantly, I've been able to avoid failures by creating strong connections.  Obviously, I failed by allowing my cattle to seek cover in a pine, in a pine lot. I'm like, okay, I did a lot of reading on it.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:08:06):**  The literature was like, okay, they need to eat two to three pounds of it per day for multiple days in order to really affect them.  And I know I did my best, you know, judgment of how much pine needle access was in there.  And, you know, I was like, okay, I think they'll be fine.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:08:21):**  But I was kind of wrong and I've lost one already and I'm probably going to lose another one.  Two is not bad. We'll see how the, we'll see, we'll see how the rest of them go.  So how that has, how that has influenced me, you know, ultimately, what it has shown me is, is kind of the,  
**[1:08:38-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:08:38):**  it's one of the weaknesses actually of the least land model.  If you don't have a permanent land base and you have to, if you have to constantly sort of shuffle things around,  then you're kind of making do with half measures and that's not a permanent solution.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:08:54):**  So you certainly want, if you're going to do on, be on a least land model,  you want to get as long of a lease as you possibly can.  That's, you know, super important.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:09:06):**  So that you can kind of make it quote your own because, you know, as Greg Judy says,  the minute that you're on somebody else's ground, you're in the beautification business.  And that's, you know, it's absolutely true.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:09:16):**  And so if you can show people you're beautifying their land,  then they will give you much greater latitude to make the improvements that you,  that you need to make.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:09:24):**  And then, you know, maybe you can, you know, cut down some of the pine trees or you can,  you know, remove some of the lower branches or whatever.  But to the same degree, as Brian was saying earlier, it's like, you know, we're,  
**[1:09:37-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:09:37):**  we're trying, we're doing everything that we can to select cattle that are appropriate for our part of the world.  And you know what, my part of the world is dominated by pine trees.  And, you know, there's got to be some epigenetic factors that  
**[1:09:52-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:09:52):**  contribute to whether they, those animals are survivable or not.  So, you know, I mean, Greg, Gabe Brown is another great example.  It's like all, he had four years of failure and it taught him basically everything he knows about regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:10:06):**  I mean, that's the first chapter of his book is his first four years of failure.  And, and so yeah, I mean, let's see what other failures that I've, you know, I think those are, those are pretty much the main,  I mean, I am definitely, there have been a couple of periods where I've pushed my cattle too hard and had to back off.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:10:27):**  And it really up their protein content so that I could get some body condition back on them.  So, I think there's some value in knowing where that line is.  And I think that's part of that danger of getting into that non-selective regime, because you,  
**[1:10:46-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:10:46):**  if you miss that target by just a little bit, you know, you could hit a protein deficiency or an energy deficiency in their forage.  Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, I, but I will say, I think that has been valuable that,  that I've crossed that line. And I did it early before, you know, I have 800 cows or whatever.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:11:08):**  So, yeah, I mean, it's, and I think that that's one of the interesting things is that we,  our industry is characterized by practices that have been successful and in creating healthy animals.  And so the, so the animals haven't had to be pushed to any large degree.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:11:28):**  And so we've allowed basically inferior genetics to proliferate. And, you know, maybe it's time  for us as an industry to start pushing our animals a little bit more instead of, instead of propping them up.  I mean, I'm not saying push them as hard as, you know, say I have or, you know, to the, to the point where you're making them eat twigs and pine cones.  
**[1:11:50-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:11:50):**  Like, like that's obviously not a good idea. But, but I think that, I think there is some room to,  you really question, have we been babying our animals too much? So, you know, I don't know.  It's my biggest, my biggest failures. I mean, I'm kind of in, I think one of my biggest failures right now.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:12:09):**  We, we have, I've yet to see the damage from this pine cone abortion issue. But definitely not going to let that happen again.  So what are some things that you know now that you wish you knew when you started?  Well, that a conventional ranching background prepares you for almost nothing in a regenerative paradigm.  
**[1:12:46-1:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:12:46):**  I mean, I think I can agree with that.  Yeah, I, I, it was, it's actually, you know, I was like, oh, no, I grew up in this. Like, I'm a, you know,  a fifth generation rancher, land manager. I can, you know, I'll be able, this will be fine. And then I'm just like,  
**[1:13:05-1:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:13:05):**  oh, the cattle are out again. Oh, there's no ground on my hot wire. Oh, this, this cow is not in good shape.  Oh, they're calving. But you know, now I'm moving them too frequently. You know, like, it's just this, it's a totally  You can't move a cow that just had a calf 12 hours ago. She won't be able to find it.  
**[1:13:27-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:13:27):**  Right, exactly. Exactly. And so, you know, you're like carrying a calf around, you know, so, you know, it's like,  it's, you know, the bottom line is just, it's a totally different game. It's a totally different game.  And the people who will be able to play both games are the ones who are going to succeed, I think,  
**[1:13:44-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:13:44):**  in my opinion. And imagine if you have a ranch that is half, you know, regeneratively  grazed, and the hinterlands of the ranch are these massive pastures that can only be grazed,  you know, once or twice a year, and you throw them all out there for a month, and then you  
**[1:14:03-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:14:03):**  gather them up or whatever. So if you have that, like, you have to have an animal that is sufficiently  adapted to do well on that one half of the ranch that's regeneratively grazed, right? And then think  about how much damn weight they'll put on when you turn them out in the big pasture, right? So there's,  
**[1:14:18-1:14:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:14:18):**  yeah, there's just, there's just no, there's no downside to incorporating some degree of regenerative  regenerative practices. Like, I was custom managing like 25 pairs for a guy last year,  and I never, you know, in that 12 to 1300 pound range, and I admittedly, I pushed them a little  
**[1:14:36-1:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:14:36):**  too hard, and they started losing body condition, I had to back off and allow a little bit more  selective grazing. And they started to put on a little bit more body condition before they went  back to his place in, like June or July. And he called me about two months later. And I was a  
**[1:14:53-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:14:53):**  little bit embarrassed, actually, about the body condition that they had been returned in. And I  was like, Oh, my God, I cannot believe I did this. And, and he called me right before winter. And he  said, Hobbs, I have these cattle have never gone into winter, looking better than they look right  
**[1:15:08-1:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:15:08):**  now. Oh, wow. How funny. Yeah. I said, Well, what do you what do you think the difference is? And he  said, Well, these cattle eat like it's their job now. Yeah, their behavior, their behavior had  totally changed. And they, you know, they had learned to eat competitively instead of lazily.  
**[1:15:28-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:15:28):**  And so it was like, kind of like a boot camp for. But yeah, I mean, the bottom line is like, it was  almost like a boot camp for, for cattle. And even if you have these large animals, if you put them  through like a regenerative learning process, where they learn to eat non selectively for like  
**[1:15:46-1:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:15:46):**  a month, even if they lose a little body condition, once you turn them out into a into a,  into a less into a less rigorous paradigm, they will put on weight so fast. So yeah, that was  that was an interesting thing that I accidentally stumbled upon this year.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:16:06):**  So I want to know what have you done lately to sharpen your management acts? And what's,  what are you currently learning about that you're most excited about?  What I've been doing lately to sharpen my my management acts? Well, I'll tell you what,  
**[1:16:22-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:16:22):**  the thing that I spent so much time over the last three years, studying the regenerative aspect  of it, of ranching that now what I see as necessary is to expand the political and the  land use and the networking aspect of management, because it's almost like meta management, right?  
**[1:16:48-1:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:16:48):**  You can manage within the boundaries of your of your property, but then it becomes about managing  the what's outside of the boundaries. And you do that by, you know, being parts of groups by,  by speaking by being, being on boards. And this is something that I've really learned from  
**[1:17:08-1:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:17:08):**  my mentor, Jim Wood, he's like, he's on all of these boards, he's on the, he's on the phone  all of the time, to the point like where his employees are frustrated with him, because he's  always on the phone so much. But he is the last remaining independent producer in the the post  
**[1:17:24-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:17:24):**  Paulina Valley. And that's because he's been so adept politically. So with regard to my management  acts, like, what I've been really focusing on the last like four or five months in particular is  building my network, building my brand and building my sort of visibility, because that  
**[1:17:45-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:17:45):**  will give me the ability to grow and bring more land under my management so that I can then,  you know, continue developing that that management as well and that my, my management skills and one,  you know, one thing Brian, have you ever heard of a guy named Dwayne Lammers?  
**[1:18:10-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:18:10):**  Oh, I know that.  Yeah. Yeah. So he's worked with us a couple times. Yeah.  Yeah. So he's from South Dakota. He was in charge of the bison herd for, yeah. And he is now  
**[1:18:23-1:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:18:23):**  managing the Hana ranch in Maui.  That's why I was saying he's in Hawaii. Right? Yeah.  Right. Exactly. And he said, he said something I was talking to him on the phone, he said,  
**[1:18:33-1:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:18:33):**  I was talking to him on the phone about a year ago. And he said something very interesting.  It's like, well, when I got here, in the Hana ranch, they were doing a ton of these regenerative  practices. And the basic husbandry had been sort of abandoned. And so that's that. So I mean,  
**[1:18:51-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:18:51):**  maybe this is a little bit in opposition to what I was saying earlier about conventional ranching,  not preparing you for regenerative ranching. But to some degree, I've really just been trying to  make sure and shore up my basic husbandry, you know, like, just all of the, like the amount of  
**[1:19:13-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:19:13):**  rectal exams I've had to do lately, like, I've never done really many of them before. And,  you know, a lot of people probably rely on veterinarians to do that. And maybe I'm,  you know, lucky to have a little bit of guidance in that area. But, you know, basic husbandry,  
**[1:19:26-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:19:26):**  I've really done that to try to sharpen my vet and my basic husbandry and my infrastructure,  really tried to think farther into the future with my infrastructure. And with regard to networking  and being on boards and, you know, talking like to Oregon State soil scientists and stuff, one of the  
**[1:19:50-1:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:19:50):**  big things that I really, really want to get going on, particularly on my properties, even though  they are leased property is data collection, because obviously, the data is what's going to  tell you if what you're doing is working or not. And incidentally, data is now the most important  
**[1:20:11-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:20:11):**  commodity on a ranch. And I'll tell you, I actually had a really nice conversation about a  couple days ago with a guy named Matthew Warnken. And he runs a company in Australia called AgriProve.  And they basically facilitate all of these carbon credits that are being distributed to farmers.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:20:36):**  He's working like 377 different landowners in Australia that are being paid by the  governments and by the state governments there for what they're doing. And they're not just doing  carbon credits. They're doing biodiversity credits that are being purchased by the state.  
**[1:20:52-1:21:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:20:52):**  They are doing water retention credits that are being purchased by the state. And the way that  you get paid is by having the data to back this up. And so what he says is, regenerative agriculture  is all about funding model, and your funding model is all about data. So in order to sharpen  
**[1:21:13-1:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:21:13):**  my management acts, I have really been focused on how I can increase the amount of data that I have  recorded on the properties that I manage, and also has certainly highlighted the importance  of having a permanent land base so that you can control the management and then control the data.  
**[1:21:38-1:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:21:38):**  Not just control the management, but control the management long term with a long term stewardship  vision. I think that's really important to note is, you know, to some of these new guys that  are going out and trying to get a new land lease, you know, rather than just offering x dollars per  
**[1:22:00-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:22:00):**  acre, you know, you have to go out and you have to sell the landowner on what you're going to do  to make that land more productive, to make it a better place for wildlife and for cattle,  and how you're going to manage that to benefit the overall environment.  
**[1:22:22-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:22:22):**  Right, and that's going to be one of the interesting things moving forward,  especially in a lease land model is, is how are those, you know, the, say the rancher who leases  it does all the work to improve the ecology, improve the organic matter composition,  
**[1:22:35-1:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:22:35):**  improve the water retention, improve the biodiversity, improve the nitrogen cycle,  you know, and who's going to get paid for that once those credits start rolling in, once those  that becomes a viable source of income in the, particularly in this country, you know, and what  
**[1:22:49-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:22:49):**  kind of contracts and financial instruments will have to be implemented in order to make that fair  for everybody. I mean, certainly I have the, I'm like, well, I'm out here doing all the work. I  certainly want to get some of that carbon credit money or some of that, you know, so that's going  
**[1:23:06-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:23:06):**  to be, that's going to be a really interesting aspect as, as we move forward, particularly on,  with guys on, on lease, lease land, because I mean, if you own the piece of land and somebody  else was running it and they, and they were increasing the organic matter content and the  
**[1:23:22-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:23:22):**  government was paying for that, you'd be like, oh, okay, well, it's my land, so I should get some  of that money, right? You know, so that, that negotiation is going to be particularly interesting  moving forward. Yeah. I can't disagree at all. I think that's really going to change a lot of land  
**[1:23:40-1:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:23:40):**  leasing and land use dynamic all across the country, anywhere, anywhere agriculture is  practiced. So I know we said an hour and a half and we're just about out of time. So Hobbs, you're  the czar. You're amazing. I want to know great insight. Yeah. I want to know the first thing  
**[1:24:06-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:24:06):**  you're going to change 60 seconds ago. The first thing I'm going to change is to, to get people to  stop thinking about cattle as a, as a protein source and start thinking about them as an  ecological necessity. You know, it's like the ruminants are the only thing on this planet that  
**[1:24:24-1:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:24:24):**  can, that can process cellulose at scale. And cellulose is what every, every plant, you know,  trees are 90% cellulose grass is like 50 to 60% cellulose. You remove ruminants from the,  from the landscape. There is nothing to process that cellulose to, to make that carbon available  
**[1:24:42-1:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:24:42):**  for the next form of life. And if people don't start realizing that cattle are the only tool  that we can really use at scale in a world in the techno industrial paradigm that humans have  created and now dominate to sort of put what nature expects within this matrix of humanity,  
**[1:25:00-1:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:25:00):**  then we're going to be in real trouble. And so, you know, they basically, people got to recognize  that ruminants and cattle, they're an eco necessity first, then a beef source second. And  actually, there's one thing that, that Brian, I hope you don't mind if I share this, but you  
**[1:25:17-1:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:25:17):**  texted this to me like a couple of weeks ago. And it's like, you're like, I think we need like four  times the amount of cattle that we have currently to really just juice the carbon cycle to any  useful degree, right. And I thought that was really cool. And I think that, that right there  
**[1:25:34-1:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:25:34):**  would totally shift the notion of what of, you know, people are like, we should eat less beef.  It's like, no, we should have more cattle raised appropriately to the point where we have more  beef than we could ever possibly eat. Like, that's what should happen, in my opinion. And so, and the  
**[1:25:49-1:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:25:49):**  only way to get there is to start doing cattle as an eco necessity as opposed to just a commodity  protein source. Perfectly put. Hobbs, it's, it's been great. And I tell you, the time has flown by.  So before we wrap up here, can you tell our listeners where they can find you?  
**[1:26:08-1:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:26:08):**  Sure, absolutely. You can find me at, particularly on TikTok, the handle is  at Sisters Cattle Co. You can see the scintillating exchanges between Red Hills Rancher and Sisters  Cattle Co. there. And you, okay, you can also find our website at www.SistersCattleCo.com.  
**[1:26:27-1:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/1-Hobbs-Magaret-Managing-the-Meta-eqpjf7#t=1:26:27):**  I'm not much for Instagram, or Facebook, really, because on Facebook, I just get yelled at by  grain farmers and conventional ranchers. And on Instagram, it's like, you know, just hey, look at  my child. But, but TikTok forces you to give value, you know, nobody, the algorithm will not

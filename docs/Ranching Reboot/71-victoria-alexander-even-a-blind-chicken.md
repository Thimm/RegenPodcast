**[0:00:52-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:00:52):**  Check the show notes for a link.  This week I think I've got something really special lined up for you.  I have a small homesteader from upstate New York that's here to well, I'm not real sure  
**[0:01:04-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:04):**  where we're going to go with this conversation.  She wrote a wonderful paper that she sent to me and I ended up making three pages of  notes and I hope we're going to have a wonderful conversation.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:13):**  So from upstate New York, please welcome my not cousin or otherwise related Victoria Alexander.  Welcome to the show.  Hi, thank you.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:23):**  Thank you so much, Brian.  I want to thank my nephew Preston who's in Texas.  He's got a farm, 30 acres in Rockston and he's putting the fence up, got the pond in.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:34):**  He's going to do a beep master.  He told me about the show.  Well, I appreciate that and I appreciate the message you sent in.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:42):**  And we were kind of talking, we've been talking for a few minutes before I press the recording  button.  And you were introduced by, that's kind of what you said in your email.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:01:57):**  And then you sent this paper that I read and I'm really itching to get into it, but let's  put a pin in that and let's talk about you for a little while.  Let's talk about, tell me some of your story about where you're at and how you got there.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:02:11):**  Well, it's kind of odd that I ended up being a farmer.  I guess after 9-11, I was a little bit nervous about security and safety living in Manhattan.  So I took the train two hours north and found this little old farmhouse built in 1750 and  
**[0:02:36-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:02:36):**  taught myself how to farm, you know, on YouTube videos, bought some sheep.  And we're at the point now, I do canning about 200 quarts every year.  We're at the point now where if the food supply completely collapsed, we wouldn't starve.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:02:54):**  I'd be in better shape.  I'd probably lose 10 pounds.  That would be great.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:02:58):**  We wouldn't have any junk food.  Looking forward, looking forward to the complete collapse.  But when I was in Manhattan, I'm an academic.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:03:09):**  I'm a philosopher of biology and complex systems.  I don't know if being a philosopher of biology really helps with raising animals.  Helps me think about it in the larger picture of things.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:03:28):**  I would argue that being able to think about things in the larger picture is kind of critical  for anybody in agriculture.  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:03:37):**  You know, understanding an ecosystem is complex system science.  And that's the area that I worked in.  So yeah, I think it helps a lot if you understand that permaculture is really, you know, complex  
**[0:03:51-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:03:51):**  systems, understanding how complex systems work.  For sure.  So tell me about your permaculture garden.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:00):**  Well, you know, permaculture is a trademark name.  Did you know that?  Do I owe somebody 75 cents for saying that?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I, you know, I don't know if I'm doing permaculture the way that I should be, but I don't want  
**[0:04:18-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:18):**  to have to work too hard.  And I don't want to put herbicides and pesticides.  And so I've just learned over the years that if I put a ton of cottonwood leaves in my  
**[0:04:32-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:32):**  potato garden and stick the potatoes under there, I get a huge crop without doing any  gardening or turning over the soil or anything.  And you know, I didn't learn that.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:45):**  You know, I just had needed somewhere to put all my leaves when I raked them up.  And I found that that works for the cabbage really well too, and then put little mounds  on them.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:04:57):**  And it's terrible for eggplant.  Don't try that, you know.  And it's just trial and error over the years.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:03):**  I can't grow broccoli no matter how hard I try.  Broccoli is hard.  Yeah, I think you have to be in a different climate.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:11):**  Maybe California is better for broccoli.  We've had some, we've had a little bit out of our garden, like big, big, huge plant,  little itty bitty, like broccoli florets.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:21):**  Yeah, little tiny things.  Yeah, a lot of plant, not a lot of flower.  I do really great okra.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:27):**  I've known around here for doing a lot of okra, which is unusual for this area, but  I'm a Texan.  So of course I have okra that's doing great.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:36):**  And my asparagus is just nuts.  And so I have a little farm stand at the end of my driveway.  You know, I'm not a, I'm not a in the business.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:45):**  I'm just growing food for my family.  And then we have sheep.  It goes from six to 12 or 16 or so, depending on how many lambs we had and how many we didn't  
**[0:05:56-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:05:56):**  sell.  I got a cut on my face today because I got, I was wrangling a yew two days ago and she  kicked me in the face.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:05):**  That's okay.  I did one of these the other day.  And you know, for those of you that are, that do support on Patreon, you get to watch the  
**[0:06:13-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:13):**  video version on YouTube.  I had a big old piece of cow crap on my face.  Like I'm sitting here looking at myself going, what is that spot?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:23):**  And didn't even really clean up till afterwards.  So that happened, but hurts on the job.  Dangers, dangers of the job, I guess something like that.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:32):**  Yeah.  So we have, we have Navajo churro sheep and they are really hardy and don't eat that much,  you know, so we have five acres and that can, you know, that's enough for six to 10 sheep  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:47):**  say.  Tell me about that.  Tell me about those sheep.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:50):**  I'm kind of curious as to why I've never heard of that breed.  Really?  No, I never have.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:06:55):**  Well, they were on the endangered list for a while, but it was the Navajo Indians got  them from the Spanish.  The Spanish brought churro sheep over and the Navajo bred them.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:07:09):**  They're kind of a long, a little bit of a long haired sheep and that's what they make  the Navajo rugs out of.  It's a good, tough textile.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:07:19):**  So and they're good meat sheep even when they're older.  So it's nice they're both, not much of a milk sheep at all, but they're very, very hardy.  They never get sick and I've never had any problems with them giving birth either until  
**[0:07:34-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:07:34):**  this year.  One finally died and given birth and that was horrible.  But for, you know, June 12, 12 years or so, never had any problem.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:07:47):**  Interesting.  Never had to assist or anything.  So they're good sheep.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:07:52):**  So sheep that have been, sheep genetics that have been on this continent for a long time  have been adapted to live.  Yeah, in dry areas too, in dry, hot areas.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:03):**  They do well and they do fine here too.  So yeah.  Well, we haven't said it.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:10):**  So where is here?  You said two hours north of Manhattan.  Two hours north of Manhattan and it's just a little tiny town called Aminia, which means  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:18):**  pleasing to the eye in Latin.  Okay.  I wrote a novel called Locus Aminus, which is pleasant locale.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:26):**  I'm a novelist too, in addition to being a philosopher.  And it's a satire, it's a dark comedy about 9-11.  Hamlet is a 9-11 conspiracy theorist rewritten from modern times.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:41):**  So I have a-  That'll be interesting.  I'll have to make sure I have the correct spelling of that to put that in a show notes.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:46):**  I might even have to get that on Audible.  Is it on Audible?  It was just taken down.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:08:52):**  I got to put it up again.  Long story about that.  It's the actor who did the audio book died during COVID.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:09:01):**  And so the rights shuffled around and it will be up again soon.  It's up on my website for free right now.  But Locus Aminus is that it means pleasant location.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:09:14):**  It's sort of like Eden.  It's that pastoral paradise where nothing bad will ever happen until it does.  And so it's a long tradition in literature that in going back to the Greeks, talking  
**[0:09:28-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:09:28):**  about the shepherds, singing about their loves and things like that.  And so I set the book in Amina since it's Locus Aminus.  It's a same.  
**[0:09:43-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:09:43):**  And so it's a comedy about a city person trying to learn how to be a shepherd and interacting  with the locals and learning how to get along.  There's probably no real life flavor thrown in there at all.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:10:05):**  So how does a Texas girl end up as a philosopher in New York City?  I met a German boy in Dallas and went off to Berlin when I was a teenager and then flew  back to New York and didn't have enough money to go any further and got a job there.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:10:24):**  And that's the story.  That's it.  That's how I ended up in New York.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:10:31):**  And I liked New York.  I liked New York a lot.  Now I love Texas too.  
**[0:10:37-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:10:37):**  I look back at Texas and I see the independent people in Texas and I'm so proud of what people  are doing in Texas, not putting up with a lot of the government craziness.  We'll probably circle back into some of that later.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:11:02):**  From New York, it looks like you guys are doing better.  From here, we look at the coasts and wonder what y'all are doing.  Sometimes it's not real clear why the coastal elites want to do what they want to do or  
**[0:11:26-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:11:26):**  the policies that y'all want to think will be a good idea.  Sometimes it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to us out here.  As a lot of folks would call it fly over country, but that's fine.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:11:37):**  If you want to call it fly over country, just stay on the airplane and keep bouncing back  and forth.  If you want to look at some really pretty parts of the world, you got to get off the  
**[0:11:44-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:11:44):**  interstates every once in a while.  And don't forget that New York state is a huge state and it's mostly rural.  You got that tiny little island down there, the suburban.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:11:57):**  I'm two hours north of New York City and there's nothing out here.  We have one stoplight.  Actually, I had a young lady that worked for me a couple years ago and she was from the  
**[0:12:13-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:12:13):**  western part of upstate New York.  She said it's a lot like anywhere else in the Midwest.  It's just a bunch of small farms, trees, you could pull up to a road intersection and it  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:12:30):**  will be one quarter of cows, a quarter of corn, a quarter of wheat, and a quarter of  pasture.  Pretty rural.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:12:38):**  I think from watching television, we get a skewed sense of what most of America is like.  I don't remember exactly what the population is between urban and suburban and rural.  There's quite a lot of rule, certainly a lot of land.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:12:59):**  We can go back to, I think a lot of people need to return to the rural areas.  Now that everybody's working at home on their computers, they might as well, right?  What are they doing?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:13:13):**  I think that was one of the things that they were trying to say.  I guess one of the next things they'll push then is like, well, since all these people  are unemployed, we'll just give everybody universal basic income and everybody will  
**[0:13:26-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:13:26):**  grow their own food.  It's just that easy, isn't it?  Yeah, that's the cheese in the trap that UBI.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:13:36):**  The mouth is in the trap because it doesn't understand why the cheese is free.  Yeah, absolutely.  You said you mostly just do your farming or gardening for your family to feed your family  
**[0:13:53-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:13:53):**  and a little bit extra to feed the community.  Yeah, I call it my karma farm stand.  I have a little painted sign that says $5 for eggs or $4 for asparagus or whatever.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:05):**  But everybody knows that if they don't have the money, they don't have to put it in.  It's an honor system.  Sometimes there's $20 instead of five.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:17):**  So it works out.  You don't have any problems with that?  No.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:24):**  I know there's some people that take the asparagus all the time.  They just take all the asparagus.  I know that they don't eat well.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:33):**  They don't have healthy food and they like that asparagus.  So they don't pay for it and that's fine.  I'm also giving my neighbors plants like asparagus root and strawberry plants, nettle roots too,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:49):**  because nettle is a great food so that they can grow their own food.  And when everything collapses, I won't have to feed them.  They'll have something.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:14:59):**  I'm trying to get everybody around me self-sufficient.  Tell them how to plant potatoes.  Those are so easy to grow around here.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:09):**  You sound like you're certain that there is a collapse coming.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:16):**  I'm not going to disagree with you.  People that have been listening to the podcast for the last several months will know that  I've been warning.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:27):**  Things are going to get bad.  Things are going to get bad.  I don't think I've actually outright said collapse because I don't want people to start  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:33):**  throwing conspiracy theorists at me, which I guess these days is more just fortune teller  or you know.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:41):**  I mean, of course, people at the top do conspire with each other to hold their power and to  gain more power.  I mean, that's the term conspiracy theory.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:50):**  Theorists is a little silly.  You know, of course, people in positions of power are corrupt.  Of course they are.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, but yeah, you know, I mean, they hey, is this called the reboot instead of the reset?  Is this the alternative?  Well, I mean, we call it ranching reboot because trying to reboot your thinking about food  
**[0:16:14-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:16:14):**  systems, not necessarily trying to reboot society.  But I was just wondering if that was a remark on that.  We're not going to because we're not, you know, people say the greater reset or something  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:16:28):**  like that.  Yeah, the whole system needs to be reset or rebooted in a way we need.  We need major changes.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:16:35):**  It would be better if we could make them incrementally so that people don't starve or lose their  homes.  But as a complex system researcher, I understand that when there is a system wide collapse,  
**[0:16:55-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:16:55):**  that's the opportunity to rebuild it in a better way.  You really can't do those incremental changes, as we were saying before we started the show.  It's just too hard.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:17:11):**  The system is too entrenched.  But because the system is really reactive at this point, you know, I mean, the things  that the Federal Reserve is doing with interest rates and stuff, it's just, you know, or the  
**[0:17:22-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:17:22):**  CARES Act with creating trillions of fiat money and giving it to wealthy corporations.  That is just crazy.  That is just completely insane.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:17:34):**  And anybody that looked at that said, oh, OK, hyperinflation is coming.  Of course it is.  That's what happens when you make everybody stay home.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:17:42):**  But if you said that when they're trying to pass that last $1.2 trillion stimulus package,  if you said this is going to cause runaway hyperinflation, they said, you're just  a crazy conspiracy theorist.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:17:54):**  This will be fine.  We've got to pay people or the economy will collapse.  Well, when you do that, it's one thing if you threw a lot of money into the real economy,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:18:07):**  if you put money into our pockets and then we were able to go out and spend it and people  were out there working to make more goods and services for us.  But in addition to all that money, they had everybody staying home, not making any goods  
**[0:18:22-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:18:22):**  or services.  So that's when you have inflation, lots of money and nothing to buy.  That's the recipe.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:18:31):**  It always works like that.  And the danger we're facing right now, like if we turn back the clock to say, you know,  the 80s before Reagan deregulation, corporate mergers, and we started moving a lot of manufacturing  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:18:50):**  out of the country.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:18:54):**  That's kind of like the framework of what I'm going to talk about is like, we don't  make shit here anymore.  And that's what the last two years have really showed.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:01):**  We don't make anything here anymore.  We make food.  I would argue about the definition of food to some extent.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:14):**  But yeah.  And that's one thing we're still doing.  We have all this farmland.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:19):**  So we just need, you know, let's not, you know, Bill Gates is the second largest owner  of farmland in the United States.  And he's not going to farm it.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:30):**  You know, he's going to put it in conservation or whatever, rewild it.  I figured he would contract with soybean with people to grow GMO soybeans so he could make  fake meat out of them.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:43):**  I think they want to make the actual, you know, the lab grown meat cultured from humans  or from, you know, beef cells or chicken cells to actually...  They'll have to find something to replace bovine growth serum to do that with.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:19:59):**  Yeah.  And doesn't each one of those, like a quarter pound cell cultured patties take like gallons  of that bovine growth serum?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:20:09):**  I would imagine.  I would imagine.  And they're Elon Musk's brothers into those indoor LED, you know, growing lettuce and  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:20:21):**  lettuce cilantro, blueberries and tomatoes.  That's our menu.  That's what we get.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:20:28):**  And they're really careful to make sure everything is completely sanitary.  The workers, before they go into the grow room where all the robots are moving the plants  around, they sterilize their boots before they walk in and they've got gloves on and  
**[0:20:43-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:20:43):**  masks.  And I'm thinking, you know, my plants are grown right in the sheep poop out there.  There's always a little turd or so.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:20:52):**  There's a bone or two.  I mean, the microbiome, you know, you don't know what kind of microorganisms are necessary  to make a healthy plant.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:02):**  We have no idea, really.  I mean, we're just now learning about beneficial bacteria, you know, in the last 20 years or  so.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:10):**  And it seems like in the last two years we've gone the reverse.  Everybody's sanitizing their hands.  They're killing 99.9% of the good germs and they're leaving the bad germs on their hands  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:23):**  so that they can...  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:27):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  COVID changed a lot.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:36):**  And you know, they kind of weaponize fear.  I guess I used the C word.  So we're going to get another COVID warning on this episode.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:42):**  Thanks Spotify.  Yeah.  COVID made everybody weaponize fear.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:48):**  Fear against bacteria.  Fear against biology.  And it made you...  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:21:54):**  It's made us question things like, is there really natural immunity?  Is that a thing?  Yeah.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:01):**  So one of the things that made us doubt our own natural immunity.  And so go back to that paper.  That was one of my...  
**[0:22:07-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:07):**  The main point that I wanted to make is that a lot of the industrialized farming methods  have this assumption that nature is not intelligent on its own.  And as a philosopher, one of the things I study is what is the nature of an intelligence?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:23):**  Is slime mold intelligent?  If slime mold behaves in a certain way.  And so I look at really primitive organisms like that to try to understand what makes  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:33):**  slime mold smarter than AI, for instance.  That was one of the last papers that I wrote.  Okay.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah.  And so there's just this assumption by some of the people in power that the world is mechanistic  and that if you can just get enough data on it, if you study it enough, you can understand  
**[0:22:55-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:22:55):**  it enough to control it.  And controlling from that top down method with those hierarchies is dumb.  It's stupid.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:23:06):**  It's the only... Real intelligence is distributed.  Using the crowd to give you feedback and the reciprocity of the feedback of trying this  and getting some feedback, that's how our brains work.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:23:24):**  Our neurons all work together to come up with an emergent idea.  There's no real executive function telling our body, the rest of our body what to do.  And so there's these paradigms in the world, this mechanistic top down paradigm where you  
**[0:23:43-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:23:43):**  can control everything, you can control nature.  And then this paradigm where nature is itself intelligent if you learn to work with it.  And so you work with nature and nature can help you understand things better.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:24:00):**  In the paper I say that I work with my plants and my animals because together we're smarter  than I am alone, always.  And in that paper, there's things that are unanticipated that work out.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:24:17):**  For instance, I had a blind chicken.  Sydney.  Sydney, who wandered around and of course she'd bump into things.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:24:28):**  And she'd bump into the fence where the grapes are growing and would knock some grapes down.  And she's always randomly pecking, seeing what she could get.  And she would get grapes that way.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:24:40):**  And so one year we had a Japanese beetle infestation and they go for the grapes and she knocked  up against that wire fence and the beetles came down.  And so she's eaten the beetles and the other chickens saw that.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:24:58):**  And they imitated her by throwing their breasts up against the fence to knock down the beetles.  So that was, as a farmer, I let my animals take care of themselves, be a little bit self-sufficient.  I don't lock them in a cage and feed them because when they're out wandering around,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:25:23):**  who knows what they could discover.  Even a blind chicken could discover something that actually helped the entire flock out  and got rid of all those bugs on my grades.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:25:36):**  And so if you just let nature happen and observe it, then that was great.  That solved a lot of problems for me and created no new ones.  Every problem that you try to solve from the top down method by controlling things, you  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:25:54):**  create five other problems.  Kind of like a hydra.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:00):**  I'm glad you got that reference.  I won't have to edit that out.  So this paper that we're talking about, I'm going to try to get through the title here.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:10):**  Oh, I'm sorry for that title.  Isn't it an awful title?  I apologize.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:16):**  Well, it's your paper.  Let me just tell you that it's called Biosemiotics, which is bio for life.  And semiotics means the study of signs and the degree to which animals and plants use  
**[0:26:31-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:31):**  signs to communicate with each other and to understand the world around them.  Okay.  So the paper that we're talking about is titled Free Range Humans, Permaculture Farming as  
**[0:26:44-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:44):**  a Biosemiosic Model for Political Organization.  And that's kind of an intimidating title, especially for a guy that works with cows  every day.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:26:55):**  And I sat down, I managed to get through it with whatever my reading level is these days.  I managed to get through it.  I'm not going to lie.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:27:04):**  I had to look up more than one word and figure out like bio semiosic was definitely one of  them.  I had to look that up and I'm still not sure I have my head wrapped around it.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:27:18):**  That's fine.  That's fine.  Well, if I don't have to look up two or three words every time I read something, then I'm  
**[0:27:25-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:27:25):**  probably not going to enjoy that.  I learned something new that way.  So expands my vocabulary, have greater semiotic freedom, as we say in my business, which is  
**[0:27:38-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:27:38):**  like knowing two or three languages.  Then you can kind of pick up on more things in the world if you know more languages or  you know your cow language.  
**[0:27:49-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:27:49):**  People understand a lot more things.  So coming onto your farm, if they hear your cows, they probably won't be able to interpret  what's going on quite the way that you do.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:28:02):**  I know I can tell every one of my sheep.  I know what they sound like.  And I can tell when somebody is in trouble just in a minute or two.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:28:10):**  It sounds different.  And so if I had somebody, a caretaker come over to watch the sheep for a week, they might  miss something.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:28:20):**  So what he's ever going to be as in tune with the animals as the person that spends the  most time with them.  So that's really important for farming and industrial farming really tries to ignore  
**[0:28:31-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:28:31):**  that as if it's not important.  Do you think there's some something to emotional animal welfare?  Well, I guess so.  
**[0:28:44-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:28:44):**  I mean, I live in horror thinking that maybe my sheep are self-aware and they know when  some of them are sent to slaughter.  Kind of like how the slave owners used to think that their slaves weren't like real  
**[0:29:03-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:29:03):**  humans and they didn't value their offspring and it was just fine if you sold them down  the river.  I think people used to say that, but I say that about my sheep that I just sold six of  
**[0:29:16-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:29:16):**  them a couple of days ago and they're going to live on another farm.  They didn't go to the slaughterhouse, but just seeing them in that back of the truck,  I worry about them.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:29:30):**  And I know they're calling for each other and the ones I have here are calling, where's  the rest of the flock?  I know.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:29:39):**  Just wondering where everybody else is.  I have a few more heads than that and I don't know all of them on a personal basis, but  the longer you have a group of cows when you're out there every day for a couple of hours  
**[0:29:54-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:29:54):**  a day interacting with them, you get to know some of your superstars, both on the top end  and the bottom end.  Right now I'm commingled with another, let's just say rancher friend.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:30:11):**  His cows are with mine and I can tell a behavior change when his cow will get in with mine.  I'll have a group that'll still stick together and a bunch of his will stick with mine.  Then about a quarter of his will be scattered through the pasture and then about a third  
**[0:30:29-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:30:29):**  of mine will be off by themselves.  It's always interesting to watch how the different groups interact with each other.  You can tell a lot just by going out and looking at them, how they're holding their heads,  
**[0:30:45-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:30:45):**  how they're looking, where they're looking and how they're holding their ears.  There's a lot that just being in tune with your animals can teach you.  Take for example a pen rider in a big mega West Texas feedlot.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:31:02):**  If he's got to look at seven or eight thousand head of cattle every day, how well does he  know those animals, especially if they're turning over every 90 to 120 days or the hog  farmer in the confinement barn?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:31:14):**  He doesn't know those animals.  The chicken farmer, there's no way you can get to know a hundred thousand chickens in  what, six weeks, eight weeks that it takes to grow chickens now?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:31:24):**  Yeah, I know if one of my sheep are starting to get sick, I know it immediately.  Just a slight behavior change.  You know, that I give him something for the worms.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:31:38):**  That's one of the things that I was concerned about in that paper was talking about how  the globalization and to make everything homogeneous and everything the same.  We don't want a lot of communication among everyone.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:31:55):**  The world right now is a little bit too interconnected and there aren't enough regions that are separate  into themselves.  I mean, America has gotten so homogeneous.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:32:07):**  Like if you go into any major city, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, it looks kind of the same.  It's those same box stores and everything.  It's just, it's so disorienting because you say, where am I?  
**[0:32:20-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:32:20):**  You know, oh, there I'm in the Marriott and you know, it's the same Marriott that I was  in last month.  It's, you know, the regional character of, is so important that you have your own culture  
**[0:32:35-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:32:35):**  in this little area where you are.  You have your own music, you have your own stories, you have your own type of cuisine.  Those things are so, so important.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:32:48):**  And so like niche building.  And right now I think that there's a lot of talk about how people separate themselves  off and become extremists because they're not communicating with the mainstream.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:33:03):**  They're not watching the mainstream news and they're not like everybody else.  But the best way to foster diversity of ideas and to innovate is to have all these little  communities that don't interact, but interact a little bit.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:33:20):**  You know, a few people go and travel and come back and you have some visitors, but it's  just really important to maintain little niches, little neighborhoods, little regions.  Globalization is really a bad idea for diversity if you care about diversity.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:33:38):**  Well, I thought we were supposed to be this big melting pot of all different cultures  and peoples and ideas.  Yeah, you don't want to melt them together.  
**[0:33:48-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:33:48):**  You want people to be able to retain their ethnicity and their culture if they want.  That's why in New York it's so nice that we have Chinatown and Little Italy.  The people stay, they come from China and they move and they stay in one little neighborhood  
**[0:34:06-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:34:06):**  and they can retain their culture.  And sometimes people can live there in Chinatown for 40 years and never learn any English.  Which, you know, that disturbs a lot of people, I guess.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:34:19):**  But, you know, it's kind of cool that, you know, you can, although Chinatown is pretty  much disappearing now and Little Italy is pretty much gone because developers have come  in and wipe that all out.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:34:32):**  And, you know, there's probably H&M, you know, instead of H&M is a big clothing store chain.  Yeah, there's probably that instead of the big fish market that used to be there.  The fish market they used to sell fresh fish that the fishermen caught and brought in that  
**[0:34:52-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:34:52):**  morning.  Yeah, yeah.  And just another example of, well, that'd just be an example of local food going away,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:35:01):**  but probably not real.  Anyway.  So the question I have, I mean, we talked a little bit before the show about collapse.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:35:19):**  And that's something that I've talked about before with my friend Hobbs and, you know,  several other folks.  Do I think that, do I agree with you that we are heading for a collapse?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:35:30):**  Yes.  Do I think it'll be soon?  Yes, I think it's already starting.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:35:36):**  So other than like the basics that I've been yelling about for the last six months,  which is grow a garden and build your community food system.  How does your paper translate?  
**[0:35:53-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:35:53):**  So how can the biosemiotic scaffolding and principles prevent centralization, consolidation  of wealth and monopoly power as we're trying to rebuild down the line, assuming that, you  know, that I'm one of the ones that were some of the ones that make it through and get to  
**[0:36:11-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:36:11):**  the rebuilding part?  Well, as I said, you know, the hardest part to redesigning a system is taking out the  old one because, you know, the infrastructure is all there for to support the old system.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:36:26):**  But since the owners of the old system are taking it apart themselves because they have  a great reset agenda that they want to completely change, we have this opportunity to, once  the system collapse, to come up with better ideas.  
**[0:36:42-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:36:42):**  In the paper, I write about a different alternative monetary systems that, you know, I mean, I'm  a philosopher, so all I can do is provide, you know, a philosophical grounding for your  idea between the conflict between this mechanistic idea of the world and that we can, if we just  
**[0:37:07-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:37:07):**  understood things better, we can control them, which is scientism really.  And this understanding that there is something else in the nature of living systems and living  beings, we don't have to call it spiritual.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:37:23):**  I'm a scientist, so I'm not going to call it spiritual, but it's, I call it semiotic,  which is these immaterial relationships between living beings in the reciprocity of the, you  know, the good luck that a chicken like Sydney had.  
**[0:37:44-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:37:44):**  Those things are unpredictable.  And as I say in my paper, if you had a robot going around, you know, measuring the grapes,  you know, and eating them, it would pick up a beetle and realize it's not a grape and  
**[0:38:02-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:38:02):**  then, you know, if you built a perfect AI chicken, it could perfectly imitate a chicken  and even one day bumped up against that trellis like Sydney did and knock the beetles down,  it would still eat grapes because it was programmed because it was on the program to look for  
**[0:38:21-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:38:21):**  grapes that day.  And Sydney has the ability to misinterpret an object, a beetle for a grape and then go,  Oh, this is food too.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:38:32):**  So that is where, you know, where, you know, to some extent we're all somewhat robotic,  you know, we're automatons, we have these habits, we just go through the motions and  something we don't have to think to do things, but there are these moments where it's, you  
**[0:38:49-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:38:49):**  know, like the pathway splits and it depends upon an interpretation of the material thing  that's in front of your eyes and a robot is going to have a strict category.  It's either a one or a zero.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:39:05):**  And so it can't diversify, but a living being can choose a new pathway and discover an entirely  new way of surviving in the world.  And that's how evolution happens.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:39:20):**  You know, a robot isn't going to evolve on its own.  Not yet anyway.  My paper analyzing that is called Smarter Bots.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:39:34):**  I forget the title of that one because it's also long, but the idea we analyze slime mold  as the most primitive type of intelligent life known that scientists like to use in  their labs.  
**[0:39:49-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:39:49):**  And it can do really smart things.  It can find its way around a maze and, you know, a lot of people study slime mold and  it can interpret things.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:40:00):**  Normally it's set, its default motion is to head toward warmth because that's where the  food is.  But you can do this sort of trick to it like Pavlov's dog, you know, the equivalent of  
**[0:40:11-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:40:11):**  ringing a bell and you can train it to associate cold with food.  And even at slime mold, we're talking slime mold.  And so that shows you how organisms use signs because warmth is a sign of food and you can  
**[0:40:32-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:40:32):**  change that sign and make cold a sign of food for the slime mold.  And that's one of the things that proves that even primitive organisms use signs.  I bet neurologists hate you right now because a slime mold doesn't have a brain and you  
**[0:40:49-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:40:49):**  just prove that you can teach it something.  Right.  That's why I use the slime mold is because it doesn't have a brain stem.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:40:58):**  It doesn't have any nerves.  It just has a bunch of nucleotides.  It just has multiple nucleus.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:41:07):**  And so what it amounts to is anything, any life form that is a collection of individual  cells can behave intelligently.  Slime mold is a bunch of single cell organisms that fuse together.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:41:24):**  And so it has thousands of nuclei in it.  It's very strange.  But you can make analogies to the way a brain works too.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:41:38):**  I mean, a brain is also just a bunch of neurons.  There's no brain in each neuron, but collectively they don't have minds.  A neuron doesn't have a mind, but collectively these mindless things add up to something  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:41:51):**  smart.  Collectively, it's just a mass of cells powered by fat that all have kind of very similar  nucleus.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:41:58):**  Yeah.  And each neuron is complex enough to make interpretations of the signals that it's getting.  It's not always on or off like a one or a zero.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:42:15):**  Every biological cell has a little bit of wiggle room and can mistake one thing for  another.  For instance, we learn with this virus that the virus can attach to one of your receptors.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:42:32):**  That receptor is evolved to attach to something else entirely.  So when the cell docks with a virus, it's made a mistake.  It's made a misinterpretation that's lethal for it.  
**[0:42:47-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:42:47):**  And there's no way to predict what type of new protein on a virus might interact with  a protein in one of our cells.  It's very difficult to predict.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:43:00):**  Depends on the context and things.  So if we can get away from this overly simplistic mechanistic view of the world and have an  idea that things in nature are not wholly predictable and can't be controlled, maybe  
**[0:43:22-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:43:22):**  that would give people some humility and not think that, oh, I can just reorder the entire  agricultural system in the United States.  And we're going to tell all the ranchers are going to have to do everything this way.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:43:39):**  Everybody's going to have to grow their carrots this way and just decentralize and  let people make their own choices.  Some of them will fail.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:43:51):**  Some of them will do well.  The problem with decentralization is even though the people that are in control of the  current system are taking it apart or the current system is collapsing, whichever side  
**[0:44:08-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:44:08):**  of that particular fence you're on, everybody can agree the house of cards is coming down.  The question is, what's going to be rebuilt in its place?  And if we have to go away from centralization, like if that's the direction we need to  
**[0:44:29-0:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:44:29):**  go, how do we do that through this coming crash?  Well, Russia has a very good model, decentralized model of agriculture.  A long time ago, they made sure that everybody had access to a little plot of land and a  
**[0:44:47-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:44:47):**  little house called a dacha.  Or if they don't have a dacha, they have an allotment where they can farm.  And I think something like 80, 80, 90% of their potatoes are grown by individuals who  
**[0:45:01-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:45:01):**  have garden plots.  Only like 70% of their fruits, berries in particular.  So they've diversified their agriculture and it's much more stable because everybody's  
**[0:45:15-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:45:15):**  growing their own.  So if you get a problem on one farm, it doesn't spread.  One flock of chickens gets sick.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:45:25):**  You don't wipe out a thousand birds.  So there is a model already.  And I think in order to do that in the United States, the first thing that I would say is  
**[0:45:37-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:45:37):**  follow Henry George's notion that, kind of a modified version of his notion, but every  citizen in the United States deserves to own a subsistence plot of land tax free.  Interesting concept.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:46:02):**  It's not a new concept.  It's really like in Russia, they have that, for instance.  It's the idea of the commons.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:46:12):**  It's kind of an old idea.  But the first role of a government really is do no harm.  And if a government is taxing the homeowner for that little piece of ground that they  
**[0:46:25-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:46:25):**  have with a roof over their head, that's putting that family at risk.  The government doesn't want to do anything to make it more difficult for a family to  survive.  
**[0:46:40-0:47:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:46:40):**  And if you've worked hard and you bought that land and you bought that house, there shouldn't  be any risk that you would lose it because you didn't pay taxes.  So we need another way to fund the infrastructure rather than property taxes.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:47:03):**  And I mentioned in my paper that American Monetary Institute is an institute that's  been around for a while talking about monetary theory.  Ellen Brown with the Public Banking Institute.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:47:20):**  I told Ellen that I would shout out to her today.  So a government can create fiat cash out of nothing.  We know that because we just saw trillions created.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:47:36):**  But if you created that money and the Federal Reserve creates it and gives it to banks and  lets banks make money off of it, or they give it to Wall Street or big corporations.  But if a government, if the US Treasury, get rid of the Federal Reserve, if the US Treasury  
**[0:47:55-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:47:55):**  created dollars, greenbacks, because that's what greenbacks used to be, just for the purpose  of building the physical infrastructure, the roads, the schools, the hospitals, the train  lines, communication lines, internet lines, then the government could turn around and  
**[0:48:17-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:48:17):**  charge people very reasonable fees, maybe sliding scale fees to use that infrastructure.  And that way you wouldn't have to tax it.  I mean, right now the government borrows money and pays interest for things that it does.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:48:32):**  It's just insane because a government can literally and does print money.  But in 1914, the bankers decided, oh, no, if we got control of the monetary creation,  we would be able to create money out of thin air and then loan it to people at interest.  
**[0:48:49-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:48:49):**  Let's do that.  So could you imagine if you could just create cows on paper and then make money out of not  having to do anything material to, not having to create the thing that you're selling?  
**[0:49:05-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:49:05):**  I've heard stories of guys that have gone to jail for doing that.  There was a guy, I can't mention the name, but through another, it was kind of a second  hand deal.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:49:23):**  We got a call.  It was like, hey, I know I was going to bring you this many cows from this guy, but I got  another opportunity.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:49:36):**  We got this thing coming up.  They're just registered Angus herd.  We got to have a place to stash them.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:49:41):**  Can you watch them for us?  Will you tack on another 10 cents a day?  And dad was like, yeah, sure.  
**[0:49:46-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:49:46):**  Let's do that.  Well, turn out that these 250 registered Angus cows allegedly existed more than once.  While the cattle were on the ranch, his whole scheme fell apart and the FBI went and raided  
**[0:50:07-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:50:07):**  his offices.  The banker just showed up at the ranch one day demanding to look at the cows.  I said, excuse me, you are who?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:50:17):**  He explained who he was, that he was the banker that funded these cows.  I'm like, well, okay, if you want to go look at him, we can go, but you have to talk to  me and if you want to come back, we need to talk.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:50:30):**  Anyway, the short end of the story was, I don't think he went to jail for it, but there  was phantom cattle on paper that he bought, sold, and traded stuff that he didn't own  more than once.  
**[0:50:46-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:50:46):**  It's much harder to make fiat cows than fiat money.  This guy got caught because it's hard to do.  At some point, you're going to have to come up with the cow.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:51:00):**  He got caught and he got his wrist slapped.  Just a few years ago, I saw his name in the news for a very similar scheme and he was  in trouble again.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:51:13):**  I thought, you'd think they would have learned when they caught him the last time they would  have just put him in jail or barred him from ever owning livestock again or ever being  a livestock dealer, but I guess not.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:51:28):**  Yeah, it's funny.  Our court systems don't really work that well.  We always try to come up with regulators to slap the risks and impose the fines and things  
**[0:51:43-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:51:43):**  like that, but they don't do such a good job because they can get paid off.  That's a problem.  Whenever you concentrate power in the hands of just a few regulators, then it's easy to  
**[0:51:56-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:51:56):**  look to know where to buy the person that has the power.  It's willing to look the other way for a year or two in exchange for a really sweet job.  Maybe the courts are the better place to handle these things, but the courts are all clogged  
**[0:52:12-0:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:52:12):**  with drug cases and things like that.  And then you have to have the evidence.  You got to figure out how are we going to make this case and pay the lawyer.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:52:26):**  It needs money.  We need a legal system that doesn't depend on winning, doesn't depend on having more  money.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:52:33):**  We need a political system or winning office doesn't depend on having the most money.  I think we could maybe elect our representatives through lottery.  As long as there were term limits, I'm 100% behind that.  
**[0:52:51-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:52:51):**  Oh, guess what?  Ancient Greece actually elected their representatives by lottery.  It wasn't, I mean, it was only the patricians that were in the running, but.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:04):**  Well, I think everybody 30 and up or 35 and up being around for the lottery to go spend  four years in Congress and serve your government and serve people.  You'd be great.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:17):**  I hate it.  Yeah.  It'd be like jury duty.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:21):**  It would be awful, but we do it.  Everybody would hate it.  Nobody would want to be there.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:26):**  Nothing would ever get done.  And no new rules would ever get made.  Well, good.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:30):**  No rules.  We don't need it.  You know, they pass 650 laws a year in acts a year, bills a year in Congress.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:39):**  Do we need that many?  I mean, if you think about what acts would you keep, if you could get ready, you know,  one of my friends said, well, I would keep the freedom of information act.  
**[0:53:50-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:53:50):**  I said, well, that just describes to you all the hoops that you have to jump through in  order to get the information that you should have had from the beginning.  So I was like, what other acts had, you know, and if you think about it, it's really hard  
**[0:54:03-0:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:03):**  to think of any acts.  I mean, I don't think we need the income tax.  If we, if we used fiat money to build the infrastructure and then charge people to use  
**[0:54:13-0:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:13):**  it, we wouldn't need that.  We keep, we keep talking about fixing the money.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:24):**  That's the root of all evil.  Fiat money is a problem.  And I've had several, I've had several folks on before to talk about Bitcoin.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:35):**  And I only bring that up because Bitcoin is lost something.  It's crashed.  Like I never got it.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:41):**  I never, all my libertarian friends were, were advocating for Bitcoin.  I don't think you should have fiat money.  I think you should money back by infrastructure.  
**[0:54:50-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:54:50):**  So you have infrastructure money.  Well, so, so if you have, if you need to back your dollar with gold, okay.  Say we're a government, we're setting ourselves up as a new government and we need gold to  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:55:05):**  back our currency.  What do we do?  Well, we got to steal it from somebody or tax the citizens to get it right.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:55:11):**  Or we get it or we just, you know, get an army and we go take it.  Big army.  Yeah.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:55:17):**  So that's, that's not very nice.  Instead, if we, if, if we had, if our citizens were on board with this and, and believed  in the faith and credit of the government, we could print a greenback and give it to  
**[0:55:35-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:55:35):**  people to build infrastructure.  And then, you know, like internet, you know, or, or, or by the existing internet cable.  And then charge people reasonable fees to use it $25 a month instead of a hundred.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:55:55):**  And you know, I mean the, there's no reason why you couldn't do it that way.  You know, print the money first and then, and then in effect, collect the taxes from  it later as people are using it.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:56:10):**  And that wouldn't be as, as painful to people.  You hate writing that, that check for, for taxes if you pay taxes.  But you don't mind so much paying the cable bill or the.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:56:26):**  Because A, those are mostly, those are generally voluntary.  B, it's a service that you want and that you have decided that they're providing you a  good service at a fair price, and it's a good value for your dollar.  
**[0:56:42-0:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:56:42):**  And that's why you choose to do business with them.  There's some States I could mention that I won't, that I would probably choose not to  drive in anymore because they don't spend money on their roads.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:02):**  Roads are always the thing that comes back on us libertarians.  Like who will build the roads?  Who will build the roads?  
**[0:57:09-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:09):**  Who built the roads on my ranch?  I built the roads on my ranch.  I take care of them so I could get around.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:16):**  And because I built the roads, I don't want anybody else to use them and tear them up  because that's just more work for me.  So when, when people say, well, who will build the roads?  
**[0:57:29-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:29):**  I understand who will build the roads, but there's maybe some other, who would build  the roads to say, interconnect the communities?  Would that be a function of government?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:39):**  Yeah, I mean, right now, you know, in my little hamlet, the hamlet builds the local roads  and the county builds the county roads, the state builds the state roads.  You know, I mean, I think roads are I don't know why it's such a contentious issue, really.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:57:56):**  I mean, can we talk about wars instead?  Can we talk about, you know, it if I look at my I look at my little hamlet.  Roads department, and I can see that they're not doing such a good job sometimes.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:58:11):**  And they're just, there's this one road that's in this beautiful part of the valley, and  they're always up there just kind of sitting around enjoying the view and we're paying  for that.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:58:22):**  But you know, I can, I can deal with a little bit of corruption.  The roads are okay.  I've got I've got I've got bigger fish to fry than worry about the roads too much.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:58:38):**  I mean, they are a mess.  I just drove to Ohio in the spring after after the winter season.  They're just terrible, you know, they're ruining your car.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:58:50):**  But you know, if that were all we had to worry about with the government, I'd be okay, because  we go to town hall and you could argue with them.  I want better roads, I want cheaper roads, I want, you know, more efficient roads or  
**[0:59:02-0:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:59:02):**  whatever.  But we have so many, you know, I would like a government that just was like building and  maintenance department.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:59:11):**  Yeah, no, not controlling my, you know, any ideology or any kind of behaviors or controlling  what they teach school children, school children, absolutely not what kids are supposed to eat.  So yeah, so I would absolutely love it.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:59:27):**  If my government just built the roads, just just built the school buildings, maybe we  don't even need them anymore.  I you know, homeschooling is kind of a better way to to educate kids because my my son say  
**[0:59:42-0:59:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:59:42):**  that well, it worked out for me.  I don't know if it will work out because I didn't I could work at home.  So while I was working, my son was working on his stuff, but I'm out in society.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=0:59:56):**  I'm at the library.  While I'm waiting for my son to have music lessons, I'm at the cafe chatting with friends,  we go to museums together, we go to you know, the cultural sites and the historical sites  
**[1:00:10-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:00:10):**  everywhere.  And of course, the people at the museums and the historical sites are always so glad to  see these homeschoolers because they're the only ones who ever come.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:00:23):**  The only ones that ever asked questions.  Well, they're definitely the only ones that ask questions, but yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know, because they're, you know, homeschool kid is sort of like a free range student.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:00:41):**  And just like Sydney, they just bump into the wall and they learn stuff, you know, bump  into the wall, learn that thing that fell down might be something tasty to eat.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:00:54):**  What I guess what I was trying to tease out of you is what do you feel like public schools  are really for?  For me, I'd be happy to answer that and give my answer and go first if you want me to.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:01:06):**  Well, you know how when you're homeschool your kids and people find out about it, the  first thing they ask is, oh my God, how will your kids get socialization?  And I wonder where they got that word.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:01:20):**  Like that's the only time that's asked to criticize homeschooling parents.  Probably from the unions.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:01:28):**  During the lockdown, when all these parents were forced to homeschool their kids, I had  the opportunity to say, oh my God, how will you ever institutionalize your children?  That's awesome.  
**[1:01:44-1:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:01:44):**  Because it is a form of institutionalization.  You know, and it's crazy to think that all 1000 kids in this school, and in that novel,  I mentioned Locus Aminus, I also do a satire of public education.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:02:06):**  And the idea that they all need to learn these 1000 facts about history, they all need to  learn, you know, these 600 facts about biology.  Well, what if you want to learn, my son wanted to learn not the history of all the wars and  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:02:22):**  stuff, but the history of musical instruments?  Why not?  That's probably more important.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:02:29):**  To him, he's a musician.  So you know, we don't all have to know the same things.  It's okay if I know some things that you don't know, and you know, some things that I don't  
**[1:02:39-1:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:02:39):**  know, because then together we can, we know a lot more.  And I can ask you something, and you can ask me something.  But if we've all had the same education, then you know, and anyway, these days with as far  
**[1:02:57-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:02:57):**  as memorizing facts, we can just look them up, you know, what we need to learn is critical  thinking, critical and creative thinking.  I think that I don't feel like critical thinking skills are well taught in public schools,  
**[1:03:13-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:03:13):**  nor have they been for at least two decades.  Yes, I let me let me spring this on you.  So if you'll go for it, I think an important part of critical thinking is reading poetry  
**[1:03:29-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:03:29):**  and literary fiction, the kind of fiction and creative writing, where a line can mean  three or four different things.  You know, it sort of has this literal meaning, and then it also metaphorically, and then  
**[1:03:43-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:03:43):**  in the context of something.  So if you if you read that kind of writing all the time, every time every sentence, just  it's just full of meaning, and you don't take it literally, and you go, it could mean this,  
**[1:03:58-1:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:03:58):**  and it could mean that.  And you get to be a real critical thinker.  So then, now when you listen to a politician speaking, go, yeah, you know, he's saying  
**[1:04:08-1:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:04:08):**  that literally, but that also behind that he saw that there's this implied meaning,  there's a little bit of irony here, you know, in a context that's changed, that means something  completely different.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:04:22):**  And so learning the really sophisticated language in literature is extremely important for  developing critical thinking.  And these days in school, I mean, they'll assign a Dickens novel and then ask the kid,  
**[1:04:38-1:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:04:38):**  you know, what did the character McCarver's heard that, you know, the clerk's office,  and the kid will go, I don't know.  I don't remember, you know, they asked the kid to remember facts.  
**[1:04:49-1:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:04:49):**  I don't remember what happened in half of the Dickens novels.  But I learned that creative, that critical reading skill where I could interpret everything.  I'm going back to the importance of interpreting things in reality so that you have flexibility  
**[1:05:04-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:05:04):**  in what you can do.  So you know, but people say, well, I don't know why I have to read this poem.  That's not going to help me get a better job.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:05:16):**  You know, that's not going to help me make more money in the world.  And I think people have misunderstood what the function of languages after all human  beings are unique in our ability to use language and language at its, you know, the epitome  
**[1:05:34-1:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:05:34):**  of language is that there's not a literal, just a literal meaning that there's all sorts  of other metaphorical meanings attached to things.  And that's what makes us not robots.  
**[1:05:45-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:05:45):**  That's what makes us creative and flexible and able to imagine things in new ways.  So I think that's one of the things that's missing from American education.  And I know that's a hard sell, because people really do, you know, these kids are sitting  
**[1:06:01-1:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:06:01):**  in front of a TS Eliot poem and they don't, they can't figure out how it's going to be  useful.  So, but that's how.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:06:12):**  You make a strong point and I never really drew the connection between, you know, poetry  and critical thinking skills.  I'm not sure how I got mine or who taught them to me or where they came from, but I'm  
**[1:06:26-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:06:26):**  glad I have them.  And I think that it's not really taught in public schools.  I say my daughter, she's not biologically mine, but she lived with me for 10 years,  
**[1:06:41-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:06:41):**  so might as well.  Anyway, Tanya homeschooled her for four years, all while she would have been going to middle  school.  
**[1:06:51-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:06:51):**  And I think that was probably one of the most important times.  And, or I guess the last two years of grade school and middle school that I think that's  important because you know, you said socialization like that.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:07:05):**  That's the argument like, well, how are your kids going to get socialized?  Well, they're going to get socialized because they're hanging out with their parents all  day.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:07:11):**  And their parents are interacting with other adults all day.  And they're closely supervised in those interactions with other adults.  You think in that classroom with 50 kids and one teacher, that all those interactions that  
**[1:07:24-1:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:07:24):**  your child is learning from other children, you think that that's being supervised and  moderated by that responsible adult to the degree that you would want your child monitored?  No.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:07:35):**  That's not society, that classroom.  A homeschool kid is in society.  That's how they get socialization.  
**[1:07:45-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:07:45):**  And my son would, we'd spent a lot of time in cafes across the street from the library  and the music center.  So and we, you know, he would sit there and talk to a local lawyer about books that he  
**[1:08:00-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:08:00):**  was interested in science fiction books and recommend.  So my son got to interact with people of all ages.  And in homeschool, there's little kids and there's older kids and you will, you know,  
**[1:08:10-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:08:10):**  are all together.  And so it's a much more natural type of society, introduction to society.  That's why homeschool kids tend to be better adjusted and more independent.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:08:21):**  Yeah, I don't want to make generalizations, but the statistics do bear that out, actually.  So yeah, it's homeschooling is not an experiment that's failing.  It's something that's been done and has been successful for thousands of years, or at least  
**[1:08:40-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:08:40):**  several hundred.  Yeah, it's centralized institutional schooling.  That's the failed experiment.  
**[1:08:48-1:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:08:48):**  Yeah, and it's only a couple of hundred years old.  And if you think about the reason why it began, you know, people looked at kids who were going  to work at 10 years old, you know, they'd work on the farm or in their parents' shop  
**[1:09:04-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:09:04):**  doing some sort of, you know, apprentice type thing.  And they said, it isn't a shame that these kids are laboring and they don't know how  to read or write and they don't know mathematics or basic science.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:09:16):**  Well, they should go to school and learn those things because you never know, like, who's  the name is escaping me, most famous inventor in England who came from the lower classes.  I wish I could think of his name.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:09:34):**  You don't know where the next genius in science is going to come from.  Right.  You know, so you really want everybody, every little kid to have that opportunity because  
**[1:09:43-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:09:43):**  there, you know, there might be somebody you never know that could be really good in math  and, you know, or, you know, great at writing literature or whatever.  So you want to give everybody that opportunity to go into those sort of academic areas if  
**[1:09:56-1:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:09:56):**  they want to.  And then everybody should have, you know, sort of a material job that they that they  do too.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:04):**  I wouldn't want to just be a philosopher.  I'm, you know, I know I have to grow food to go to a useful skill and, you know, an  academic one.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:12):**  But so so now many years later, we look at our institution and we think, oh, well, that's  that's why these kids studying poetry and science and algebra, they don't ever need  that.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:24):**  They need to go to school to learn how to be, you know, work at a job or balance a checkbook  and or cook food or, you know, homemakers or, you know, work on cars or something like  that.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:38):**  And, you know, that's not what school, you know, their parents should be doing that.  They should be working after school.  They should have jobs when they're young.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:46):**  My son worked in an auto shop from age, I think, 11.  11?  Yeah, it's not exactly.  
**[1:10:56-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:56):**  Is it another?  I'm not judging.  Not not.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:10:59):**  Yeah.  I think another homeschooling parent invited him to come in.  So you just see how an auto repair shop work.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:11:07):**  And he he listed items on eBay, auto parts on eBay.  That was his job.  He came and worked on, you know, and it's just, you know, you need everything in your  
**[1:11:18-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:11:18):**  life.  But homeschooling provides all those things because, you know, I have my kid out working  in the farm too.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:11:24):**  And and also learning algebra.  I think the latest thing that I think I heard out of our local public school system is they  were trying to is that they're going to have like take these individualized education plans  
**[1:11:43-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:11:43):**  that they started for, I think, the seniors and the juniors.  And they're going to go all the way down to freshmen in the high school.  Like, oh, so now we're back to treating them.  
**[1:11:52-1:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:11:52):**  Now we're back to trying to educate them as individuals and educate them all to their  own strengths and their own needs versus putting everybody in a box and making us all take  a standardized test.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:12:04):**  It's kind of like they're trying to go back around full circle again.  I hope that's where they're going.  I know there's a lot.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:12:10):**  There's a push in this new thing called impact investing where you get these tech companies  inventing this software for education.  So and it's tailored to meet the students need.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:12:24):**  But it really is just a very limited, you know, the correct answer.  Okay, you get the correct answer.  You just like playing a video game and then you get rewarded.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:12:34):**  And it's not real learning if it's if it's that kind of gamification of your educational  experience.  I know Texas is a real testing ground for that kind of that direction.  
**[1:12:50-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:12:50):**  There's a woman called Allison McDowell, who is writing about this in honor blog called  the wrench in the gears.  And she's warning everybody about stakeholder capitalism impact investing, where the new  
**[1:13:09-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:13:09):**  way to make money for investors is to design, for instance, educational programs or welfare  programs, prison programs, to retrain people and train people so that they perform the  correct tasks.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:13:30):**  And it nudges people to be the kind of human that you're supposed to be, you know, with  this tightly controlled, you know, online education.  And you know, if you hear your school district talking about that sort of thing, run as fast  
**[1:13:50-1:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:13:50):**  as you can away from that, because they're literally, you know, they have this idea,  again, it's the mechanization that we can train kids like monkeys with rewarding them  and this like video game like thing, oh, you get little tokens, and then you get motivated  
**[1:14:06-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:14:06):**  to do more.  And, you know, that's, that's a real danger.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:14:18-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:14:18):**  So I'm trying to come up with a philosophy, you know, you have these, you know, different  economic philosophies of, you know, Darwinism, for instance, you know, the fittest survive  or whatever, and that, that that type of thinking ends up having a lot of effects, you know,  
**[1:14:41-1:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:14:41):**  you know, throughout the whole economic system and business and schools and things like that.  So when I try to introduce this idea of an interactive society, not necessarily cooperative,  like communists, everybody sharing together, but just if you leave people to their own  
**[1:15:06-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:15:06):**  devices, and you expect them to be somewhat self-sufficient, and you don't interfere too  much, you just provide those necessary constraints like roads, then people will flourish.  They won't need so much education and guidance and controls and laws, they just need a little  
**[1:15:26-1:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:15:26):**  bit of wiggle room, and they need the opportunity to plant their own garden and to find their  own books to read.  You know, government is just meddling too much.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:15:41):**  We don't need that kind of centralized control.  Any meddling is too much sometimes.  So decentralizing way of the future.  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:15:58):**  I've got to get out of here.  So where can we find you on the internet?  And how can people get in touch with you?  
**[1:16:03-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:16:03):**  My website is vnalexander.com.  And that describes the work I do as a philosopher and also my novels.  As I mentioned, I've written about being a shepherdess in upstate New York.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:16:22):**  Or actually, my character is male character.  Interesting.  Well, and the other one you mentioned, Locus Animus?  
**[1:16:32-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:16:32):**  Locus Aminus.  Yeah, that's the novel.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:36-1:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:16:36):**  I'm working on a new novel now.  I can't say the word because I hear but it starts with a C. 1984, the musical.  It's a comedy.  
**[1:16:49-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:16:49):**  A dark comedy about the collapse of our system right now.  Will you send me a copy of that, please?  It sounds like something I'd love to.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:02):**  Really, this is the first time that I'm, because this situation is ongoing and we're going  through these troubling times, we need to come up with the solution, right?  We all need to be ready with, you know, when the system does collapse, we need to go, hey,  
**[1:17:19-1:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:19):**  don't do that.  Let's do this.  It'll be better for us.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:22):**  Right.  So I'm trying to write the ending.  The ending of George Orwell's 1984 was really, really depressing.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:30):**  It's supposed to be.  Awful.  I want to rewrite the ending.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:35):**  It doesn't have to end that way.  The paroles, the plebes, the ordinary people.  Us.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:45):**  Us.  We actually can take our power back in a completely, you know, nonviolent way.  Just roll up our sleeves, plant our gardens, get organized.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:17:59):**  That's what we need to do.  At this point, saving seed, homeschooling and gardening are like three of the biggest  acts of civil disobedience that you can do.  
**[1:18:12-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:12):**  I've done them all.  Yeah, I've got a couple.  I got all three of those check marks too.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:19):**  Yeah.  And a few others we won't talk about.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:23):**  I might be on a couple of watch lists.  Probably have been for years and it's no big deal.  Okay.  
**[1:18:29-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:29):**  So VNAlexander.com, new book coming out.  Hopefully I can, we'll stay in touch.  I'd like to get a copy of that and talk about it.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:38):**  It sounds like a great book.  Great.  Yeah, I have some of it on my, as I'm writing it, I let people read it, which I never would  
**[1:18:47-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:18:47):**  do because I rewrite my books and perfect them and make them more poetic as I go on.  But I've got the draft out there now because I want to, I'm actually getting, letting people  write it with me because we have to make up this happy ending together.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:03):**  1984 as a dark comedy, but with a happy ending.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:10):**  I'll see if I can pick up anything.  Okay.  Thank you.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:14):**  I'd like to hear your feedback.  Anywhere else other than your website that you'd like, you want to send some traffic  or is that just the one shop?  
**[1:19:21-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:21):**  Yeah, public banking Institute.  Yeah.  This is a, you know, to, to fund a community where you have a local butcher and a local  
**[1:19:33-1:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:33):**  Baker, we need community banking instead of these wall street banks that have been charged  with the task of making sure that the community is healthy and the loan money within the community  versus the task of returning as much to the shareholders as possible.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:48):**  Yeah.  No shareholders in this.  No shareholders.  
**[1:19:52-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:52):**  Yeah.  Well, very cool.  Okay.  
**[1:19:55-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:19:55):**  Anything else you want to, you want to end with?  No, just great talking to you and, and meeting a possible relative, you know, maybe your  family's from, from air Aberdeen and Scotland.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:20:09):**  I'd like to find out one of these days, but like, like we talked about before the show,  I'm not sure that that history is able to be uncovered anymore.  It may be lost.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:20:18):**  Oh, well.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll come up with something.  
**[1:20:22-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:20:22):**  There's some reason why I went back to sheep.  Have a key sheep.  It's in my book.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:20:28):**  Well, this ranch was fenced for sheep, but, uh, that was under Skinner ownership, not  under Alexander ownership, which I suppose is another story for other podcasts.  So, okay.  
**[1:20:39-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/71-Victoria-Alexander-Even-a-Blind-Chicken-e1kn6dd#t=1:20:39):**  Great talking to you.  You too gang.  Y'all have a great week.

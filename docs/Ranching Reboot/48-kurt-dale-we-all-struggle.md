**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:11):**  So, Kurt.  Yes.  I know what you do for a living.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:15):**  We're neighbors.  So why don't you tell our listeners a little bit about Dale Family Farms.  I'll... Well, let's see.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:22):**  Where do I start?  I'm married to a lovely woman named Andy Dale.  We've been... In September, we'll be married 25 years.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:33):**  We've got three girls.  I've got a junior in college, a junior in high school, and an eighth grader.  My parents both turned 92 this year, and in June, they will celebrate wedding anniversary  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:49):**  number 70.  Wow.  That's amazing.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:02:53):**  That's mind-boggling.  That's awesome.  What's even more impressive than that is they still live... I call it the home place, where  
**[0:03:02-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:02):**  I grew up.  They're still living independently on the farm, and I see them every day.  That's less than a mile from your house?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:11):**  Yeah, about a mile and a half.  Anyway, I grew up in Protection, Kansas.  I'm an old Protection Panther where... That's part of the South Central School District  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:21):**  now, but I... That's not what you asked, but anyway.  That's fine.  That's where I grew up.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:29):**  I went to Huchajuco, then on to K-State.  I had a job for three years after I got out of K-State.  I majored in Ag Econ degrees when I left K-State, and I thought I wanted to be a grain merchandiser,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:49):**  and I had a phone stuck to my ear for about three years.  Gross.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:03:57):**  Now it seems like there's still times I've got a phone stuck to my ear, but it's... Anyway,  one day I decided I was ready to move back to the farm.  Now I blink... Three years goes by now in a blink of an eye.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:04:15):**  This is in my early 20s.  I mean, looking back, those three years seem like they lasted 15.  It seemed like... Anyway, I moved back to the farm Christmas in 95.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:04:30):**  1996 was my first full year on the farm, and it was... Brian and I were talking earlier  about how long farms have been the family.  There have been dales in Comanche County for well over 100 years.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:04:51):**  My grandpa started a chunk of what we have now.  It was started by my grandpa.  My dad, he'll carry a dad on.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:05:01):**  He moved back to the farm in the 50s after he and mom got married and moved back home.  There are six kids in our family.  I've got a twin brother, and he and I are the youngest of the six.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:05:16):**  I'm the only one on the farm.  I won't for a second say that I'm the only one that was interested in the farm.  We've got a very close-knit family.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:05:32):**  All my brothers and sisters very much love coming home and being part of the operation.  I was the only one that showed an interest in the day-to-day being a farmer.  Erik  
**[0:05:56-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:05:56):**  Which is kind of funny you put it that way because where we're going with the conversation  is a lot of that work I really got tired.  Anyway, we were pretty... I don't want to say we were pretty conventional because my  
**[0:06:16-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:06:16):**  dad and my grandpa before him, they had a way of thinking about and doing things that  looked like they were doing a lot of things that were conventional at the time, but they  could make just about anything work.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:06:31):**  One of the things we do now is we say we like to do the best we can with what we have.  My dad and my grandpa before him did exactly that.  The tools that were available, they made ship work.  
**[0:06:49-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:06:49):**  Anyway, cow-calf operation, we raise the feeders for a while, sell the calves in the spring.  Alfalfa, wheat, milo, the standard crops that grow well in Comanche County is what we raised.  Dad came up with an idea, he dreamed up a live bottom hay trailer and we got a tub grinder  
**[0:07:16-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:07:16):**  and we started hauling chopped hay in different places.  We had a pretty decent business.  I don't know if I call it side hustle, but value added, adding value to the hay crop  
**[0:07:28-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:07:28):**  by grinding it and hauling it.  Then I also did some custom work with that grinder.  The problem is that works like a lot of things.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:07:41):**  Dad was able to make things work because he could fix about anything.  The problem with running old worn out equipment is you have old worn out equipment.  And you have to work on it a lot.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:07:57):**  Well, and eventually, no matter how much it needs to be replaced, you need to be more  efficient.  Then you think, well, maybe I'll do custom work to help pick up that cost.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:08:07):**  And then the next thing you know, the time that you think you're saving by having better  equipment, you're spending doing the custom work to help justify the cost of it.  That's where I was at when I was thinking about upgrading some of this equipment that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:08:27):**  was wearing out.  And we went ahead and replaced some of it.  But in the back of my mind, I was like, there's got to be something better.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:08:41):**  And cost repairs kept going up.  Fuel, surprise, surprise, never got cheaper.  It kept going up as well.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:08:54):**  And Andy and I took a Dave Ramsey financial peace course.  Okay.  Dave Ramsey is legit.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:09:03):**  He is.  We have probably strayed somewhat from the reservation.  I like what Dallas liken that at the school that shall not be named to dead is like you  
**[0:09:21-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:09:21):**  use a tool and if the tool, a certain tool hurts you real or really bad, you're going  to be hesitate to ever use that tool again.  Anyway, that being said, we've restructured how we do a few things.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:09:35):**  And the, like a lot of things, the philosophies and the principles are sound.  Yes, for sure.  You'll look at, you know, in a lot of different ways, taking care of small stuff and knocking  
**[0:09:47-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:09:47):**  that out of the way and then moving on to bigger stuff.  But anyway, that that was, that course was instrumental in us really breaking down and  talking to each other about the dollars and cents of the ranch and you know, what we wanted  
**[0:10:04-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:04):**  it to look like, what we were doing.  And we're like, well, what can we do, you know, to, you know, add value to what we're  doing to get more bang for the buck.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:13):**  And so that's when we started playing with the idea of direct marketing and we started  out  When was this?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:22):**  Around 2005.  We've been we've been direct marketing for over 15 years, I suppose.  Okay.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:28):**  Six tech.  Oh, good Lord.  Probably.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:31):**  You guys are veterans, like in the grand scheme of the COVID world with all this.  Yes, yeah, we've, we've learned a lot of shit that does not work.  I can assure you.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:43):**  And that's why you're here, right?  Share all those things.  We're gonna need a lot more than three hours.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:50):**  If I just had a list and just didn't even go down any rabbit holes and still starts  telling you stuff that didn't work.  Kurt's list of shit that don't work.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:10:59):**  It's long.  But I should say that that is stuff that does not work for us.  Good point.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:11:10):**  Because what we've done, we tried stuff because somebody else did it by God, that's what works.  We went and listened to, well, we, so we marked a few animals to family first.  And when they when that was a positive response, you know, we thought, well, we finished two  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:11:29):**  animals on grass, let's try four.  And so we,  if the family didn't think it tasted like crap, you might know what you're doing.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:11:37):**  Right?  If we thought was the family, family and friends, family and friends, if they if they like it,  I will go, we'll proceed.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:11:48):**  When family was like, can you get it?  Can you can we get like a half or a whole animal?  We're like, okay, maybe we're onto something.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:11:55):**  And so then we did it with some friends.  And then we went to listen to Joel Salatin speak in Oklahoma City.  This was around.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:04):**  This was probably 06 or 07 when we we listened to him.  And that's when we decided we wanted to try poultry.  And you'll pass your poultry.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:15):**  And the first year, we I think we did less than we did 20 or 25 birds for the year.  So we'll just  the first just a taste.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:28):**  And we built and we built a small the pen like what Salatin made, you know, we put it  together.  Why say we my dad built it.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:38):**  We showed him a picture of it.  And he's like, okay, and then he, you know, two weeks later,  I mean, he had it was exactly what you see in his.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:45):**  Oh, that's cool.  Probably didn't measure anything.  He  
**[0:12:50-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:12:50):**  Yeah, it's a measure.  Measure seven times cut at once type of person that my dad I, I was not genetically.  I wasn't either.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:02):**  My grandpa was a craftsman.  He could build a dad could build.  I can repair a lot of stuff.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:09):**  I don't know if I can build anything.  I can build paddocks, but I can't build cabinets.  But anyway,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:14):**  an awesome chicken tractor that your dad built.  Yes, the Salatin.  So the first year we use the Salatin and it was pretty close to the house and it was with  
**[0:13:23-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:23):**  not very many birds.  We process those birds and to say, I've heard this story from your Yes, say it was a shit  show.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:35):**  That is toning the language down.  Anyway, do we need to call Andy and have her come up?  No, this is probably like this.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:42):**  This is another another show with Andy here and her tell the story to  Yes, she's gonna listen to this and she's probably gonna be slapped me on the arm.  But anyway,  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:13:53):**  are you gonna have to sleep on the couch for a while?  Tell the story?  No, no, no, no, no, no, because it took a while to get it done.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:02):**  We'll just leave it at that.  We learned a lot, right?  We did.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:06):**  We that was one of the list of things that don't work.  Yeah, it's, it's.  There's a lot of them that's involved that first chicken processing.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:14):**  And we didn't have much for equipment.  And we didn't.  There's a lot we didn't have then.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:20):**  My mother came down to show us, you know, the right way to do it.  And she probably knew how to do it from living through the depression in the 30s.  Yes, that's exactly right.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:32):**  And in process, you know, butchering their own chickens yield old spent land hens that  you know, growing up that they you know, when they had the, you know, chickens are on the  farm.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:42):**  Well, it went it took us two days to get all those birds done.  For reference now,  the two days to do the 25 birds for reference now, when we had Andy and I, and two of our  
**[0:14:59-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:14:59):**  girls and one other person can help us we can do a little over, we can do over 100 birds  in a little over two hours.  So it's just a small improvement in productivity.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:15:12):**  Yes, slightly improve that process.  Anyway, this one was rabbit holes, I told you I get sidetracked.  We, it tasted so good.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:15:22):**  We're like, okay, we've, okay, this tastes good enough there.  We could dang sure tell a difference.  And so but we have to be more efficient.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:15:31):**  And so we decided the next year we would do more birds.  Probably more birds meant we had to get further from the house.  And when we get further from the house, then we started noticing that what works in Swope,  
**[0:15:48-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:15:48):**  Virginia, for infrastructure, the it's like a lot of things that the philosophies are  the same.  But the method and infrastructure is pretty, you know, needs to fit the environment, right?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:03):**  We were cooking those birds with their feathers on I mean, we in in South the Salatin type  pins.  And so we've we went through several modifications to to what we have now.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:17):**  What we have now works.  We kind of have a day range system and we have a pin that's heavy enough that it's too  heavy to move by hand, but it's light enough, you can pull it up with a four wheeler or  
**[0:16:27-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:27):**  a ranger or something like that.  That means it's heavy enough, it won't get blown away in our 80 mile an hour winds too.  They I've if the winds blow primarily north and south, I have had east west winds that  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:39):**  scoot the pin sideways.  You have 300 pounds angular.  I'm dragging over the top of the chickens.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:46):**  That's that's not a good combination.  That's probably a wreck every time it happens.  It's never I've never had a pin flip over actually once.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:16:54):**  I don't know how this happened.  It picked up the side of it and it scooted it over and then it came down.  I mean, it's like it lifted it off the I didn't lose any birds.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:06):**  The hell of it was the next morning.  The birds were still they were held up where the pin was not not trying to get in where  it was now.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:15):**  They wanted they thought they're like, dude, where's where's my house?  Where's my house?  Yeah.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:22):**  So they're all huddled up in a pile where the shelter used to be where it used to be.  That's right.  And so you don't put them they free range during the day and they go in their pen at  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:30):**  night.  Right.  That's right.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:33):**  OK.  We that's they've they've bred the brains out of those birds and they we found that  if you get them hardened up, they can handle getting out in the heat, you know, with small  
**[0:17:44-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:44):**  doses as long as you have plenty of water for them to cool back off.  Yeah.  Another piece of that puzzle is those big white dogs we have.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:17:54):**  They the great Pyrenees, the guardian dogs we have, they roam a pretty good area and  they they keep an eye on things and they they don't mess with the birds.  They have an alert system, an hourly alert system for the most part.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:07):**  There's times that that system has failed.  Yes, there is.  Predators are smart.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:13):**  We had a coyote that we figured out that the dogs slept during the day.  And the coyote started showing up in the middle of the day to pick chickens off.  That sounds very, very familiar.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:24):**  That's exactly what's happening.  Because nobody else knows.  We have one of Courtney and these dogs.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:29):**  We have chickens at home and we have three chickens right now because Lily likes to sleep  during the day.  She's awesome at night.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:35):**  She patrols all night long.  How many chickens do we have six weeks ago?  30 chickens.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah.  And it's not it's not I mean, we've actually seen the coyote coming up into the yard in  the middle of the afternoons while she's on the front porch.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:46):**  And she does.  You were right.  When we talked about this.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:49):**  She sleeps during the day because she's up at night making sure nobody's in the yard.  Brian was telling me a little bit.  He told me it was hysterical when that happened.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:18:58):**  Let's not repeat that.  I'm not repeating that story on the air.  I'm not telling that in a recorded medium.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:04):**  About the coyote in the yard?  About what I did to Lily after I found the coyote in the yard.  Oh, I wasn't here that day.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah.  No, we're not telling that story.  Moving on.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:14):**  If anybody needs a great night watchman, either get in touch with Tawny or I because we have  one that needs a new job.  Because we don't have any chickens left.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:25):**  I just hijacked your speaker.  I know that.  I know the genetics of that dog and she has to be a smart dog.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:32):**  She's very smart.  She's very trainable too.  Just not so good about being a day watchman.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:38):**  You know, I found one of the most humbling things that one can do on any given day is  try to outsmart any animal on the farm.  Yes, 100 percent.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:50):**  Well I think our smartest chickens are what's left.  I mean, we've kind of had this conversation like if I can get a few eggs from the hen  and two roosters that are left and start over.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:19:58):**  I've got a good flock along with Lily because they hang out with her now.  The chickens just follow her around in the yard now.  And it's going to be that hen is one that you raised.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:10):**  That you raised from an egg or from a chick from an egg from last year.  So we've got some, you know, if we keep those chickens alive and get another set of eggs  out of them and generate some more chickens next year, we'll have some pretty good genetically  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:23):**  you know, adapted chickens to our environment.  Maybe.  Maybe.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:28):**  That's the theory anyway.  Well, I've had a lot of things that on paper look really good.  So I wish you luck.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:37):**  Everything looks good on paper.  Like I can make almost any enterprise work on paper, but in reality it's always something  else.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:44):**  Roger that.  So, chickens.  We were talking about your chickens.  
**[0:20:50-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:20:50):**  One of the rabbit holes, many of that will probably go down.  So we started the chicken enterprise.  For reference now, we'll probably put about 1200 birds a year in a freezer now.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:21:08):**  We start more than that, but you lose them.  In the brooder, that's a constant learning process and you have to watch that.  We get along much better with the pens than we used to.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:21:27):**  Predator loss, so on and so forth.  Sometimes you just have to have storms coming through is just part of it.  If you do everything you can to protect those birds from the severe weather that come through,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:21:43):**  all of a sudden you're getting away from the pasture.  They're not having that stress.  You take a lot of the profitability away from it.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:21:54):**  Well, in a lot of ways.  You're stressed too.  We lose chickens and the first, I think, three or 10 chickens I lost, it was pretty stressful.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:02):**  But after time goes on, you start out with 300 of them, you're probably going to end  up with 150 or 250 of them and not three when you're done.  At the end of the year, if we've put 75% of what we started with in the freezer, we've  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:17):**  had a good year.  I was going to ask the question.  Some years it's been less.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:22):**  I wasn't because I didn't want to make him say that ratio.  Well, I don't mean for him, but I just don't know in general.  If you're starting feeder cattle and you had that percentage, that would be bad.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:31):**  That's right.  That's why I was asking because I'm sure with sheep versus pigs versus chickens, it's  really different.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:37):**  Yes.  A tiny baby chick is not a huge investment.  No.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:43):**  No.  The Cornish crosses are not that bad.  Anyway, moving right along.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:22:52):**  The poultry was pretty good.  It was a constant learning process, but it was like a lot of what we started doing, we  take baby steps.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:23:05):**  Back to Dave Ramsey, and the steps would get bigger when we could economically justify  steps getting bigger.  When we would try something and it felt like we were trying to pound – I'm all for  
**[0:23:21-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:23:21):**  adjusting something.  But if you try two or three different things and it continually feels like you're trying  to pound a round peg through a square hole, we're like, you know, let's scrap it.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:23:32):**  Let's move on to the next thing.  Well, it wasn't – the poultry, we learned things and built on it and it's – I feel  like we've got a – it's a very worthwhile enterprise now to maintain.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:23:52):**  Somewhere along the line there, we also decided to add some pigs.  We bought feeder pigs to start with.  Then we dabbled with having a sow, breeding sows and as cool as it is to watch a sow build  
**[0:24:11-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:24:11):**  a nest and farrow out, you want her own, it's pain in the ass trying to keep a borer out.  It's a big dirty mess.  And then keep them separate.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:24:23):**  And so there's a couple of – two or three different sources we have for buying healthy  feeder pigs and, you know, buying feeder pigs right now is a better deal for us than trying  to raise our own.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:24:41):**  And so we buy them and we get them started.  We get them broke to hot wire, you know, in a confined pen and then we somewhat relatively  close to the – not – when I say close to the house, I mean within 100 yards.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:24:53):**  It's close enough that where we've got running water and we can – feed trucks can  get in to fill the pig feeders, et cetera.  We do have a – we say things are pasture but our pigs and our chickens, we do feed  
**[0:25:08-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:25:08):**  them a ration.  The chickens have to have something in that stomach to help grind up the grit.  And you're not – you're talking about a single stomach.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:25:18):**  You're not talking about ruminants.  But –  I don't know if that's a rabbit hole you want to go down but I think that's probably  
**[0:25:22-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:25:22):**  something that's kind of interesting that a lot of people don't know and have noticed  a lot on labeling lately.  When you go to a website where people are selling pastured animals or grass-fed animals,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:25:32):**  they're going to be sold as a grass-fed beef or a pastured pig or a pastured turkey  or a pastured chicken.  And I would imagine that the common man would assume that means they don't get fed a ration.  
**[0:25:45-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:25:45):**  So you guys want to like explain a little bit like real briefly why that is?  I would tend to agree with you that like the layperson, if they see pastured, that that  doesn't always mean what they think it means.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:01):**  Yeah.  And I mean even to me like I know I've got to feed my chickens.  There's plenty of bugs and food in my yard but you still got to feed your critters.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:08):**  Yeah.  They need a little bit extra.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:12):**  I'm not saying that feeding ration is wrong.  And at the end – cattle were made.  Our country has resources.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:21):**  We can finish the cattle with what can be grown, what's growing.  You can.  You have pivots.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:27):**  Pivot.  You have a pivot.  You can make it rain whenever you want.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:33):**  Fair enough.  Anyway, we also have to make money.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:40):**  We go back to the economics of it.  Could I get my hogs fat like some people do only on forage?  Possibly but I would have them a long time.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:26:52):**  And you would probably have to have your own hogs that you've bred and developed to succeed  under that management.  And it seems like I've heard somewhere that you need to turn inventory a lot.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:27:09):**  And part of – that's another one of the appeals of the poultry industry that those  chickens show up and seven and a half weeks they're going in the freezer and they've  got those pens.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:27:22):**  You can turn that what, five, six times a year?  Well weather dependent of course.  If I wanted to do it all year long.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:27:32):**  During the growing season, each of my pens, I'll probably run about three different  groups.  You'll have three different batches through – I've got three pens and I'll probably  
**[0:27:41-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:27:41):**  run three different batches.  As soon as one pen is done, I'm pulling it back around and I've got another batch  coming out of the halfway house.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:27:51):**  The halfway house is one of my old stock trailers.  I wouldn't pull it a mile down the road but it works pretty good to put chicks on  right after they come out of the brooder.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:02):**  But anyway, another rabbit hole there.  Feeding the pigs.  The same thing.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:11):**  It speeds up the process so we're hanging the pigs on the rail at probably about seven  months on average which is a little bit longer than I think the confinement but quite a bit  less than if you're –  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:29):**  They're just eating your yard.  Your bacon tastes better than anything I could get in the store.  So whatever you're doing, keep doing it.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:36):**  We've done experiments with your bacon, Kurt.  Have I ever told you about this?  No.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:41):**  We –  Maybe you have but I forgot but I want to say no because I don't want to admit that  I ever forget anything.  
**[0:28:49-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:28:49):**  This was an interesting unplanned experiment.  We had bacon at home when we were cooking breakfast and I think I had two packages of  your bacon and then there was a package of some Smith's Field bacon in the fridge too  
**[0:29:01-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:01):**  and I cooked all three packages and we cooked one of yours and weighed it and cooked one  of the other ones and they started out the same weight.  I think it was three times the difference.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:12):**  So by the time I finished cooking the bacon, the finished product that started out the  same, your bacon weighed three times the amount finished Smith's Field product weighed.  Well, that's pretty cool.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:23):**  I thought it was pretty awesome.  And probably – how does it – looking at the fat.  I mean is there –  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:32):**  Well, I mean I've definitely gotten different bacon from you guys where there's more or  less fat content.  I got ends last time which I love by the way.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:40):**  Like some people don't like it but I love the bacon ends because they're so good.  We cut them up into chunks and fry those.  It's like –  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:46):**  It's so good.  I'm going to have to edit all that out.  So good.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:49):**  I'm going to have to edit all that out so we get all your bacon pieces.  Nobody else wants them.  So anyways, I don't know.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:29:59):**  Where were we going with that?  Your experiment, you weighed them.  You're getting ready to talk about how much weight is lost.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:05):**  Oh, he was asking about the fat content.  So I mean it definitely makes a difference but usually when I get bacon from you, it's  marbled.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:13):**  It's got some fat throughout it.  There's not like one big chunk of fat on one end.  So when it's done cooking, it still looks like a piece of bacon and there's just a  
**[0:30:21-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:21):**  lot more food left over.  Well, I thought you were going to bring up the experiment we did with ground beef.  We cooked up – I think it was – I can't remember if it was some of the – or some  
**[0:30:31-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:31):**  other grass-fed beef that we got.  But we cooked up, I think it was a 2.75-pound package that we got from the store and it  lost almost a pound.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:43):**  Like it was over 0.8 that it lost.  Like it weighed up to less than two pounds from two and three-quarters after we cooked  it.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:52):**  So it's like 60, 40.  Exactly.  It's supposed to be 80, 20 is what it was supposed to be.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:30:57):**  And then the grass-fed that we bought, it was all 85, 15 I think.  And the grass-fed that we cooked, it was 85, 15 lost like two ounces off two pounds.  I don't know.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:09):**  The bacon definitely – and at this point when we did the experiment, you could go to  the store and I could pay whatever you guys were charging for bacon and I could buy bacon  at the store for $3 a pound.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:19):**  And when it was done cooking, you figure it out pound by pound per ounce and it was still  way cheaper to buy your bacon with the end product and the value.  But nobody ever sees that.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:29):**  Nobody ever understands the end value of the product.  A lot of people just look the price tag.  They do.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:32):**  They do.  We were taught to because of our depression grandparents.  And there's a lot like I was saying with beef and with your pork, in those commodity  
**[0:31:40-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:40):**  products that you're going to find in a fancy, shiny label at the store, it seems  like there's just a heck of a lot of water that cooks out of that meat whether we're  talking about pork, beef or chicken.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:31:52):**  I know some people have done the same experiment with chicken where they've gotten pastured  poultry and cooked it and lost almost no weight versus grocery store chicken that loses 20,  30 percent of weight.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:32:04):**  So that really makes a difference and people can't just look at that price tag and tell  how much of food is actually there.  That's exactly right.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:32:16):**  Andy used to make that point with our whole chickens and the price of it.  So you might get a little bit of sticker shock.  When you look at the – we used to say one chicken would feed us.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:32:32):**  Our fam, well, those days are all – we roast two of them now and there's still hardly  any leftovers.  But it used to be you could have the one – the bigger chicken that might weigh five pounds,  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:32:48):**  those big roasters.  You eat the meat.  You prepare the thing.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:32:53):**  You roast it and you eat the meat off of it to get your meal.  And then you would have enough left that you could cook that carcass down then and you  could pull the rest of that meat off and make enchiladas or something if you want to do  
**[0:33:04-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:33:04):**  that.  And then you've got the broth where you combine the two and maybe you make a big pot of chicken  noodle soup that would get another two meals off.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:33:14):**  That's real depression-era type stuff right there.  So then you look at the price of that chicken then, but all of a sudden you've got – we'll  just say two meals out of it rather than the original one and the value still looks better.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:33:33):**  Looks much better.  Back to the bacon, another friend and I were having this discussion the other day.  Bacon out of all the cuts and not just us, but I think anywhere that anybody has, bacon  
**[0:33:52-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:33:52):**  is the one that every – if you get that wrong, that's what people are going to remember.  If you've got to get one thing right, it better be the bacon.  I agree.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:06):**  I've been trying to sell our friend Matt on your guys' bacon for a long time and  he still shops like a kid that was raised in the 70s and 80s and he goes to the store  and buys the cheapest things he can buy.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:16):**  I cooked the bacon ends when he was here last time over the holidays and he sold.  He's like going back to the store now.  He's finally sold.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:23):**  He needed to taste the bacon perfectly done, perfectly right.  He was sold on it now.  Cool.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:32):**  So pigs.  Pigs.  Yes.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:35):**  Then what, Kurt?  What happened next?  We thought, well, okay, we've done chickens.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:42):**  Can't be too hard to do turkeys.  Yeah, no.  What's the problem with turkeys, Kurt?  
**[0:34:52-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:34:52):**  How much time do we have, Brian?  All the time in the world.  I'll put turkeys and sheep in the same category.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:35:02):**  We've also tried sheep.  I was going to ask that.  Are turkeys like the sheep of birds?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:35:06):**  They're just looking for a place to die.  Now, let me start with some of the positives on the turkeys.  They are a wonderful animal to help train young kids on how to herd cattle because about  
**[0:35:24-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:35:24):**  15 or 20 turkeys, if you need them to go somewhere, the zigzag motion, like you do about back  and forth behind a group of cattle, you know, steering them, those type of stuff, they drive  just like cattle.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:35:41):**  I shouldn't say just like, but I mean, it was...  I've never heard that before.  I've never heard anybody compared to trying to drive turkeys or herd turkeys and it's  
**[0:35:52-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:35:52):**  like cattle.  We've got a picture of my oldest.  I'm not sure how old she is at the time.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:00):**  One of the problems we had with turkeys too is we thought, well, we'd rearrange the chickens.  We could rearrange the turkeys.  Yeah, no.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:07):**  They take off.  Once they get...  If you rearrange them when they're too small, they disappear in the weeds and a bird of  
**[0:36:16-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:16):**  a hawk or something or an owl is going to pick them off.  They don't have enough brain to know to come back like a chicken does?  Or they'll just gather up in the weeds somewhere and let a coon eat them at night.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:26):**  So you have to keep them...  So you grow them bigger before you start rearranging them.  For a while, I thought, well, hey, these are just staying with the chickens.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah, no.  That didn't work.  They did one year and I think that was a fluke.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:46):**  That's not the rule.  That was a fluke that happened with that group.  The next year, they took off and they ended up...  
**[0:36:55-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:36:55):**  There's a row of trees about a quarter mile from our house and there was about 50 turkeys  down there around this Catawba Grove.  I thought, oh, shit.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:06):**  So we got them out of the...  I took Allison with me, my oldest.  We got them kind of out of the trees and got them on the road and got them in one group.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:16):**  And I gave her the...  Pulled the rattle paddle out of the back of the pickup.  I said, just keep heading them towards the house.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:23):**  And in about 10 minutes, she had them walk back up the road and in the yard where they  needed to be.  That's awesome.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:30):**  Yeah, so luckily they got back so they could...  Oh, she did video and stuff like that.  Well, yeah.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:36):**  We got them home so they could shit all over our porch again that night.  That's another thing.  They would roost on our porch.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:45):**  Oh, that made me so mad.  I bet they're worse than the chickens.  They're probably huge.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:49):**  So we decided, okay, but turkeys sell.  Yeah, and they're not cheap.  No.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:37:57):**  I imagine if you have your turkeys timed to where you're harvesting in November, you're  getting a lot more of a premium than you are for anything else.  You know, it's funny you should mention that, Brian.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:10):**  We also thought, oh, people want...  They'll pay for the fresh turkeys.  And people say, yeah, we want a fresh...  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:17):**  We phrased it like, would you like...  Yeah, we want a fresh turkey.  And so we thought...  
**[0:38:23-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:23):**  So we timed it.  So the first year we did turkeys, we timed it so we'd have the turkeys...  Well, we started them way too soon, and these turkeys were huge.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:37):**  I think we got one of these turkeys.  The biggest one weighed 30 pounds, dressed.  Those were big turkeys.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:44):**  Gosh.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you, what we were using at that time for our chickens, this is before  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:51):**  we have our equipment now.  We had a turkey fryer that we were putting our chickens into scald.  And so I thought, well, it's a turkey fryer.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:38:59):**  It makes sense that we could scald our turkeys.  Sure.  You should be able to put a turkey in a turkey fryer, right?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:05):**  You used to be in the Navy.  I'm sure you're familiar with water displacement.  Yes.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:14):**  Go on.  A very large turkey put in a scalding pot, only we put it in...  I mean, all the water is supposed to scald it, just put out the...  
**[0:39:29-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:29):**  Just put out the fire.  Yeah.  So we went to plan B. We finally got these...  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:42):**  I think we only had 15 turkeys that first year.  We finally got them dressed.  I bet that was a long day, though.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:46):**  Oh, God, it was.  It was the same deal that tasted so good, we thought, okay, we've got to figure out  how to do this better.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:39:56):**  Actually, I think the year Allison brought them home might have been the next year or  year after that.  But somewhere around year three or four of turkeys, we started using the electric netting,  
**[0:40:08-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:40:08):**  poultry netting.  And that made a big difference.  And as much as I hate the phrase game changer, that's what it was.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:40:23):**  I had a way of...  I've used the old stock trailers for the turkeys to roost in, and then I could move it around  and I'd set that netting up and I'd give them a run about it and we'd move about once a...  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:40:36):**  I'd like to say once a week.  Sometimes a week had 14 days.  But anyway, when they ran out of...  
**[0:40:44-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:40:44):**  Sometimes my daily moves are three days.  Yes.  Anyway, they would get moved on some kind of a basis.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:40:55):**  And that worked good.  We did not do any turkeys this year, though.  That is one of the enterprise...  
**[0:41:03-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:03):**  There's several reasons.  But Andy went back to the classroom several years ago, and that by all means is where  she needs to be.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:13):**  But when we were processing the turkeys in the fall...  Oh, time out on this.  Another thing.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:20):**  Back to the...  People said, yeah, we want fresh...  You know what they were doing with their fresh turkeys?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:25):**  Putting them in the freezer.  Putting them in the freezer.  Putting them in the dang freezer.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:28):**  And we're like, well, we could freeze them.  And not do 15 all in one day.  In November, when it's 20 degrees.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:37):**  So we started changing our...  And you know what?  When we did them about five weeks sooner, they weren't near as big.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:47):**  But anyway, the timing worked out.  So when we needed to process turkeys, Andy was back in school.  And so I thought, well, I can do them.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:41:57):**  Of course, over a couple of days, I can do 15 or 20 turkeys by myself.  If you...  Chickens aren't any problem.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:10):**  Handling and getting them in the kill cone, et cetera, et cetera.  Because they're four or five pound bird.  A little bit more than that alive.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:19):**  The turkey...  Imagine picking up a feed sack and the feed sack's beating you with a set of wings trying  to get away from you.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:28):**  We had some big chicken.  The first three chickens I butchered this year weighed like 20 pounds a piece.  They were ridiculous huge.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:35):**  One person holding those chickens up.  One person holding those chickens up with a kill cone that was too small was a bad deal.  I can't even imagine what it was like with the turkey.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:43):**  So I was handling these turkeys and it was work.  Usually like the last...  I wouldn't do all of them.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:42:52):**  There'd usually be some that we'd do on a Friday or Saturday when I'd have some help.  And we got all of them done.  I had a little hiccup in the health department this year and we decided that sometimes all  
**[0:43:08-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:43:08):**  you can do is all you can do and there had to be some things that needed to not be done.  And that was one of the enterprises that we decided to not do.  But we carry...  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:43:23):**  Whenever we had...  One year I think we put over...  The most we did, one year we put...  
**[0:43:28-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:43:28):**  Wow, gosh, there's like 110 or 120 we put in the freezer.  And I think we had four or five that we carried over that we didn't sell by Christmas.  And the other remaining that we had, we went ahead and kicked those ourselves.  
**[0:43:49-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:43:49):**  I think we probably had somebody buy one or two later on.  We made them a deal on so we could move it.  The problem also, it's not like packages of meat that are square.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:00):**  Those things are round.  They're an awkward...  They don't stack.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:05):**  It's hard to get them stacked up in the freezer.  Take a lot of space up for sure.  Not something you wanna hold over for a long time.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:12):**  Right.  And so anyway, we hit...  I'll say we hit pause because Mrs. Dale might listen to this.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:21):**  I don't say we...  If we can figure out the logistics of hiring the processing done, we may very well...  And I could tweak my infrastructure a little bit more.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:41):**  We may very well.  You'll bring turkeys back sometime.  You bring up processing.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:46):**  I was gonna ask about that.  I haven't talked about help.  Do you guys have help?  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:52):**  Do you use help?  Do you hire people at all?  Or are all of these things that you guys have done been done with you and Andy and the kids  
**[0:44:58-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:44:58):**  and your family mostly?  We have some wonderful friends that help us out on processing day.  The husband will come over and he'll help out with the killing.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:08):**  And then his wife will come over and help out when we...  You'll put them in the freezer.  Whether we're putting the whole birds in or whether we're cutting up and putting parts  
**[0:45:18-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:18):**  in the freezer.  That's where the man hours really start stacking up.  And we've got...  
**[0:45:26-0:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:26):**  A lot of this stuff works really well right now because we've got two girls at home.  That was why I was going there.  Because I know that Allison's not at home.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:35):**  You guys have one less set of hands right now.  And has that affected...  Yeah.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:43):**  She left, but the youngest has stepped up and does a lot more.  My youngest girl...  All my daughters are good help.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:52):**  I've had a number...  We're getting off on another rabbit trail here.  Chase that rabbit.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:45:58):**  Well, I'm going to compliment my daughters.  I've had a number of teenage boys help me over the years.  Some of them have been awfully good hands.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:46:09):**  But I would put my daughters up against any of them in the work department.  I would second that with your girls and our girl and oftentimes girls in general.  Well, Allison and I could go out and move a group of cattle.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:46:24):**  We quit leading them with the Caker a long time ago.  Her and I could go out and herd the group.  And they stay paired up better if we're herding them rather than trying to lead them.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:46:35):**  So if you call them with a feed wagon, those cows will run off and leaf that calf wherever  he was.  If we're taking our time and herding them, every little bit they're stopping and bawling  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:46:48):**  and making sure that calf's with them.  It's when we're...  Especially if we're moving pairs across the road.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:46:55):**  But Allison had a way has because she helps me time to time when she comes home.  Anna is there too, my youngest.  My middle girl, she has a lot of gifts, handling livestock is not one of them.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:47:13):**  And so we found other places to utilize her.  That's fair.  I don't think everybody has it in them to be a great stockman or a patient stockman.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:47:25):**  He said last night to me, I don't think everybody's supposed to move cows.  No, no.  Some people do anyway, but they probably should.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:47:33):**  I agree with that also.  That is very true.  Anyway, my girls, you asked about the processing and I got sidetracked talking about the help  
**[0:47:45-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:47:45):**  but handling stock.  And anyway, they do a tremendous job of helping.  Whether we're moving cattle or moving chickens or whatever, those jobs, some of them are  
**[0:47:57-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:47:57):**  not their favorite, but I think it makes them...  I'm finding with my oldest that some of those nasty jobs that she did growing up like cleaning  out the brooder or stock trailer, they truly do build character and they give you a reference  
**[0:48:17-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:48:17):**  point for what else there is to do.  Processing day, yeah, we try to start early in the morning before it gets hot.  We get them chilled, we get them on ice.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:48:33):**  I say we usually will do groups.  For our setup, killing and getting in the chill tank, right around 100.  We've done 100.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:48:45):**  One time we did 150.  That was too many at one time.  Somewhere between 100 and 120 is about the top side of what we can...  
**[0:48:54-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:48:54):**  Five birds that we can... for how we're set up right now, what we can do.  And then usually we get those chilling on water and then in the afternoon then we'll  either... we'll package them up, get them in the freezer or we go ahead and get them  
**[0:49:13-0:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:13):**  cut up and get the parts vacuum sealed, labeled, et cetera, et cetera, and then in the walk-in  freezers.  We have it takes...  
**[0:49:27-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:27):**  And that's just poultry you're processing on site, right?  Yes.  Yes.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:33):**  If we're under a federal exemption where we can process, it's got feathers up to  a certain limit we can process and sell, we can deliver.  We're under federal exemption.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:45):**  There's a state exemption.  If you're under that, they have to pick it up on the farm.  I don't know why it all works the way it does.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:55):**  Food police.  Yeah, food police.  But it does.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:49:59):**  And so we try to dot our I's and cross the T's the best we can.  Processing we get... that's the normal processing day.  And then we... back-to-back days suck.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:16):**  Usually we usually... if we do a group on Monday, we try to not turn around and do another  group on Tuesday.  We try to maybe wait and do it on Wednesday.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:26):**  And I can see where... especially cutting that many birds up.  Andy, she goes fast cutting those things up.  She is scary fast with a very sharp knife.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:39):**  Stay out of her way.  Mental note.  But I can also see where carpal tunnel...  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:44):**  It's hard work.  It's super hard work cutting a chicken up is.  Consistently yes.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:50):**  I've tried it.  She cut her...  I think she has only cut her thumb once.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:50:55):**  And then I started... it was a couple years ago.  We had a lot of them to do that day.  And after I did like three of them, she's like, move over.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:06):**  She wrapped her thumb up and worked with like one hand, I think.  You're too slow, honey.  Sorry.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:12):**  I was terribly slow.  You know how to do something and you've got the muscle memory and it doesn't really matter  whether your thumb is bleeding or not.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:18):**  Just put a glove on and go away.  For the record, she did not bleed all of her product.  That's good.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:24):**  That's good.  Those birds are all gone by now anyway.  Everybody's fine.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:30):**  So we've talked about your chickens.  We've talked about the turkey experiment.  We've talked about pigs.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:38):**  We haven't even talked about sheep, goats or cows.  Goats – we'll have goats as long as my daughters have a 4-H project and that is about  as many goats as I care to have.  
**[0:51:52-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:51:52):**  We can keep goats in when they are on the smoker or in the freezer.  Sheep are a close second place in that.  Sheep are one of those things I thought, God, on paper and I even penciled out, you know,  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:52:11):**  we're going to start with this many.  We will keep this many.  We're going to inch it up.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:52:18):**  The hell of it is it takes as long to take care of 30 as it does 530.  I mean there's – if one does something, well, I probably – it's like a lot of  things.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:52:34):**  It goes back to management.  I thought I – and like also a lot of things, you can read all you want but the real learning  doesn't start until you get the critter on the place.  
**[0:52:49-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:52:49):**  That goes back to being humbled and nothing worked out like it's supposed to.  I mean they – they're supposed to be getting shocked and be terrified of that net.  They're not supposed to be running through it and tracking it all.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:53:02):**  They're supposed to be doing this and this.  But the book says when you hit that, it's going to hurt.  Why are you running through it?  
**[0:53:09-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:53:09):**  Didn't you read the book?  Well, we had them around for about two years and I decided that – well, also, in retrospect,  if I still had them, probably we would direct market a small percentage of them because  
**[0:53:29-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:53:29):**  the amount of meat that you get from live weight of a lamb carcass is really pretty  low.  It's like 25 percent of the live weight.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:53:41):**  So then you look at an almost 300-pound lambs bringing – or almost 100-pound lambs bringing  almost $300 live weight and then you figure what – you would have to pay for processing,  get them to the processor and then what that pencils out to on a per pound price and then  
**[0:53:59-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:53:59):**  you're comparing that to – then you look at that per pound price.  Now, it's not necessarily apples to apples but it's back to the sticker shock.  You look at a pound of ground beef versus a pound of ground lamb and – or a tiny little  
**[0:54:16-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:54:16):**  package of lamb chops compared to a ribeye steak.  And the money you'd need to make it worth your time to handle that, it was going to  be a hard sell.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:54:28):**  I mean I love – as far as eating it, a properly prepared lamb chop is very pleasing to the  palate I think.  My daughter makes fun of me because she has heard this speech a lot of times.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:54:43):**  Anyway, and we did not – we weren't moving as much lamb as we thought we would.  You were trying to sell it processed.  Like you were trying to sell cuts or you were trying to sell a carcass?  
**[0:54:56-0:55:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:54:56):**  We thought we'd be able to sell cuts.  We thought we'd be able – it was – we thought this is something that's different.  Certain places we'd really be able to move the cuts.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:06):**  Before you go on, when did you guys have – what year were you guys doing sheep in or round  about anyways?  I think it was about five years ago.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:14):**  Four or five years ago we got the first – 16, 15, 16, 17, something like that.  I'll tell you when it was.  It was when my – I remember this because this was – I stopped to watch – my daughter  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:28):**  played softball her senior year.  Okay.  I went to get these sheep and I was going to watch her softball game on the way home  
**[0:55:35-0:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:35):**  from getting the sheep and I was supposed to watch a double header.  Well, I had pickup problems and I can only drive my pickup about 50 mile an hour on the  way home from getting the sheep.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:43):**  I ended up having to leave the pickup and another guy let me use his pickup to go on  home and I stopped.  So, that would have been 2018.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:55:53):**  It's three years ago.  Okay.  Is that – no, it's – yeah, it's 2019.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:01):**  So it's three or four years ago I think.  So it seems like a lot longer but it was – Well, COVID has changed the way a lot of things  work in general like as far as marketing goes.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:09):**  That's why I was asking because I think probably even now sheep would maybe look different  than they would have two or three years ago but everything looked different in 2018 than  it does in 2022.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:18):**  Oh, you know, we used to be able to also if we ended up with, you know, something – an  extra animal or something we call the processor and say, hey, can you fit – if I bring extra  animal – Bring seven instead of five.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:35):**  Can you do an extra?  Yeah, there's none of that in how I've been.  Yeah, that's probably going to be a no today.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:39):**  Yeah, it's probably going to be a no today.  Forever.  A year from now.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:43):**  Right.  So that's another discussion we just about touched on.  Anyway, you know, processing dates, being able to just call up and get something in  
**[0:56:53-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:56:53):**  to hurry is – that doesn't happen anymore.  Yeah.  I just sorted off 12 yesterday that I found a buyer for and somebody was asking me yesterday,  
**[0:57:04-0:57:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:04):**  well, why don't you just throw one in the grinder?  Like, okay, find somewhere for me to take one on five days notice.  Like that's just not going to happen.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:14):**  No, you'd probably just as soon build your own processing plant to be completely honest  at this point.  I looked – they have this thing called a – is it a plant in the box processing?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:24):**  I can't remember who's putting it out.  They're not cheap.  That sounds pretty cool.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:29):**  I don't know.  I have guys out in Colorado that are like, I can cut an oak up.  I'll come out and cut your cow up on your –  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:33):**  Well, that –  Just string it up with a bale feeder and –  Well, that's what they do with elk.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:38):**  A bale bed and –  We've processed – we've done like a little party deal.  We've processed a hog on the farm when we cooked.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:45):**  And if it stays on the farm or if you sell a live animal to somebody and they buy that  live animal, sure, they can go ahead and do that on the farm.  But you can't –  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:57:55):**  Can't sell it.  Sell in those cuts.  Right, right, right.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:00):**  I don't know whether it's right or wrong, but right now that's the law of the land.  Yeah, for sure, for sure.  So no, we – and why – you know, we can do – but it's OK to do birds.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:18):**  Yeah, I mean I didn't even think about going down that path.  Why can't you do a bird just because it's smaller than a cow?  I don't know, but –  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:26):**  There's probably a reason.  I don't know if there's a good reason, but there probably is a reason.  There's definitely no good reason.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:30):**  There's no good reason for any of it.  Now I will also say this.  Handling the birds is much easier than handling, you know, a beef carcass.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:37):**  And the waste from it.  And that may very well be a big part of it too.  Well, you don't have to be a very big person to manhandle around a six-pound chicken, but  
**[0:58:47-0:59:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:58:47):**  you got to be a big guy to manhandle around a beef carcass, even a quarter.  Even a small one, yes, even a small one.  So sheep, are we doing sheep anymore or is that –  
**[0:59:02-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:59:02):**  No.  So I sold some of the bread to use, at least I assumed they were bread, and then sold the  feeder lambs a year ago in December.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:59:14):**  So we don't have the sheep anymore, but we do still have three very large livestock  guardian dogs, two of which the girls raised from when they were very, very, very small.  And so three dogs, guardian dogs is too many.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:59:30):**  They're a little underemployed.  They make good pets too when they're cute.  They grow out of being cute.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:59:41):**  They're good dogs, so they probably chase the cars.  My neighbors will listen to that.  They would disagree when they chase the cars like crazy.  
**[0:59:48-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=0:59:48):**  But anyway, I can't imagine, you know, the three are going to be here.  They'll die on the place.  And which is right.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:02):**  Yeah.  They're pretty easy keepers anyway, I imagine.  Well, you could feed a potload of cattle cheaper and you can feed these three big dogs.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:08):**  Well, yeah, they aren't cheap to feed, but they are easy.  They are easy to – I mean, I've had dogs, had a lot of dogs, and she drags crap around  and she eats a lot of food, but she's not – but like Brian said, she's really trainable  
**[1:00:20-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:20):**  and she's smarter.  She's an easy keeper.  She just eats a lot.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:23):**  She doesn't jump on people.  This is back to them being smart too.  Just a few times I saw this with these guardian dogs.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:32):**  I thought that dadgum things – I think you and I, Tony, have talked about that.  They've had a dead animal and I thought, well, they've killed a chicken.  Yeah, I will tell the story if you want to hear it.  
**[1:00:43-1:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:00:43):**  And I think you go – I think the dogs, I think they dispose of – if one of their  – what they're guarding disappears or dies, I think they dispose of what's left so it  does not attract another varmint.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:03):**  I agree completely.  I've heard it from another sheep person before I ever met you or had the dogs.  I've heard wind of it before.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:10):**  So what happened with us is we'd been losing some animals and I came outside one morning  and Lily is laying in the front yard chewing on a chicken, obviously dead chicken.  And I was like, you can't eat the chicken.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:23):**  This is your job.  You're supposed to guard the chickens.  What the hell?  
**[1:01:26-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:26):**  So I yelled at her.  I did.  I was like – I yelled at her.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:29):**  I got onto her.  I took the chicken and I hauled it off.  I was so upset because I was worried.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:34):**  I mean I was going to have to get rid of her.  Like she's eating my chickens.  What am I going to do?  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:38):**  And I did.  I called Kurt and I text Kurt and I was like, Lily's eating the chickens.  What are we going to do?  
**[1:01:43-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:43):**  And he said, well, are you sure she's eating the chickens?  And I said, yeah, she was eating chickens.  He said, are you sure the chicken wasn't dead already?  
**[1:01:50-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:50):**  And I thought, well, no, surely the chicken wasn't dead already.  So the next day, we end up having a chicken come out of the coop and it was injured when  it came out of the coop.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:01:59):**  And the chicken needed to be put down.  I had gone out in my robe and let the animals out.  The chicken came out and it was kind of going around in circles in the yard.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:07):**  I needed to go inside and put some shoes on and get dressed so that I could take care  of the chicken.  And when I come back out, the chicken is nowhere to be found.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:13):**  I look all over the yard.  The chicken is nowhere.  I go back out a couple of hours later and Lily has the chicken in the front yard.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:20):**  But it had been mutilated and mauled at some point somehow.  So over the course of the next several days, I watched her and I sat out in the yard and  watched her lay around in the middle of the yard with chickens.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:30):**  Our other dogs would chase the chickens and run through them.  Chickens would run around and she just laid there.  Never once did she touch one of them.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:37):**  So what we kind of found, figured out or think happened is that there's definitely been a  coyote and probably we have some Mississippi kites and we also have a couple owls that  live where they come around during the day.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:49):**  We had the chicken that was hurt in the middle of the yard.  It probably bird came down and got it and Lily hauled it off and was chewing it up and  she she's had some really good meals lately.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:02:57):**  I think she's chased the coyote off probably a couple of times and got the chicken from  him.  Um, but that's, that's absolutely what she's doing because she, she won't hurt them.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:05):**  She doesn't chase him.  She doesn't play with them.  She doesn't get after them ever.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:09):**  But as soon as there's one dead in the yard, she goes and gets it and she hauls it away  from the house or right up to the front yard.  So it's either a long ways from the house or right in front of the yard where we can  
**[1:03:18-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:18):**  see her with it and eats it and gets rid of it and there's never any guts left.  Yep.  Is that what they're supposed to do?  
**[1:03:26-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:26):**  Makes sense to me.  I think so.  I think it's part of the 20,000 years of breeding that's in those animals that you know what  
**[1:03:35-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:35):**  they do.  I mean even like after birth and things like that, I would imagine that if there was a  mess left, even with cows to help keep that mess cleaned up would keep predators away.  
**[1:03:45-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:03:45):**  I've seen some of those stories that livestock guardian dogs, Pyrenees and Anatolians will  go up like when they're with cows or when they're with sheep and goats that they will  go take care of the afterbirth and clean things up and watch the mother.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:01):**  Now you're probably going to have somebody that knows far more about guardian dogs chime  in.  I'm sure I'll get tons of hate mail for it.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:10):**  And let you know everything that I've said is probably wrong.  Wrong or not, it's what we've experienced.  I've been really surprised and I've been really surprised watching her from the time we got  
**[1:04:23-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:23):**  her.  We put her in with the chickens at night and they're not her people.  We're her people.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:27):**  She stays on the front porch and she watches us but she knows those chickens are ours.  If there's not stock around, I think you're right, the dogs then your plan B is the people  that take care of them then are what they guard.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:45):**  I think that's why our dogs chase cars so bad is that we keep our chickens run north  of the road from where our house is.  And I think the dogs recognize the road that runs in front of our house is part of what  
**[1:04:59-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:04:59):**  they're supposed to be guarding.  And every car that comes through there is a threat.  All night long, every time Lily hears a car, when she hears a car because our house isn't  
**[1:05:08-1:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:05:08):**  too far from the road either, it stirs her up too.  You could be standing right by those dogs.  If you want them to do something or doing something you don't want to on a perfectly  
**[1:05:19-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:05:19):**  calm afternoon and you yell at them at the top of your lungs, they'll act like they don't  hear you.  We could have a 30 mile an hour wind and a coon could fart a half mile away.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:05:34):**  Yep.  And they're barking.  It's been interesting because we have Aussies.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:05:40):**  We've had Aussies for a long time.  Brian had a healer when I met him and I have a golden retriever.  And in the past I've had a Husky.  
**[1:05:50-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:05:50):**  And having Lily has been much more akin to having Sam to having the healer and to having  Husky than it is to having the Aussies because they have a much more stubborn work dog type  demeanor where my Aussies are happy dopey people pleasers.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:04):**  They're independent and they're definitely their own creature and they want to do their  job but they have their own mind for sure.  Takes a different kind of owner.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:15):**  You have to be a stern leader with them.  And you have to be smarter than a dog and I think that's my shortfall.  Well I mean.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:23):**  That's usually my shortfall.  Probably all of our shortfalls with a dog most of the time.  And with cows.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:29):**  I understand that.  Do you want to talk about your cows?  I love talking about cattle.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:37):**  We've been here for an hour and haven't even talked about your cows yet.  We've hardly touched on them yet have we?  We've got a cow calf operation and I do some custom grazing.  
**[1:06:50-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:06:50):**  Part of the cow calf deal we switched to a fall calving herd.  You all fall?  Or do you have any spring summer calvers left?  
**[1:07:04-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:07:04):**  I have spring and summer calvers when I buy something that might calve in the spring or  summer.  But you're transitioning everything to fall?  
**[1:07:13-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:07:13):**  Yes, I've transitioned to fall.  So not on purpose.  I fall on purpose but from time to time there are wonderful buying opportunities to buy  
**[1:07:23-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:07:23):**  something that's bred to calve in the spring and then that works real well to get that  calf off of her and then depending on that's kind of like a coupon and then you can you  know that's a if you know the ranch that female comes off of you know that that works out  
**[1:07:44-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:07:44):**  real well then hang that animal on the rail or you put her in your or I'll slip her into  the fall calving herd.  So there's some good buyback opportunities you know with the fall calving herd I guess.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:07:59):**  So everything that I have right now that's on purpose is you know for the fall calving  herd yes and plus that suits my grazing the crop residues.  I can have enough quality forage in front of them in terms of a fall seeded annual with  
**[1:08:23-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:08:23):**  this goes back to the irrigation.  That I can make sure I've got the right quality groceries to have them so I can have a good  breed back even turning the bull out in December.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:08:38):**  And also I don't have 1,500 pound cows.  I have you've seen my cows there 1,000, 1,100 pounds probably you know on the top side.  Well I know exactly what bull you picked to put on them this year.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:08:54):**  On one group of them yes.  Anyway that has worked real well for me and we used to calve when I first moved back we  calved and started calving the 19th of January.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:09:09):**  I don't know why that date sticks in my head but it does.  And we did that for a couple of years.  It's cold in January like do you know that?  
**[1:09:19-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:09:19):**  By God that's what you do.  That's what you did.  I mean when I was even in high school I remember that's what everybody did.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:09:25):**  And so then I started moving it back to March.  Well that's a little bit better but you know you're still.  And then I went ahead and moved it back and we started you know when we were calving in  
**[1:09:37-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:09:37):**  the spring I wouldn't start until the middle of April.  And that was just that for the spring calving herd that's a good time.  You know May not too many calves will freeze to death in May in our country.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:09:56):**  Not very often.  I don't think I've ever seen even one freeze to death or even heard of one freezing to  death in May.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:10:02):**  Maybe in June but not in May.  This May, don't say that.  This could be the year.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:10:11):**  Now anyway so I moved back to spring so that was me dabbling with doing things a little  bit different.  And that was the moving to the fall calving actually had more to do with opportunities  
**[1:10:29-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:10:29):**  with the direct market.  If I wasn't doing any of the direct marketing and I was just running you know cow calf I  would probably still be calving.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:10:38):**  The bulk of my calves would come in late April and May.  The economics of hanging animals on the rail and you know when those animals you know turn  up open at preg check and that you know if they turn up so we you know now maybe we preg  
**[1:10:55-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:10:55):**  check in April and May that's right at the start of when our you know green groceries  are showing up.  Those younger animals turn up open they slide into the butcher beef deal and I'm not wintering  
**[1:11:07-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:11:07):**  them before I put them in the butcher beef deal.  They've turned up in April May and so you know they're you know they just get well that  makes sense.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:11:16):**  They just yeah they get they just get shifted into a different program and you know everybody  weans a calf or they you know find a different way to contribute you know dollars to the  ranch in the bottom line.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:11:28):**  That's a good way to look at it rather than everybody makes a calf or everybody gets on  the Jesus bus everybody gets a calf or everybody finds another way to contribute.  So anyway that's that was part of the economics going into the fall calving herd.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:11:42):**  And then also then you know if you try to maintain your numbers then you want to buy  back something that's bred you know you know some of the guys that do like to calve in  January they have calves that freeze to death and so if there's also opportunities if you  
**[1:11:58-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:11:58):**  don't have your enough home raised animals you could go buy a two-year-old heifer that  just lost a calf and slide her into the butcher beef program too.  You usually get those bought you know pretty reasonable.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:12:10):**  Or a lot cheaper than you can buy a steer a lot of times.  Or you could buy something that was bred out of sync for another ranch and you could buy  a heavy springer you know about that time you know and she might show up calving awfully  
**[1:12:24-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:12:24):**  early for your you know fall herd and you know real but it ends up being a pretty good  buy so.  And you only have to push those you know those spring summer bred animals a couple of months  
**[1:12:34-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:12:34):**  down the fall rather than trying to rather than trying to get all the way through the  dormant dry season on feed before you're trying to re-breed.  Correct.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:12:43):**  So anyway that's that's one of the pieces of the puzzle there.  Along with the cows before we ever started direct marketing a guy by the name of Lauren  Graff used to be.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:12:58):**  I remember Lauren.  He is a good hand.  He helped me get set up with rotational grazing.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:04):**  I remember Lauren when he worked with Ruth Timmons still.  Okay.  We don't time it though.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:12):**  We strung you know we ran some water line you know wow we're up to about eight paddocks  now.  Back in the 90s that was a good place to be.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:24):**  Eight was better than four.  Four is better than two.  So we've I'm not sure what we have.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:31):**  I don't know that I could put a number on it now because we subdivide within the paddocks  and so the actual number of paddocks is kind of irrelevant.  I know how that feels.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:43):**  Over 90 permanent paddocks and like after that it's just it doesn't matter.  Well I'm nowhere near that but I it's a different scale.  But anyway.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:13:52):**  I have to be three different herds.  It's kind of like three different ranches so.  Yeah anyway so we started to rotation and you know and then you go back to what I started  
**[1:14:04-1:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:14:04):**  talked about earlier you know with the equipment.  When we started as we moved into the direct marketing I started unloading some of the  farm equipment.  
**[1:14:14-1:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:14:14):**  You know it used to be quite a bit of swathing and baling too.  And so some of those acre when I discovered when we were subdividing the big pastures  light bulb went off when I started realizing also when you started handling the cattle  
**[1:14:30-1:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:14:30):**  mower moving them they started seeing you more than just when you're doing something  to them.  And all of a sudden disposition wasn't you know we're a lot better now than we were  
**[1:14:43-1:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:14:43):**  then but we you know we started I started seeing improvements you know handling the  cattle mower regularly.  And I started paying attention to guys like I hate to mention too many names because I'll  
**[1:14:56-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:14:56):**  leave somebody out but.  I know how that feels too.  Early on anything that you know Walt Davis wrote you know I would who made a trip to  
**[1:15:10-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:10):**  Hutchinson visited Ken King.  I tell you talk about a gold Jaco Farms a very gracious individual.  He is so willing to share his knowledge and his son's the same way.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:26):**  They're just.  What's his son's name?  Ben?  
**[1:15:29-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:29):**  Daniel.  Daniel.  I'm pretty sure Daniel's on my list to get on the podcast I just haven't seen that  
**[1:15:36-1:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:36):**  particular list in a while but yeah Daniel King.  Yes.  Future guest on the Ranching Reboot podcast.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:41):**  He would be a good.  Anyway he.  The late Terry Gompert I listened to him.  
**[1:15:51-1:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:15:51):**  Neighbor and I went out to Colorado and listened to Ian Mitchell lines and let's just say  I hate to keep you know I'm gonna leave somebody there's a lot of you know more a lot more  people I pick brains now but early on you know these were people are really kind of.  
**[1:16:13-1:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:16:13):**  10 or 15 years ago it was pretty slim pickings.  Yes anyway so I thought well what if we start you know grazing some of our farm ground besides  you know the first step was grazing the Dorman alfalfa in the wintertime.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:16:28):**  That's almost heretical.  Well then we.  And what I would just I just put the hot wire around you know a lot of it just turn them  
**[1:16:38-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:16:38):**  out and you know I'd let him go for a while then end up I was hauling feed to him you  know like well that didn't last near as long as I thought it should and then.  That advanced into more paddocks and rotating them a little bit and then.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:16:59):**  After listening and reading some of Greg Judy stuff I really started getting into thinking  about I'm a I'm a thick-headed slow learner I mean thick thick thick headed and I I learned  very very slow it takes me a long time.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:17:14):**  I don't think that's true.  I don't think that's fair to say about yourself and I don't know your wife your wife might  agree with that because she lives with you but you figured some things out here that  
**[1:17:23-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:17:23):**  a lot of people aren't even considering yet.  We moved so I moved into the the higher density grazing and that really started opening my  eyes up to what a number you know you get a certain level you was Brian you said before  
**[1:17:42-1:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:17:42):**  the magic starts to happen in the soil once you start getting above you know fifty thousand  I think you get up over a hundred thousand.  I think I said twenty five thousand pounds an acre.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:17:52):**  Maybe you did.  You probably did.  I'm not.  
**[1:17:55-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:17:55):**  I'm pretty sure that's what I said because I was there when I said it.  That doesn't remember you.  That doesn't mean you remember.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:18:03):**  Well when I tell the story I say fifty but I'm gonna have to from now on I'll say twenty  five.  Fifty thousand pounds an acre in our environment will drive things in a hurry.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:18:14):**  Yes.  Well my daily moves I gave maybe where I got the fifty thousand is when I graze my winter  stockpile if I'm only moving once a day I'm about fifty thousand.  
**[1:18:27-1:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:18:27):**  I think that's about right.  I have found when I move twice a day and get up around a hundred thousand they would I  would have to give I could give them twenty or thirty percent less forage to get there  
**[1:18:45-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:18:45):**  get the same you know.  Just by moving in one extra time.  Yes.  
**[1:18:52-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:18:52):**  So I do I take that and go you'll however many more times a day.  Well maybe I could but there's also other things I have to do and it wasn't always practical  to move them twice a day.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:19:06):**  And then I ran into the dry weather and calves not staying in and I needed that.  But I there was very little left on the stockpile I was on when I ran into the fencing issues  and move the move the pairs off of that this year.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:19:22):**  And anyway we we progressed into the much higher density grazing and I don't do that  all the time.  I'm I don't know if targeted is the right word.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:19:39):**  If there's in certain places.  I think there's a lot of words being floated around like targeted grazing or managed grazing  that that we're not all we're all speaking the same language.  
**[1:19:52-1:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:19:52):**  Okay let me phrase it this way.  It didn't always work for me to do it all the time in every place.  Some places it works better than other places.  
**[1:20:01-1:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:01):**  I think that's another one of those things that people make a lot of assumptions of.  We talked about that when he was when he was doing a lot of grazing with the Coriannaise  to begin with that people see you moving your cows every day or every two days and they  
**[1:20:14-1:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:14):**  think you're doing that with every animal you have every day or in your whole place.  That's not feasible.  No.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:21):**  There's a time and there's a time of year where it works really well to move every day  and there's a time of year where you need to slow down so you have enough rest for the  rest of your paddocks.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:34):**  And I'll say this you know I've I've talked a lot about Coriannaise and strip grazing  and high stock density.  I can't do that on the whole ranch.  
**[1:20:43-1:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:43):**  Like you've ridden around you've ridden around it with me Kurt.  You know it's rough.  Like some of those canyons you're just not going to I'm not going to go down there  
**[1:20:51-1:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:51):**  with a polly wire and come back up.  I'm not going to do that four times a day.  I'm just not that guy.  
**[1:20:56-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:20:56):**  No.  I would be impressed if you could.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:21:01):**  I'm not doing it though.  Where I have when I say when I use the phrase targeted I try when I do the higher density  grazing it's on the acres that I'll get the most bang for my buck.  
**[1:21:17-1:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:21:17):**  And where I'll get the most regrowth.  That's usually on my crop ground.  The better crop ground that depending on what's going to be growing next or if it's on my  
**[1:21:29-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:21:29):**  native range it's on the sub irrigated stuff that I know even in a dry year.  You're going to have some good production.  The production is going to be good and it makes and if I don't get a lot of that production  
**[1:21:43-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:21:43):**  knocked down it's not going to be I'm not going to get near the value use out of it.  And so I'll knock it down and then I also get you'll better regrowth.  Right.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:21:54):**  And that's and my country is nowhere near as rough as yours but there are certain places  that it's just easier to turn them in there and let them be there for three to five days.  You'll lose your stock.  
**[1:22:10-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:22:10):**  And you also you have to you'll look at what you have going on.  I have to do this this this on certain days.  I can stick them in this paddock and there's no doubt they'll have water.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:22:24):**  Sort of bring another set of 200 up to the pens and sort them and work the calves and  work the cows.  So you have a basketball tournament or you have track at state track you have kids you  
**[1:22:32-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:22:32):**  have a family life and when you have the ability to make plans like that it definitely works  better especially when you don't have help.  There's a lot of pieces there's always a lot of moving parts that's exactly right.  
**[1:22:43-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:22:43):**  So I think that's the nature of our business.  It's like sometimes I feel like a juggler that you're just trying to juggle all these  moving parts and all of these projects that have their own schedule that can change with  
**[1:22:56-1:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:22:56):**  no notice.  Yes and like a lot of moving parts you have more opportunity for breakdown.  And sometimes I remember working my equipment as a kid we needed a certain tool to fix a  
**[1:23:11-1:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:23:11):**  certain piece of machinery to fix the piece of machinery that broke down.  You spend half a day getting the machinery you need to fix the other machine.  After a while you're like now what were we originally fixing?  
**[1:23:24-1:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:23:24):**  Sometimes life's like that isn't it?  Yeah I've done that more than once.  It starts as a simple job.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:23:34):**  Every simple job on the farm or ranch is one oops or one ah crap away from three more trips  to town and two more things you got to fix in order to do one simple little job that  should take five minutes.  
**[1:23:46-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:23:46):**  Yeah Roger that.  They always say like every job is one broken bolt away from being a weekend you know an  all weekend deal kind of one of those things.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:23:59):**  So sometimes I look at a can of worms on the ranch it's like four o'clock on a Friday I'm  like it'll wait till Monday.  Yep yep that's exactly right.  
**[1:24:11-1:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:24:11):**  I think that's kind of a big part of the puzzle that doesn't get talked about in our world  a lot is the juggling of all pieces and how you do that and whether or not you have the  ability to look at that mess on Friday when you have a track meet to go to and say it'll  
**[1:24:27-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:24:27):**  wait till Monday and to put it on to put it on the back burner and put your family and  all of the things that may not seem like the top priority in the moment but really are  in the long run ahead of that rat's nest.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:24:41):**  Yep yep and there are some things that have to be taken care of I mean if you've got cattle  out on the road that doesn't wait you probably better not let that wait.  You don't get to go to a volleyball game instead of getting cows off the highway.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:24:54):**  I don't know how many times I've you know turned around and you'll put the work clothes  back on and gather cattle and you'll fix fence and then went to do whatever.  That's one of the and sometimes that's not a management deal that's just you know that's  
**[1:25:12-1:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:25:12):**  a deer knocking the fence down.  That's light I mean it's like that's not having a nine to five job.  Yeah so.  
**[1:25:18-1:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:25:18):**  I think that's part of your you know part of this part of working in ag in general your  family gets to understand you can't be there for all of those things and they appreciate  it extra special when you are and even when you aren't sometimes they bring the flat version  
**[1:25:32-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:25:32):**  of you along when you can't make it.  Yeah flat version doesn't eat near as much.  I bet the flat version of Kurt does not eat near as much.  
**[1:25:41-1:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:25:41):**  Okay so one of the two of you is going to have to tell our listeners what we're talking  about when we're saying flat Kurt.  Flat Kurt.  
**[1:25:48-1:26:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:25:48):**  Well there's been two different times that I was supposed to go on a trip and I haven't  been able to.  The first time a couple years ago is over Christmas break Andy and the girls and I were  
**[1:26:03-1:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:26:03):**  going to go down Oklahoma City and do we spent a few days down there and right about the  time we were getting ready to leave I had calves start getting sick and I mean it was  I don't know how many calves I was doctoring today and I couldn't figure out what the  
**[1:26:23-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:26:23):**  problem was but I was checking them two or three times a day and it's not one of those  things if it's just a matter of putting the bail out you can ask the neighbor to  come over and take care of the stock for a couple days but those type of things I was  
**[1:26:39-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:26:39):**  not going to go four hours away and be able to relax.  I can understand that.  Luckily my bride understood that as well but and the girls did too to some extent we're  
**[1:26:53-1:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:26:53):**  like well we still want you to go along so they printed out a picture of me.  It was not life-size.  I'm not going to admit it.  
**[1:27:02-1:27:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:02):**  But it's –  close enough.  That is awesome.  
**[1:27:05-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:05):**  And they put it on a stick and so they had flat curt that they carried along this picture  of me.  We went ice skating with them.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:11):**  That's the only way I'm going ice skating.  Karen damn Tia.  It was the best thing.  
**[1:27:17-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:17):**  Like our whole entire community got to watch flat curt go on this adventure with his family  and it was hilarious.  It was great.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:24):**  So that was the first step.  Well flat curt didn't get thrown away.  He got stuck in a closet somewhere.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:30):**  This fall we were all supposed to go to – up to Manhattan to go to a K-State football game  and he had an Airbnb, you know, nice little deal set up close to the stadium, et cetera,  et cetera.  
**[1:27:42-1:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:42):**  Our daughter is up there.  We're going to have to do that.  Maybe we'll just ride along with you because we have a daughter up there too now.  
**[1:27:49-1:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:49):**  Oh okay.  I thought you meant you were going to take flat curt along somewhere.  Well we'll take flat curt.  
**[1:27:53-1:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:27:53):**  Well we could take flat curt.  Well anyway … We might just get a flat curt and a flat Brian and send them around the  world.  
**[1:28:00-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:28:00):**  Then you and I can just never leave the ranch and stay with our cows.  Well, there's some medicine that I'm on that I had some complications with that resulted  in a case of pancreatitis and that was miserable.  
**[1:28:18-1:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:28:18):**  And so this was right before we were getting ready to go up there.  And Andy and the girls were like, do you think you can still go along and just … My diet  for the next three or four days was going to consist of water and jello and no alcohol.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:28:41):**  And so I thought …  It doesn't sound like a terribly fun K-State football weekend.  I couldn't picture myself … Plus I was finally starting to be able to get comfortable  
**[1:28:58-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:28:58):**  and tolerate the pain but I wasn't in any condition to travel anywhere.  And I probably should have been in the hospital to start with but I crawled in the pickup  and delivered a set of hogs to the processor and …  
**[1:29:09-1:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:29:09):**  But you're stubborn so you didn't go there, right?  Not at first.  This is the main appointment and I stopped on the way home but that's another subject.  
**[1:29:21-1:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:29:21):**  Anyway, that was … Flatkirt made that trip so I stayed home.  Your family is awesome.  I just think that's the coolest thing.  
**[1:29:28-1:29:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:29:28):**  It was really cool to see them do that and have fun and be able to include you even though  you couldn't be there.  I have a slightly relatable story that I can tell that I don't think I've ever told.  
**[1:29:38-1:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:29:38):**  Fire away.  So, it was just over 20 years ago, I was in the Navy and I was leaving on my first deployment  for the very first time and my mother was getting married, remarried.  
**[1:29:54-1:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:29:54):**  And of course, I can't go to the wedding because I'm on this med cruise.  So, about two months into this med cruise is when the wedding was and kind of similar  to what they did for you, she printed out a life-size, literal six-foot tall version  
**[1:30:10-1:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:10):**  of me in black and white.  And my cousin Mike took it upon himself that it was his job to make sure that Flat Brian  was in all of the family pictures.  
**[1:30:20-1:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:20):**  So in all of the wedding pictures, somewhere I'm hiding in the background or in the back  row as Flat Brian.  I didn't know this story.  
**[1:30:29-1:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:29):**  Yeah.  You'll have to see some of these pictures.  Like I said, I didn't think I've ever told that story and maybe not even in your presence,  
**[1:30:35-1:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:35):**  but yeah, you'll have to ask mom for those pictures next time we're out there visiting.  You mentioned my family.  I tell people I married a much better person than my wife did.  
**[1:30:48-1:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:48):**  She used to disagree with me, but not anymore.  She just says, yes, you did.  I'm on that bus.  
**[1:30:55-1:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:30:55):**  I'll get a ticket on that bus with you, buddy.  On the bus, the Andy is much better than he is?  No, that he married a wife much better than his wife married.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:07):**  I don't know how to say that.  Wow.  Let's move on, please.  
**[1:31:14-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:14):**  So what kind of cows do you have?  We talked about it, but like.  Predominantly Angus.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:20):**  I'm not opposed to her.  My youngest daughter, she has 4-H efforts.  She loves Hereford's.  
**[1:31:27-1:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:27):**  Growing up, we had Hereford's, that's what my grandpa bought years and years ago.  And we had those and then dad started crossbreeding in the 80s.  Frame size like everybody else, way too big, then probably back small.  
**[1:31:46-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:46):**  You probably started going back small before a lot of other people did.  Quite possibly.  Well, and small now for a lot of other people is on the bigger side for me, so I guess that's  
**[1:31:58-1:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:31:58):**  relative to her.  What do you call them small?  You said 9 to 11 is what you want to cow?  
**[1:32:04-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:32:04):**  Yes.  I think that's a perfectly fine size for Red Hills range cows, 9 to 11.  It's a very doable size to get by on a given set of resources with minimal inputs and still  
**[1:32:17-1:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:32:17):**  produce a product that sells good in the commodity market.  So if your cows are around 11, 9 to 11 let's say, what are your steers on the rail?  I don't butcher a lot.  
**[1:32:31-1:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:32:31):**  We don't, on our butcher beef deal, we don't butcher a lot of our steers.  It's primarily heifers.  But we can still hang about an 11 to 1,200 pound animal on the rail.  
**[1:32:46-1:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:32:46):**  The steers that I have kept when you keep them and you get, when they get just a little  bit older, I can still hang a 12 or 1,300 pound steer.  The heifers…  
**[1:32:58-1:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:32:58):**  Like around what, 26, 24, 26 months?  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[1:33:03-1:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:03):**  Yeah.  Yeah, probably every bit of 26 months.  Probably less than 30, but probably right around 26, like you said, yes.  
**[1:33:18-1:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:18):**  When we were calving in April and May, they'd be two-year-olds in May and then you're  hanging them on the rail in June, July, August, somewhere in there depending on what kind  of groceries they're coming off of.  
**[1:33:29-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:29):**  So yeah, right about that 26 months.  We were putting 1,300 pounders on the rail.  Okay.  
**[1:33:36-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:36):**  Anyway, I do like the butchering heifers.  You take a calf off of them, or I mean, if they don't have a calf on them, you owe  a two to three-year-old animal that doesn't have a calf nursing on her, she gets fat in  
**[1:33:53-1:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:53):**  a hurry.  And…  And probably not much feed.  
**[1:33:57-1:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:33:57):**  Yes.  Or the same set of resources that the cows are on in that timeframe, they can explode.  Yes.  
**[1:34:06-1:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:34:06):**  So that's what works for us.  Anyway, Angus, we have dabbled with a few other things.  But those – Angus with the touch of Hereford is what works well for us because the size  
**[1:34:28-1:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:34:28):**  animal we have works good for the grass finishing.  But it's also something that sells well if we decide we don't want this set of animals,  we want to take this set of calves, these deer calves to the sale barn, they still sell  
**[1:34:41-1:34:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:34:41):**  good.  You don't want to get your throat torn out like I would.  No.  
**[1:34:46-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:34:46):**  We're marketing something that fits what the commodity buyers want.  And that's what works for us.  That's one of the lessons.  
**[1:34:59-1:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:34:59):**  You see a number of people that direct market and they want to raise this type of heritage  breed whatever, blah, blah, blah.  That's fine.  
**[1:35:07-1:35:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:35:07):**  If you can make that work for you and it tastes wonderful, have at it.  But if it doesn't work for you and you have to sell it somewhere else, not everybody wants  that animal.  
**[1:35:21-1:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:35:21):**  So you're either going to be hauling that thing a long ways or you're going to be selling  it at a big discount.  If you have to market what you don't want at a huge discount, you've just wiped out  
**[1:35:33-1:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:35:33):**  the premium you've made direct marketing.  That's a good point.  That's a good way to look at it.  
**[1:35:41-1:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:35:41):**  For us, we try to make sure everything works.  Even though we're adding value, our backstop always has to be to make sure that it works  on a commodity system because that's the floor that's set.  
**[1:35:57-1:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:35:57):**  I agree.  Because those are the tools you have right now basically.  As much as we wish we could change the system, we can still use it to our advantage.  
**[1:36:09-1:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:09):**  We can still participate.  You're still constrained by it really to a degree.  We can want to change the system, but we can't change economics.  
**[1:36:18-1:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:18):**  And we can't change math.  We can not change math.  One of my favorite things to cook on – well, I've got – oh, gosh, we start talking  
**[1:36:27-1:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:27):**  about cooking and cast iron and all that.  We'd be here another three hours.  That's okay.  
**[1:36:33-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:33):**  My brother gave me a Himalayan salt block a few years ago.  I have seen them.  And I use mine on the grill.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:41):**  You have to put it on right when you light the fire so that it heats up slowly with the  fire.  You can't put it on the real hot right away.  
**[1:36:50-1:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:50):**  It has to heat up slowly.  But I'll scrape it off and I'll just cook the meat right on that salt block.  No seasoning.  
**[1:36:58-1:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:36:58):**  Sometimes I'll put just a little bit of olive oil on it.  You want to help sear it.  Okay.  
**[1:37:01-1:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:01):**  Let me get the mental picture.  So you have this big slab of salt.  It looks like a cutting block.  
**[1:37:06-1:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:06):**  It's – I forget.  There's a lot more than just the two of you.  Anyway, it's about basically one square foot is what we'll call it.  
**[1:37:18-1:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:18):**  And it's just a tile.  A tile, right?  Yes.  
**[1:37:21-1:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:21):**  Okay.  It's about three inches thick.  Wow.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:25):**  Probably two and a half inches now because it's – we've shaved some of it off.  And you put the meat right on that salt block and just cook it right on that block.  In the grill.  
**[1:37:37-1:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:37):**  On the grill.  It sears it on that because it gets hot, right?  Yes.  
**[1:37:41-1:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:41):**  Yeah.  And what I'll do is I'll cook most of the time – pork chops are my favorite to do  on it.  
**[1:37:46-1:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:46):**  Okay.  And I'll cook them on there.  And then right at the tail end, you all might pull them off and finish them up right over  
**[1:37:54-1:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:37:54):**  the fire.  You ought to kind of sear them.  And then we'll take them in and chow down.  
**[1:38:00-1:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:00):**  And I've tried – oh, we've got a good friend of the family that goes salmon fishing  in Alaska every year.  And he sends us some Alaskan salmon.  
**[1:38:13-1:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:13):**  And that is exceptional done on the salt block.  So we have to give that a try.  Yeah.  
**[1:38:20-1:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:20):**  We cleaned some of our own bass out of our farm pond and a couple of catfish.  Not so much.  Did they taste like pond water?  
**[1:38:29-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:29):**  They still tasted like pond water.  I think that's probably why I don't like fish because I grew up eating some bass out  of farm pond.  
**[1:38:41-1:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:41):**  No, I know that's why I don't.  My mom told me she hated fish growing up.  I hated fish because my dad fished all the time and he would bring all these fish home  
**[1:38:47-1:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:47):**  and scale them all over the yard and then stink up the house with them.  I never ate fish until I was pregnant.  When I got pregnant with Krista, for some reason I wanted to eat fish.  
**[1:38:55-1:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:38:55):**  And then I started trying like ocean fish and it's totally different.  Yeah.  We're strictly – back to being just strictly sport fishers catching release at our pond.  
**[1:39:05-1:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:05):**  Anyway.  We've been here for like over an hour and 45 minutes.  Can you believe that, Kurt?  
**[1:39:12-1:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:12):**  I wondered how we would fill the time and I think we've hardly scratched the surface  of what we could …  Yeah, I was going to say.  
**[1:39:21-1:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:21):**  What …  We could probably sit here another three hours if you can – I don't think we can.  We spent like two hours riding around kind of talking about what we weren't going to  
**[1:39:27-1:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:27):**  talk about for the podcast and we haven't talked about it yet.  We haven't talked about any of that yet.  So …  
**[1:39:32-1:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:32):**  Well, I was going to say what have you not touched on that's really important to you  that you want to touch on?  What have I not touched on?  
**[1:39:40-1:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:40):**  Well, I told Brian he complimented me that I brought a folder in but I haven't even  opened the thing up and looked in it yet.  That's something I would do.  
**[1:39:48-1:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:48):**  He's the only person that's brought a folder.  Well, it doesn't count if he doesn't use it.  But he brought one.  
**[1:39:57-1:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:39:57):**  Are we just about done then?  We can keep going.  We want to keep going.  
**[1:40:01-1:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:40:01):**  No, like if there's something that – I mean we kind of dove through your story.  Well, I told Brian there is one thing that I wanted to touch on.  We will see how I can do getting through this.  
**[1:40:14-1:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:40:14):**  A number of years ago, I discovered how important mental health is in agriculture.  I shouldn't say I discovered it.  I probably always knew it and just didn't really put two and two together.  
**[1:40:32-1:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:40:32):**  But in – I wrote the years down because I forget.  In 2013, my youngest daughter and I were in a wreck, in a pickup wreck.  I probably should have died but I didn't.  
**[1:40:48-1:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:40:48):**  I semi-hit the broadside of this and I had a severe concussion but I walked home, went  to the – went home from the hospital that night.  About a little over a year after that, Andy and the girls and I sat in our car on a Sunday  
**[1:41:09-1:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:41:09):**  and we watched our house burn to the ground.  That's rough.  There's better ways to spend a Sunday, I can assure you.  
**[1:41:18-1:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:41:18):**  There sure are.  There sure are.  Well, you know, by God, you just – you keep on going.  
**[1:41:26-1:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:41:26):**  You just hitch up your britches and you keep on going.  In retrospect, that was probably a mistake.  You know, you just shove stuff deep down inside and you just keep on going because by God,  
**[1:41:41-1:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:41:41):**  that's what you do.  And oh, a few years ago, I found myself in a really, really dark place.  I think looking back, those two events I think changed something inside of me, as you might  
**[1:42:02-1:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:42:02):**  imagine.  And I found myself in this really, really dark place.  And luckily, this goes back to what I said earlier.  
**[1:42:15-1:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:42:15):**  I married a very good person.  She knew I needed some help.  And I spent some time talking to the good people at the Iroquois Center in Greensburg.  
**[1:42:31-1:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:42:31):**  And I started doing a few things and I realized I suffer from – I fight a little bit of  depression and I – luckily, mine was not – is not severe.  I'm not on any medication.  
**[1:42:48-1:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:42:48):**  Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what one needs.  But I was able to just start – it made me very aware, though, that too often in agriculture,  we don't take time to take care of ourselves mentally.  
**[1:43:03-1:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:43:03):**  This is back to what we were talking about with –  Suck it up.  Going on.  
**[1:43:08-1:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:43:08):**  We don't step back and just – it'll be there tomorrow.  We just – we don't – you'll reach out for help when we need it.  And the thing is, in our country, we are surrounded by people that love to help people.  
**[1:43:25-1:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:43:25):**  That's probably one of our countries.  Rural America's biggest asset is people love – they don't – people don't like  to admit that they need help themselves, but they'll go help other people in a heartbeat.  
**[1:43:37-1:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:43:37):**  And anyway –  That is one of the sad but unfortunate truths is like you'll never – if you ask somebody  for help out here, very, very rarely will you get told no.  
**[1:43:52-1:44:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:43:52):**  And I think it's because we just have that block in our heads against asking for help  that when we hear that request, it's such a novel thing.  It's like, well, yeah, I'll do whatever I can to help you.  
**[1:44:03-1:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:44:03):**  I wish everybody could – after our house burned, that's one of the most humbling  things.  To support complete strangers, people –  
**[1:44:17-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:44:17):**  Changed my life.  Helping you out.  I wish everybody could experience that without having to go through the shitty stuff to get  
**[1:44:27-1:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:44:27):**  to that point.  But that's not how it works.  But anyway, that's – we made a few – when I was in this little – I call it the dark  
**[1:44:42-1:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:44:42):**  spot, dark place.  Anyway, I crawled back up out of it with a lot of help.  And it's amazing when – I call it the my house burned to the ground club.  
**[1:44:58-1:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:44:58):**  There's a lot of people that are in that club that you don't know it.  It's a club nobody wants to be in, but once you're in it, you've got – you're surrounded  by a lot of good people.  
**[1:45:08-1:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:45:08):**  The depression was the same way.  There's a number of people that reached out to – I made something somewhat public  and said that I – you know, kind of – I fight this beast and it is a beast.  
**[1:45:20-1:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:45:20):**  A number of people reached out and said, you know, I fight the same – and there's three,  four, five guys that I talk to somewhat regularly that I know have fought the same beast and  –  
**[1:45:40-1:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:45:40):**  I've struggled with depression on and off my whole life.  I don't know if it's an accountability club, but there's something about –  It's a vulnerability club.  
**[1:45:52-1:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:45:52):**  When you give the power of that anxiety, the stress, the depression and the aloneness away  when you're not alone with it anymore, it doesn't have the same power because you're  not sitting there wondering anymore, is everybody feeling this way?  
**[1:46:08-1:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:08):**  Am I alone feeling this way?  Why am I feeling this way?  Suddenly it's like, oh, wow, it's not just me.  
**[1:46:13-1:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:13):**  Everybody else has felt this.  This is human and this too shall pass.  This is my emotions and I'm stronger than this.  
**[1:46:21-1:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:21):**  And you've got to have people remind you of that.  And I – you know, the doctor, I was – visited with, he said, you need to find something  to do that's just you.  
**[1:46:29-1:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:29):**  That's not work.  Well, it took me a while to get there, but I rediscovered how much I love fishing.  And I've been fishing and then my youngest daughter decided she likes to fish.  
**[1:46:46-1:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:46):**  She's a hell of a fisherman.  My grandpa was a – that's another story I want to tell before we're done.  My grandpa was quite the fisherman too.  
**[1:46:58-1:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:46:58):**  Anyway, I've probably – I probably fished once or twice a year for the 10 or 15 years  prior to this spring.  This year, since spring, if I didn't – once it warmed up, if I didn't fish once or twice  
**[1:47:18-1:47:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:47:18):**  a week, it was – Anne and I were going down to the pond at least once a week or we were  going somewhere.  That's awesome.  
**[1:47:27-1:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:47:27):**  And I was like, as a mom, not your person or anything, but like that's a proud thing  to be able to see – to be able to spend that time with your family.  We'd go down there and, you know, we'd take the ranger down there and we just – everything  
**[1:47:44-1:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:47:44):**  just stopped.  And there was one afternoon we went down there.  Anna says, we've been down here, what, about an hour?  
**[1:47:53-1:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:47:53):**  We've been there for almost five hours.  Oh, wow.  I mean, it just – I mean, the fish were biting.  
**[1:47:59-1:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:47:59):**  It was one of those – You were –  Just having a great time?  Yeah.  
**[1:48:02-1:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:02):**  It's just – it's like, why is it getting dark at like four o'clock?  It's kind of warm and fuzzy for me to hear that.  My dad took me fishing.  
**[1:48:09-1:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:09):**  Actually, my dad took me fishing out at Brian's Ranch years and years before I ever knew Brian  or that Brian existed.  And my dad didn't drink.  
**[1:48:17-1:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:17):**  So a lot of times you hear people fishing and drinking, you know.  But my memories around fishing have always been mom – me and my dad doing stuff together.  And so it's kind of nice to hear you doing fishing things with your girls and not just  
**[1:48:30-1:48:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:30):**  drinking fishing stories, I guess.  My grandpa, I mentioned, he's – he came home from – he was in Europe in World War  I.  
**[1:48:45-1:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:45):**  He came home from Europe.  And this was before he married my grandma.  He went to Canada.  
**[1:48:54-1:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:48:54):**  He spent this winter in Canada trapping with a Norwegian.  Oh, cool.  And I mean, that's – then I think he just had one last –  
**[1:49:06-1:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:06):**  Like a sabbatical winter for himself to go.  He probably just needed to wind down after seeing God knows what over Europe.  Yeah.  
**[1:49:13-1:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:13):**  Well, yeah, I bet so.  And, you know, anyway, then he came back to the farm and, you know, the rest was history.  And then the other deal, 1936, my dad was six years old.  
**[1:49:27-1:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:27):**  And depression, dirty thirties, drought, all that.  Nothing was growing.  They – we didn't have any cattle at the time, but, you know, grandpa had a flock of  
**[1:49:36-1:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:36):**  sheep or herd of sheep, whichever it is, and hired some old guy.  He traded out if he could stay in the house, you know, if he just took care of the sheep.  And grandpa knew how much money he was going to – you know, if he was going to stay on  
**[1:49:51-1:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:51):**  the farm and try to farm.  The banker said, well, I'll loan you X amount of money.  My grandpa borrowed the money.  
**[1:49:58-1:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:49:58):**  But instead of farming, they bought a new car and they loaded up the family and they  left.  They drove up.  
**[1:50:06-1:50:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:06):**  They spent about 18 months.  I don't know if it was over a year or not.  Anyway, they just took off, they went up, you know, into – I think they – somewhere  
**[1:50:18-1:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:18):**  up through Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and then straight south, they saw the Grand Canyon  and then eventually, you know, back to protection.  Oh, cool.  
**[1:50:28-1:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:28):**  And, you know, back then, they just drove.  And when they wanted to eat, they would just stop and camp and then they'd fish and they'd  catch their food.  
**[1:50:38-1:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:38):**  And, you know, gas didn't cost, you know, hardly anything.  And – Grandpa had a camera and he filmed a lot of that trip.  And a number of years ago –  
**[1:50:52-1:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:52):**  Oh, wow.  This is the same – I sent you a copy of the diary he kept when he was in Europe too,  I think.  
**[1:50:58-1:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:50:58):**  Yeah, that was an amazing read, by the way.  Thank you for sharing.  Anyway, he logged – took all these pictures of that trip.  
**[1:51:05-1:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:05):**  So the diary I just mentioned when my grandpa was in Europe, he kept a diary.  In a few years – I mean, you can hardly read the writing.  A few years ago, I had a cousin that transposed that and put it all – wrote it all out so  
**[1:51:20-1:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:20):**  it's actually readable.  And then, to enhance it even more, he went to Google Maps.  He kind of looked at the towns where he'd been and he kind of pieced together a map  
**[1:51:33-1:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:33):**  that would have been a path where –  Oh, cool.  Oh, and Grandpa was – he was in the band.  
**[1:51:40-1:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:40):**  He – when they first signed – he'd never played the clarinet until he was in the Army.  But they said they were looking for volunteers to be in the band.  And he told Dad in later years that he thought that was the safest way to go over.  
**[1:51:54-1:51:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:54):**  He knew he was going to go over there, but he thought he had the least chance of getting  shot.  Smart guy.  
**[1:51:59-1:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:51:59):**  Anyway –  Give me the choice, Tink.  Yeah, I'd probably try to join the band too or the chorus or –  
**[1:52:06-1:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:06):**  He learned how to play the clarinet.  So –  That's interesting.  
**[1:52:10-1:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:10):**  So is the diary printed as a book now or –  It's – he – it's on a – you know, it's not really a book, but it's printed  out.  
**[1:52:22-1:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:22):**  Each of us kids – the cousins all have it.  And then I'd be happy to send you a copy of it if you wanted to read it online.  That'd be really interesting.  
**[1:52:30-1:52:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:30):**  My dad would get a huge kick out of that too, for sure.  It's fascinating.  Yeah, I bet so.  
**[1:52:35-1:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:35):**  That's awesome.  That's quite a rabbit trail we went down there.  But I guess it's a piece of the puzzle of who I am today, I guess.  
**[1:52:42-1:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:42):**  Hate.  It's all pieces of the puzzle.  Anyway –  
**[1:52:46-1:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:52:46):**  I appreciate you being as open and as vulnerable as you have been because I know that's not  easy to share, but every person that is able to share a little bit of a story like that,  you know that somebody sharing their story helped you.  
**[1:53:02-1:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:02):**  And I know you know that and it's just – it compounds.  So every time you're able to do that –  Well, if I could help somebody with that story, if I could choose somebody to help somebody  
**[1:53:12-1:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:12):**  with that story or help somebody with their grazing, I can assure you which story is –  More important.  More important.  
**[1:53:22-1:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:22):**  Yeah.  Is there anything after going through that experience and still dealing with that beast  because it doesn't just go away that you would want to share that you feel like would  
**[1:53:31-1:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:31):**  have been helpful for you to know five or six years ago that – I mean in small communities  we don't talk about this.  So how do we get people more willing to share?  
**[1:53:42-1:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:42):**  Just know that there's more people out there that fight this beast than what you do, what  you think.  And honestly, everybody's got a story.  
**[1:53:55-1:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:53:55):**  An old guy that I've always had a tremendous amount of respect for told me one time, he  said, you know, so you think you got it bad, just look around and then figure out who you  want to trade places with.  
**[1:54:13-1:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:13):**  Chances are it will be nobody.  So then you just get your chin up, put your best foot forward and keep on going.  So –  
**[1:54:21-1:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:21):**  That's good advice.  Yep.  Very good advice.  
**[1:54:24-1:54:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:24):**  Probably great advice.  We've gone past two hours.  You want to keep going or you're ready to end and go down to Legends and get a burger?  
**[1:54:32-1:54:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:32):**  I'm ready to go get a burger.  Well, we're going to go down to Legends and eat some of their wonderful food here  in Pratt.  
**[1:54:39-1:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:39):**  My friend Cody Easton's is the owner of that place.  Same guy that lets me use this awesome studio to record this wonderful episode in.  So Kurt, have we forgotten anything you need to talk about?  
**[1:54:50-1:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:50):**  You know, I should probably mention if you're in need of meat.  Yeah.  You should probably mention your website.  
**[1:54:57-1:55:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:54:57):**  Yes.  Dalefamilyfarms.com.  Okay.  
**[1:55:00-1:55:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:00):**  What can we get at dalefamilyfarms.com?  We offer grass-finished beef, variety – almost any cut of the animal.  We have pork and we also have poultry chicken.  
**[1:55:15-1:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:15):**  You can get whole chicken or you can get chicken parts, either one.  And it's all fabulous and our freezer is full of it.  I can vouch for that.  
**[1:55:23-1:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:23):**  We can sell individual cuts.  Our freezer is not full of their ground beef.  I talked to Andy yesterday.  
**[1:55:29-1:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:29):**  Okay.  Right.  But you guys deliver too, don't you?  
**[1:55:32-1:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:32):**  Yes, we do.  Do you ship?  No.  
**[1:55:35-1:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:35):**  We have dabbled with shipping.  Right now, the logistics for us aren't that good.  Okay.  
**[1:55:38-1:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:38):**  But you guys are a pretty big delivery circle.  Yeah.  Well, if you – circle isn't the shape that I would describe.  
**[1:55:41-1:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:55:41):**  But we go to the southwest part of the country.  We go with liberal up to Garden City and back, stops in between with some variation from  time to time.  
**[1:56:09-1:56:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:09):**  And we do that once a month.  And we also – we call it a delivery trip to the east.  There's – you know, Larno, Great Bend, Hutchison area down to Wichita and then back  
**[1:56:20-1:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:20):**  to Protection.  And then once a quarter, we will go all the way to the Kansas City area.  That works because I've got family up there.  
**[1:56:32-1:56:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:32):**  That one's a two-day trip.  We'll go and we'll hit spots in between here and there.  And then people meet at my brother's driveway.  
**[1:56:41-1:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:41):**  And he always thinks that's cool that customers show up and he gets to visit with them.  Gets to meet people.  Yeah.  
**[1:56:47-1:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:47):**  They show up at the little complex there where they live.  And then I head back and we make other stops on the way home.  So.  
**[1:56:56-1:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:56:56):**  Very cool.  The delivery does – it works for – anyway, the delivery trips work for us.  We decided that the – if we move enough product, the cost of owning a van and the  
**[1:57:16-1:57:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:57:16):**  fuel is less than every now and then having to have stuff on sale at a big discount.  And it ties in – it keeps the product moving theoretically.  I can see that.  
**[1:57:33-1:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:57:33):**  So we don't like to run sales because –  I don't think I've ever seen you run a sale or offer a discount.  People often – and we're guilty of this too.  
**[1:57:50-1:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:57:50):**  You see something on sale, well, I'll just wait for it to go on sale.  Yep.  Well.  
**[1:57:55-1:58:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:57:55):**  You know something that – I heard a really good piece of advice during this whole COVID  thing.  It came from a small business owner and somebody who goes around and really makes it a point  
**[1:58:06-1:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:06):**  to spend their money in small businesses.  A lot of local small businesses try really hard to offer those discounts, especially  to their long-time customers.  
**[1:58:15-1:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:15):**  And this opened my eyes.  I want to use the discount at Walmart.  I want to use the discount at Dillon's.  
**[1:58:20-1:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:20):**  I don't want to use the discount at Ace Hardware.  I don't want to use the discount at your store.  I want to spend my money at your store and not spend the damn money at Walmart.  
**[1:58:29-1:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:29):**  So I've made it a point to say thanks for the discount card, but you can keep that.  I'll spend my money here.  And it's Brian's itching to talk.  
**[1:58:39-1:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:39):**  Well, I think Mike Calacrate almost said that verbatim.  Like whatever that was, 34, 35, 30, whatever episode he just did at Calacrate.  I know how much your product costs and I budget for it.  
**[1:58:49-1:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:49):**  That's all there is to it.  Well, we appreciate you for that.  That's just how you look at it.  
**[1:58:56-1:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:58:56):**  Mike says that he wants to pay full price because he wants to know that the people that  work there are getting paid fair wage for the labor that they're doing and not that  that company that's offering the discount card is not externalizing their cost.  
**[1:59:11-1:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:11):**  Like Dollar General does.  We've spent enough time yelling about Dollar General on this show.  Mike Calacrate spent enough time yelling about Dollar General for all of us.  
**[1:59:22-1:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:22):**  Yeah.  I won't go down that road either.  We're not trying to sell to everybody.  
**[1:59:29-1:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:29):**  Yeah.  And you know what?  No matter how cheap you, if that was your target, if we said, you know what?  
**[1:59:37-1:59:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:37):**  We're selling everything for a dollar.  There'll be somebody trying to talk you down 50 cents.  That is an amazing, amazing, amazing piece of advice for any business owner is that you  
**[1:59:46-1:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:46):**  are not.  You're not going to be right for everybody.  And if you try to please every customer, you're not going to please any of them.  
**[1:59:50-2:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=1:59:50):**  And so we, what we try to offer is service and relationship.  You know, a number of people, you know, our customers, we have some that have been with  us close to 15 years.  
**[2:00:09-2:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:09):**  We know their story and we've had some, we've delivered their house.  You give them a little extra special.  And you know what?  
**[2:00:19-2:00:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:19):**  The, the, the Piggly Wiggly or Dylan's or whatever is not going to go in and help you  fill your freezer.  You know, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[2:00:26-2:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:26):**  Or find that like, I mean, Andy has come through town before and hollered at me to drop stuff  off at my store because somebody in medicine lodge needed to pick something up and wasn't  around and you guys will go out of your way to find that person in that place to make  
**[2:00:36-2:00:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:36):**  sure people can get their food if we need to.  Yeah, it's a huge deal.  Now that being said, uh, when we do deliveries and we're on set schedule, don't make them  
**[2:00:45-2:00:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:45):**  wait.  Don't appreciate if you're on time.  Yes, yes.  
**[2:00:51-2:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:51):**  It's been, I've not been here.  Hey, thanks for letting me do this today, guys.  Kurt, this is the first time I've really been on a podcast.  
**[2:00:58-2:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:00:58):**  Well, you know what?  Me too.  Well, it's not, it's not produced in your basement though.  
**[2:01:04-2:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:04):**  No, no.  Brian's not going to say, okay, okay.  Now that that was a good practice.  
**[2:01:09-2:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:09):**  This one's for real.  Yeah.  Are you guys really ready to do it now?  
**[2:01:12-2:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:12):**  We've just been warming up for two hours.  I'm about ready to actually hit the record button.  Ready set go.  
**[2:01:17-2:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:17):**  No, seriously.  It's been great.  Tonya, thank you for, uh, thanks for being here.  
**[2:01:22-2:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:22):**  Really appreciate you joining us for this episode and, uh, you might have to do this  again sometime.  I'm glad I got to be here and visit with you too.  
**[2:01:30-2:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:30):**  Always appreciate your insight.  Same with you, Brian.  Thanks for having me.  
**[2:01:33-2:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:33):**  Once again, I'm thankful.  I'm humbled that you would think what I had to offer is worthwhile.  So I appreciate that.  
**[2:01:41-2:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:41):**  Kurt, I've always thought that what you've had to offer is worthwhile ever since I first  met you.  Oh, well, you're very kind.  
**[2:01:49-2:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:49):**  Thanks for being here.  It's been, it's been a wonderful episode.  It's been a great day.  
**[2:01:52-2:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/48-Kurt-Dale-We-all-struggle-e1d671f#t=2:01:52):**  Uh, it was a great day to spend with you and, uh, really appreciate you.  Appreciate you as a neighbor.  And with that, we're going to go ahead and sign off and we'll see you all next week.

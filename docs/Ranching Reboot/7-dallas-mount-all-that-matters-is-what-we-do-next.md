That show last week sure is going to be hard to top.  Temple Grand is going to be a hard guest to follow.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:03):**  But today's guest brings with him over 20 years of experience with State Extension.  We dive into how too much diversity in a business doesn't always lead to profit.  And where you can learn the skills to help you become a better manager and business person.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:17):**  And I want to apologize in advance for the little bit of background noise, the pin clicking.  That wasn't me.  Hiding with me as usual is my co-pilot CK and here she is to introduce today's guest,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:27):**  someone that knows how to walk the walk of good management and a good business.  Hi everyone.  This is Ranching Reboot with Red Hills Rancher and yours truly CK.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:36):**  Today we have Dallas Mount of Ranch Management Consultants.  Dallas, how are you doing?  Doing great CK.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:41):**  How are you?  I'm good.  The snow is melting.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:44):**  So I'm glad we have some wet weather outside.  We're doing good.  How about you, Brian?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:51):**  My mud was starting to get a little bit dehydrated.  So I'm glad that that's back to tacky and muddy and then slowly.  So Dallas.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:01:58):**  Yes, sir.  Just give us a brief overview.  Tell us about yourself and your history and how you got to be where you are.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:05):**  Okay, sure.  I did not grow up in agriculture.  My dad was a Methodist pastor and we traveled around a lot, lived in different places.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:14):**  When I was a junior in high school, we moved to Park City, Utah, and I didn't really seem  to fit in with the kids that were in Park City.  And so I trotted down the valley to a little town of Heber.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:25):**  At that time, it's not anymore.  And that's kind of where I found my peer group.  And most of them were involved in agriculture some way.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:33):**  So that kind of drew me to it.  We did high school rodeo for a while, messed around there, worked on some different places  those years of my life.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:41):**  And when it came time to pick a major for college, animal science sounded like fun.  What the heck?  So off I went to Colorado State University.  
**[0:02:49-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:02:49):**  And at that time, I had the luck and fortune to go to work for some ranching.  Weaver Ranch there north of Fort Collins is where I spent quite a few years in my early  time.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:03:01):**  Did some time on some yearling and hang outfits, and actually spent a year riding pins in a  feedlot.  And did all that through my master's degree.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:03:12):**  And then started as an extension agent here in Wyoming in about 2000.  So did that for about 20 years.  And it was probably about, I don't know, seven, eight years ago, I decided to go to ranching  
**[0:03:26-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:03:26):**  for profit and met Dave Pratt and saw him teach the school and it blew my mind.  I loved it.  So I definitely wanted to be involved with that.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:03:36):**  And a couple years later, Dave came to me and asked if I wanted to learn how to teach  the school and I did and got to teach under his tutelage for several years and then ended  up buying the company here about a year and a half ago.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:03:50):**  So that's my short story.  Well, that's great.  So tell us a little bit more about how you came to, how your relationship with Dave developed  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:04:01):**  and how you came to own the company and talk a little bit about the High Plains Ranch  practice.  Sure.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:04:06):**  Yeah.  So I was in Wyoming and was there for a few years and Aaron Berger and I kind of partnered  up on some things and we decided we wanted to build a program, an educational program  
**[0:04:20-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:04:20):**  for ranchers that was looking deeper than just the things you normally get with extension.  You know, you go to the one-off days of, hey, here's your nutrition talk or here's your  talking on rangeland stuff.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:04:31):**  And nobody was connecting the dots.  So we wanted to pull it together and do an integrated systems type of a course for ranchers.  And Aaron was a big part of this and we came up with the High Plains Ranch practicum, which  
**[0:04:45-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:04:45):**  was an eight-day course that was spread out over six month time period.  People came for two days at a time and we didn't realize at the time, but we were trying  to build ranching for profit from the ground up.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:05:00):**  So we did that with our first few years, we're working with Harlan Hughes from North Dakota.  He was famous for the unit cost of production stuff with the economics and we bring in experts,  right?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:05:13):**  And that became the traveling PowerPoint road show and Aaron and I didn't really like that.  So we kind of regrouped and made it more hands-on, you know, fewer experts, but better quality  teaching.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:05:28):**  And so we did that together for, I don't know, 10, 11 years, probably did about 15 schools  throughout that time and really enjoyed it.  But when I went to ranching for profit, it felt like those guys had created 20 years  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:05:42):**  ago what I was trying to build from the ground up and it, and they'd done a better job of  it to be honest.  So it kind of shifted my focus from what we were doing.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:05:53):**  And I just really fell in love with the ranching for profit curriculum and the change it was  helping ranchers make in their lives.  Awesome.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:01):**  Awesome.  So tell us a little bit about your operation.  You do have some of your own cows, right?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah, I don't own any cattle at the moment.  So my wife and I ended up buying some land that surrounds our house here in Wheatland.  We were lucky enough that the owners of it, you know, we have a little place in the country  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:19):**  and we said to the owners, hey, if you ever want to sell this, let us have a crack at  it.  And they did.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:24):**  And so we ended up buying 80, eight zero, 80 acres of land that surrounds our house,  but it's in a floodplain and it's nice, big, subby, irrigated grass, you know, that grows  six, seven feet tall and not in good years.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:39):**  And so with that, I was able to really kind of put into practice a lot of the intensive  grazing stuff and the more intensive management.  And you know, it started learning some lessons on that, you know, nobody gets it right the  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:06:51):**  first time.  So we took what used to be, used to run 20, 30 cows to running about 80 to 100 cows most  of the summer on that 80 acres.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:07:01):**  And there have been a few years where I owned stuff, I'd buy stockers or buy weaned calves  for my neighbors and run a little stocker deal.  A few times we bought cold cows, short term cows at the barn and turned those.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:07:16):**  But I've really kind of gravitated to the custom grazing.  It fits with my life outside of ranching a lot better.  So I could bring those in May, and then they all go home in the end of October.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:07:29):**  And then this last year, we actually ended up picking up about a 4500 acre piece to the  west of Wheatland.  And so we've expanded that quite a bit.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:07:37):**  I'll be hiring an employee to run it for us this summer.  And then I also lease quite a bit of ground around us at home.  So we run about 200, 250 cows in the summertime and keeps me grounded.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:07:54):**  I know it's kind of a full time job.  So like we say in the intro, this is kind of, we want to give information and we want  to talk.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:03):**  So is there anything so far that comes to mind on advice on how to get started?  Well, yeah, I mean, a lot of things.  We have a lot of people that are getting started into ranching, reach out to us at Ranching  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:15):**  for Profit.  And a lot of people come to the school as, hey, I want to do this as a profession.  I want to be a rancher.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:23):**  And I think the biggest thing where people, when they're starting out, their first thoughts  in their mind is they confuse the land business and the livestock business.  Have you guys, I'm kind of joining in here.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:35):**  Have you guys already talked about this on your podcast before?  Nope, nope, go ahead.  Okay, all right.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:41):**  So owning land is a separate business decision from running livestock.  And the question I like to ask them, this is, could you own a million acres of ranch  land and not own a single stinking cow?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah, the answer is yes.  And then could you own, could you run a thousand cows and not own a single acre?  Yeah.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:09:05):**  So they're two different decisions.  So you could be in the livestock business without being in the land business and you  can be in the land business.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:09:14):**  And really it's more accurately called the land investment.  Land is a great place to park money and build wealth over time.  But it's not a great place to cashflow a business from.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:09:27):**  So if you say, hey, I want to go out and I'm going to spend half a million dollars on this  piece of land.  It's the pretty rare piece of land that really cashflows very well.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:09:38):**  So I mean, you could be building wealth during the time you own that land, but you also could  be broke doing it, if that makes sense.  So I think that's the number one thing for people to start with if they're starting from  
**[0:09:49-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:09:49):**  scratch is to realize that being in the land investment is a different business decision  from being in the livestock business.  That's a very important distinction I think a lot of people miss or just simply don't  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:01):**  understand.  And we're talking about the difference between the land business and the livestock business.  And I would even say that on the livestock business, there are two parts.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:12):**  You're either in the livestock business or the meat business.  And the example would be you're either in the cattle business or the beef business.  And for a lot of us producers, there's a point where our animals exit our cattle business  
**[0:10:22-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:22):**  and go to a beef business and whether or not that's our captive beef business in a vertically  integrated model, we're doing direct consumer or some kind of retained ownership model.  At some point, we have to realize that your animals exit the cattle business and enter  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:37):**  the beef business.  And that all has to be separate from the land business.  You're exactly right.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:42):**  Yeah.  And we go through that stuff at the school in pretty good detail about helping people  figure out where to draw those lines in terms of enterprise analysis.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:10:51):**  When does it become its own enterprise?  And I mean, you get some people that just complicate this down so far that they're driving  themselves crazy.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:00):**  Right.  But we need to draw some lines in it somewhere.  And I like what you've laid out there, Brian.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:05):**  We've got a land business, we've got a livestock business, and then really you've got a meat  marketing business.  Right.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:12):**  And I think that a lot of us in the industry, we've totally missed that meat marketing business.  We're just content just to take them to the sale barn and not worry about what happens  after that point.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:21):**  And I think that we have to be a lot more conscious of the product that producing and  connecting where that product.  I agree.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:29):**  It's a real opportunity for some.  I would say there's a lot of ranchers that could become a distraction for.  Right.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:38):**  And if for some people, it's not their skill set.  So it's not right for everybody to think, well, I need to be selling direct to consumers.  Right.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:47):**  Some people just don't have the skills for it, don't want to deal with some of the people  issues related to it, really.  So it's something to be considered, but it's certainly not right for everybody.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:11:59):**  I think it's also kind of important to note that if you're on the outside looking in,  that before you take that jump and make an investment in land or purchase any livestock,  it's important to think about your marketing decision and how you're going to market that  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:12:14):**  product before you even have it.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a good spot to start.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:12:21):**  I see a lot of people that say, well, I want to be a rancher.  And so their assumptions are, A, I need to own the land.  I think we've already debunked that.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:12:29):**  You don't need to own the land.  If you're coming to this with a lot of capital in your pocket, perhaps you do.  You want to.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:12:36):**  But for a lot of people starting up, that's not the case.  And then, you know, B, the assumption is I want to run cows.  Right.  
**[0:12:44-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:12:44):**  And that's a dangerous one as well, because, you know, the cows are great and they're fun.  But I mean, your competition when you're in the cow business is the doctor or the lawyer  or the outside wealthy person that has cows is a hobby.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:00):**  And so you're marketing in the same thing that they're marketing in.  Right.  And they're usually willing to sell that animal at a break even or at a loss where if you're  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:09):**  doing this as a business, you probably don't have that luxury.  So I'm not saying you can't have a ranch that's profitable where you run cows.  I mean, that's not what I'm saying.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:17):**  But I will tell you.  When will you guys do it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:20):**  There are plenty of people doing it.  But it is probably more of the one more of the one of the more challenging lives classes  of livestock to run at a profit is to have that cow herd.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:30):**  So you're dancing around a term and or concept and that is your enterprise to your resource.  You want to talk about that for a minute?  Yeah, and your skill set.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:41):**  So so resource base, I'm sitting on a let's pretend I'm sitting on a beautiful mountain  ranch and and you know, I have wonderful grass six months out of the year.  And then I have snow my armpits for six months out of the year round breeding herd is probably  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:13:56):**  not going to be the most profitable thing for me to run because because the way to get  those animals through those other six months of the year when I've snooped my armpit, it's  going to be shoveling out the feed.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:05):**  Right.  So so there's an example of what we're saying.  So a an environment like that is probably going to suit itself more to a seasonal livestock  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:12):**  enterprise.  You know, and everybody's going to think of stockers.  It doesn't have to be stockers.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:17):**  It could be something that well, I mean, just like what I'm doing a custom grazing somebody  else's cows.  Right.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:22):**  So there's plenty of people that are happy to send you their cows in the spring.  Then maybe they're busy farming.  Maybe they're busy doing something else.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:29):**  And then they come get them in the fall when their farming slows down.  And then they get to have the fun of feeding cows all winter.  So so yeah, so fit your enterprise to your environment.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:40):**  And then I think your skill set is is another thing to consider there.  I mean, what do you what do you want to do?  What do you enjoy doing?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:48):**  What does what you do really add value?  Where do you add value to those animals under your control?  And that's going to be different for all of us.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:14:56):**  Oh, yeah.  So are you starting to see more operations diversify and increase their bottom line?  So I don't think I would, I would say that I am seeing some operations diversifies.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:15:10):**  Sometimes it's good.  And sometimes it's not good.  I'm probably kind of an odd duck in this, you know, you when I was with Extension, you  
**[0:15:20-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:15:20):**  we had like this dog and pony show that Extension was doing for a while about diversity and  sustainability and they were telling everybody, you know, you need to add these other enterprises  and you need to look at ways to diversify your business.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:15:32):**  And if you look at the diversity from an economics perspective, diversity is not a profit maximizing  strategy.  A diversity in itself is a risk management strategy.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:15:47):**  So let's take, for example, a livestock operation that runs cows, runs stockers and runs some  custom-graced cattle.  So they've got three enterprises.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:15:58):**  They've got cows, they've got stockers and they've got custom-gracers.  Now from a risk management, that makes a lot of sense.  I've got cows, I can sell calves.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:16:09):**  If the calf market is not where I want it to be, I can hold those calves back.  They roll into my stocker program real easy.  And I've got custom-graced cattle that I take in.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:16:18):**  And so that's also provide kind of a floor, right?  I know what I'm going to make on those before the year even starts.  It's going to provide good cash flow.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:16:26):**  Now, if we stepped and looked at those three enterprises economically and then said, OK,  well, which one of these enterprises is working the best for every unit of forage on your  ranch, which we call a standard animal unit for every standard animal unit, which produces  
**[0:16:43-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:16:43):**  the highest gross margin, which just makes the best contribution.  And we look at those, well, one of them is going to win.  I mean, one of them is going to be higher than the other.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:16:54):**  And so if you looked at that and you said, well, why don't we just do more of that?  So there's your profit maximizing strategy is you do the thing that has the highest gross  margin to the to the most for all the resource.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:07):**  Right.  Because these are the example I gave.  These three things are competing for resources.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:12):**  Right.  So so that's what I mean when I say diversity is a risk management strategy.  There is a there is a but.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:20):**  So if you can overlay an enterprise that doesn't compete for resources on your ranch and it  doesn't require a bunch of overheads, it doesn't make you add a bunch of people and stuff.  Right now, now we're talking about something that's really going to add to your.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:36):**  So in those kind of examples, I'm a fan of diversity.  But when when you have people that are trying to do lots of little things, to me, that just  creates chaos.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:46):**  And you create a lot of work for yourself and you're working your butt off.  And at the end of the year, you look at your balance sheet and you think, well, what did  I actually do?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:54):**  Right.  So so that's what I too often see in diversity.  Don't let it get away from you.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:17:59):**  I think a term that I've heard thrown around several times is enterprise.  Beware of enterprise creep and making sure that you don't overcommit yourself beyond  your core core of your business, because we have to at some point we can't ignore the  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:18:13):**  core of our business and get layered extraneous enterprise.  Yeah, I think you got it.  I like businesses that do two or three things well.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:18:22):**  And at scale, I kind of that that's my bias.  You know, when you when you see some business that's trying to do 12 different things, they're  probably not doing any of them particularly well.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:18:35):**  And probably very few of them are actually working at scale.  Right.  Well, something.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:18:40):**  Oh, I guess nothing really comes to mind.  I forgot what I was going to say.  So we've been talking about the school a little bit.  
**[0:18:48-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:18:48):**  And you know, the first time I went to Ranching for Profit was in 2006.  I repeated the school with you as my instructor about a year ago.  And you know, the course has changed a lot.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:00):**  And I can even even kind of trace back to the mid 80s, the late 80s, the first time  my dad went in the late 90s, when he went back again.  And I can see a lot of the changes in the curriculum and the not just the curriculum.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:13):**  I mean, the core material is all still there.  Most of it, you know, that Stan developed and Dave honed.  But the question that keeps on my mind is, what would you say to the people in the past  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:24):**  that have had a less than favorable experience at the school?  I didn't know people like that existed.  Actually, can I interrupt?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:33):**  Yeah.  When I went to school in Northern California, and I'd always heard about Ranching for Profit.  And I actually did have some older rangers that I was networking with.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:45):**  And I just, I did remember them saying negative things about it.  And then when I did the course, you know, because I did it with a group of six other  people.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:19:53):**  And we kind of did it just because we wanted to do it for like a team building thing and  to learn what our ranches were learning.  And I kind of went in with the notion like, I'm not really gonna take anything away from  
**[0:20:03-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:03):**  this this week, because of what I heard heard when I was in college, and my mind was blown.  So I mean, one bad apple can't spoil it for the bunch.  And I will say, you know, I was pleasantly surprised that it is, it was amazing.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:19):**  Like my husband's gonna go as soon as he's done with med school.  I appreciate that.  Okay.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:25):**  I was halfway joking with you, Brian.  I yeah, I do hear of, you know, it's more I think people that have heard about it that  that have this bias of, oh, Ranching for Profit.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:40):**  Here's what they teach.  They teach you that everybody should calve in May and they teach you that nobody should  put a pay and they teach you that everybody should do this intensive grazing stuff.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:48):**  Right.  And if that's all somebody gets out of six days, they want to be prescribed money.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:20:56):**  So I mean, sort of back up a little bit.  We don't tell anybody they should calve in May.  We don't tell anybody they should stop making hay.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:05):**  In fact, if you if you look at your numbers, the Ranching for Profit way, you might find  that your hay business is the profit driver of your whole ranch and your cows are just  getting in the way.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:15):**  Right.  So so I don't think we I would like to think that we don't offer prescriptions on on how  you should ranch.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:23):**  You know, of course, we all have our biases.  I have my biases.  Alan, Alan Crockett, one of our instructors, Dave Pratt.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:29):**  I mean, everybody's got their biases on things.  And sometimes those biases come through.  But but at the core of it.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:35):**  So so the principles that and you mentioned this, Brian, when you introduced it, the principles  that Stan developed and that Dave and Dave perfected, those principles are are the same  curriculum that we're teaching today.  
**[0:21:48-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:21:48):**  And to me, that's really incredible that these guys were so far ahead of their time.  I mean, Stan was such a leader in his time and in the 70s and 80s.  And then David took that those principles and built a beautiful curriculum around them  
**[0:22:01-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:01):**  that we all get to get to experience and teach.  And so for me, it's just really an honor to be able to share those.  You know, we have updated the curriculum.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:12):**  And really, that's come from input from people that have been to the school or those people  in the E.L. that are learning, you know, new ways of looking at things and thinking about  things.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:25):**  Wally Olson has had a big impact on us in the last several years with with some of the  ways he thinks about how to how to value animals and how to look at those value relationships.  And we've integrated that into the school in some ways.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:36):**  So yeah, I think the curriculum continues to adapt and I hope it does continue to adapt  during my time because, you know, anything that that doesn't change is going to become  irrelevant over some period of time.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:48):**  Right.  You know, I can say that when I went in 2006, Dave was my instructor.  And as luck would have it during that course was actually Alan Crockett's very first time  
**[0:22:59-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:22:59):**  instructing any part of the Ranching for Profit curriculum on his own.  And it's it's been interesting to see the changes and and see how the courses developed.  And I think a lot of us are really excited to see the energy you're bringing back to  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:23:14):**  the program.  Not that not that it was lacking.  It's just a different perspective.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:23:17):**  Yeah, I can see that.  I mean, I think we all have had strengths, you know, through the different ownership  that it's gone through.

And I and I think Dave's been kind of I think of him as the as the painter of the Mona Lisa.  Right.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:23:38):**  I mean, this this curriculum is is an incredible piece of art in terms of an educational process.  And I think a lot of that goes to Dave.  You know, these the flip charts that we build, a lot of those are straight out of his mind.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:23:52):**  And he he's the best curriculum developer I've ever had the opportunity to work with.  And so what I hope I can bring to it is, you know, maybe just a different perspective.  I'm sure I'll have my own touch to add to it.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:05):**  But I really want to rely on the ranchers that are coming through the program and those  people that are involved in EL to help us continue to shape it.  That's kind of where I'm looking to is to is to how these people are using this to change  
**[0:24:17-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:17):**  their lives and their business.  So what kind of continue down that track and what's maybe veer off a little bit on a mental  health.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:25):**  And that's kind of a big thing now is, you know, we're starting to talk about some of  these mental health issues in ag and be a little bit open, a little bit more open about  it.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:35):**  And my wife and I were actually having this discussion the other night that, you know,  in some ways, when you go to ranching for profit, and you sit that table with the five  other businesses, or even when you decide to continue on into executive link, and you're  
**[0:24:48-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:48):**  sitting there with your executive link board, that's kind of almost a form of group therapy.  And in order to be an effective participant, you have to put your ego in a box and leave  it right outside.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:24:59):**  That's maybe not something those of us in agriculture that skilled at doing is it?  I think we can all work on it.  And you know, we can all work on it, and we can all learn together.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:25:10):**  I'm really glad you brought this up, right?  To me, this is something that that has been too easily ignored among people in agriculture  for too long.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:25:20):**  And it is it's it's an absolute travesty about what's going on in in agriculture.  And I really think about the it's mostly the men in in our business that struggle with  this, you know, and it's that tough macho, everything will be okay, you know, you'll  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:25:39):**  get through it.  We don't talk about this kind of stuff.  Right.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:25:43):**  And I think we're starting to see a change at that.  And we do talk about it at ranching for profit.  And I think people, we don't talk about it till midweek.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:25:53):**  Because I think we need to allow people to become comfortable with with the people that  they're sitting with.  And, and those kind of things before we can talk about these things that really require,  
**[0:26:04-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:04):**  as you said, a level a level of vulnerability to start that conversation.  But I think it's important that, you know, that we allow ourselves to be vulnerable to  people we trust, so we can share some of these things that you know, that we are worried  
**[0:26:17-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:17):**  about.  And sometimes it's just, it's so intangible, like, you know, I'm just worried about the  weather and the grass quality and the cows are going downhill over the, you know, four  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:27):**  months.  And it's sometimes it's very difficult to articulate some of those, especially to an  outsider that doesn't have a perspective into your business.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:34):**  Right.  Yeah, that's absolutely right.  And, you know, when I mostly think of these people that are managing multi generational  
**[0:26:41-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:41):**  places, I mean, you're kind of an example that Brian, you're, you're the you're following  a generation before you who, who I believe, followed a generation before him if I'm not.  And, and when things get tough, and that if that's the situation you're in, so many times,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:26:58):**  it's easy to look and say, it's my fault.  And it's the decisions that I made, that are putting all this at risk that has come before  me.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:27:06):**  And then we start to turn inward, and we start to put that so that those things on top of  ourselves, and, and it just, you know, at some point, it can become too much.  And, and I think what when we can start having those conversations about it, and, and really  
**[0:27:21-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:27:21):**  look inside the business, you can say, Well, you know, you made reasonable decisions at  that time, with the things you had in front of you.  And, you know, stuff happens, droughts happen, markets, swings happen.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:27:33):**  And the best thing you can do as a manager is just learn from that stuff and move on.  And, and I remember being in a, in an executive link meeting with Wally Olson, and there was  a young man in there.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:27:44):**  And this young man was was putting all this stuff on him, he just had a he bought some  stockers that spring, and the market had turned back and he was probably looking at a 200  or $300,000 loss on these cattle.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:27:56):**  And he was just kicking himself over this thing.  And while he said to him, young man, the only thing that matters is what you do next.  And I thought that is exactly what that young man needed to hear.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:10):**  Because you know, we, we can weigh on this stuff, and we can look back and second guess  it, but really, the only thing that matters is what we do next.  And you know, today, you've got this information, you've got these cattle on hand, you've got  
**[0:28:22-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:22):**  this much grass in front of you, what are you going to do?  Let's make a decision and move forward.  And and you could just see kind of the weight come off of him and and the ability to start,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:33):**  okay, this, this is what we've, we've got to deal with.  And so, I mean, you know, it is kind of a form of group therapy when you when you look  at it that way, because that's the result it has.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:43):**  But yeah, good.  Thanks.  Thanks for that.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:47):**  So I want to back up a little bit.  You mentioned that you have about 80 acres there at your home place in wheatland, or  you never really did say we're obviously wheatland, Wyoming, we get that.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:28:56):**  So you said you you're running about 20 or 30 head and you've pushed that close to 100.  Let's talk about that for a little bit.  How did you get that done?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:04):**  Just better grazing.  End of story, right?  So easy.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:09):**  Yeah.  Yeah, so I'm lucky enough to have some severe dated ground productive areas that are that  are going to respond that way, right?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:21):**  What we did when we got a hold of it, it, you know, the people before us were great  people, but they just didn't have the tools, and I say tools, the information and skills  to manage grass.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:32):**  And so they they put animals in there in spring, and they'd leave them there till fall, and  they'd come pick them up.  So we had places that that were heavily grazed and lots of bare ground and lots of annual  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:43):**  weeds.  And then when you got further away from water, you got to some parts of it that had hadn't  seen a grazing animal for probably three or four years.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:29:51):**  So the first thing we did was was we rested all during the growing season for about two  years, we had a lot of bare ground in the areas close to water.  And looking back on it, I don't know if we needed to rest it that long.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:05):**  But that was the decision.  So we didn't take any cattle during the growing season.  And then in the wintertime, I took in cattle from somebody near me that we just walked  
**[0:30:12-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:12):**  down the road and we grazed it pretty hard all winter long and tried to get most of that  plant material back onto the ground or in the belly of a beast into manure, get that  nutrient cycle happening.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:24):**  So after about two years of doing that, then then we put in a nice fencing and water system,  actually used an NRCS equip project to help us do that, you know, spread the water out  through it and allowed, we put in kind of a backbone system is how I would describe  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:41):**  it.  So it's a high tensile fence that runs down through the a couple of lanes down through  the middle of it.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:46):**  And it creates easy subdivisions that we can then split with high tensile wire, or sorry,  with poly wire.  When I when we first designed that I thought we would just divide it into permanent pastures  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:30:57):**  and graze it through that way.  But then I learned from Jim Garish and some other people about the using poly wire to  create the movable temporary path.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:05):**  And so we started doing that.  Pretty soon I was doing one day sets where we'd graze it one day, move on to the next  and rest it until it was fully recovered.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:15):**  Usually in our area, that's a minimum of 45 days, sometimes as long as in the growing.  So then we started bringing in cattle and grazing that way.  And in probably a year, we doubled the capacity with that we were grazing on that within a  
**[0:31:30-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:30):**  couple years, we doubled it again.  And now I'd say we probably are.  So it's, it's incredible how when you get that soil gets a biology and get those plants  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:40):**  rooted, rooted well.  You know, we still make mistakes on it.  There's years when I graze it too hard.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:46):**  There's years when are not intensive enough with our management.  We have under grazing and overgrazing side by side.  And all my neighbors think I'm nuts, but I had a lot of fun doing it.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:31:56):**  So, so you're in Wheatland, tell us a little bit about the environment there in Wheatland,  what kind of what kind of forage you grow what production is?  Sure.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:32:04):**  So so we live in Wyoming, if you look at us on a satellite map, we're a green spot in  a brown area.  And a wheatland is the largest privately owned irrigation district in the country.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:32:14):**  So there was some developers that came over and put this system in canals and ditches,  you know, used to floodwater across all all this area that we call the wheatland flat.  So our our place sits if you're driving on I-25 through wheatland, we're about a mile  
**[0:32:29-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:32:29):**  to the west of I-25, right when you go through it.  So we're in some of the more productive ground, better soils and wheat.  Our precip is only about 13 inches a year.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:32:39):**  But on the place that we're at most of that on the subby place, most of that is groundwater  coming in.  So you know, if we take a backhoe out and dig down four or five feet, if you come back  
**[0:32:49-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:32:49):**  in the morning, it's going to have a foot of water in the bottom of it.  So it's pretty swampy stuff.  Our forage base on this place is mostly tall wheatgrass, which is a low quality, fast growing  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:03):**  plant.  It's very similar to intermediate wheat, but it outgrows intermediate wheat.  It'll get you know, six, seven foot tall in some areas.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:10):**  So but it can get really coarse and it's got a really high silica content in it.  So managing quality on that grass becomes really important.  If you keep it, you know, between middle middle of your calf high, that's about as far down  
**[0:33:25-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:25):**  as we want to graze it.  And then if you get animals in there when it's just above your knees, that's the way  you want to keep that feed.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:34):**  So kind of managing in that area.  And then we've got some swamp ground that's got, you know, garrison, some fescues, bromes,  some of those kinds of things that's a more diverse mix in our swamp.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:47):**  And then up on our the place we're leasing down on the mountain, it's a it's a 7500 foot,  you know, it's probably still 13 inch precip zone.  It's big country.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:33:59):**  So a lot really rough, a lot of rocky stuff.  And so we're starting into developing some some fencing and water for that for the coming  years.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:34:09):**  But that's gonna that's gonna be a totally different kind of grazing program than what  we do on our on our wet meadows.  So that grass that tall wheat grass, is that a native grass or is that an introduced?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:34:19):**  I'm pretty sure it's an introduced species, I think.  So this ground would have been all farmed at one time.  And I'm pretty sure somebody came back in there and planted that.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:34:27):**  What would native grass there?  So when you go out on the rangeland here, we're a lot of needle and thread, western  wheatgrass mixed in with some, you know, some of our warm season grasses are generally going  
**[0:34:39-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:34:39):**  to be the low growing species, blue grama, buffalo grass, you get into some better managed  stuff, and you'll find some taller warm season grasses, prairie sand reed, big bluestem.  But I'd say 70% of our forage base here is going to be cool season grasses.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:34:54):**  Well, good.  So I heard you say earlier, you grazed pretty hard in the dormant season, you let it rest  the the entire growing season and grazed hard in the dormant season to get that litter cover  
**[0:35:03-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:35:03):**  down.  So the question I keep getting, and I already know the I already know my answer is, do you  hurt the grass plant by a hard graze when it's dormant?  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:35:14):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  So so if we were being correct in our terminology, we would say severe grazing in the wintertime,  right?  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:35:22):**  So so we're taking a lot of that plant material and either hoofing it off or chewing it off.  From a plant perspective, plants are generally not harmed very much by by grazing in the  true dormant season.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:35:37):**  So and, and we say true dormant because if you actually get out there and look, even  sometimes into November, December and into March, there are some there's some active  growth happening, right?  
**[0:35:49-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:35:49):**  So we got to be careful about about that kind of growth.  But but you know, frozen ground, frozen plants that are truly dormant.  You know, most of them don't feel that grazing very much in the in the dormits.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:03):**  And so there's a few exceptions to that in terms of some species.  But I think from a grazing management point, we can severely graze plants more easily in  in the dormant season than we can during the growing season.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:17):**  The thing that generally determines when you need to how severe you can graze is animal  conditions.  So you're usually limited more by what you can ask your animals to in terms of having  
**[0:36:26-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:26):**  a class of animal that you're willing to push a little bit more.  That's generally going to be the more limiting thing.  Now, now there's exceptions to everything softer ground ground that's more prone to  
**[0:36:36-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:36):**  blow, you're going to want to leave more cover on.  But but in this kind of ground that I'm managing, it generally has almost a layer of ice on  at the time.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:45):**  And so we can we can grab her down pretty good animal conditions going to be the determining  factor.  Right.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:36:51):**  What are your thoughts?  Well, um, no, I agree with that.  I think it's really hard to hurt a plant, especially a native hardy perennial grass  
**[0:37:00-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:00):**  species or any other native pasture plant.  I think it's really hard to hurt those with the dormancy.  And like you said, you know, this time of year, I'm getting a considerable amount of  
**[0:37:09-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:09):**  cool season grass growth.  Anytime the daytime temperature gets up in the 50s, I get a nice flush and grass soil  temperature stays, you know, stays fairly warm through the year.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:19):**  So we do get some of that, you know, do get some screen flashes through the year and that  really helps out the cattle.  So you're in a bottom ground, you're on a floodplain and not quite natural forage.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:30):**  So a topic that always comes up when you talk about high density grazing is pugging and  compaction.  So in my experience in my soil types, which trend more towards a sandy or loamy soil,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:42):**  that's I believe that that's less of an issue than a more clay types.  How do you feel about that?  I would agree.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:49):**  I think you've nailed it right on.  Pugging it.  I've never pugged ground.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:37:56):**  Right, whatever.  You've all done it right.  So sometimes you go back and you look at something and maybe you had them there in a heavy rain,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:04):**  or maybe, maybe you left them there too long, and something just happened, right?  You come back and you look at that, and it looks like somebody just tore it up.  And you kind of go, oh, shoot, and then you move on.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:15):**  And in usually following long rest, that ground looks healthier than before it was pugged,  is what I find.  Now, the downside of that is it generally needs more rest after you pug it, then if  
**[0:38:28-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:28):**  you hadn't.  So, so like for me, when I'm on like my faster grazing, I'm coming back within 45 days.  If I happen to pug something up, I'll probably skip it in that next round.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:39):**  And it'll probably have, you know, 100 days, 120 days before it gets grazed again.  And then when you come back and look at it, you can almost see where the line is to where  it was pugged and where it wasn't pugged and where you pugged it, there's generally more  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:53):**  diversity.  Those plants look like they're, I don't know, they just got a jumpstart.  And it's pretty cool.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:38:59):**  Is that what you found?  Yeah, that's very similar to what I saw.  I had a place where I had a lane, we were doing some high density strip grazing, and  
**[0:39:09-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:09):**  we had a lane that was back to water.  And this is back towards the end of May.  We had several good rain showers, good rain events, and the cattle really tracked up that  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:20):**  lane.  And I was pretty depressed about it there at the beginning of June.  And I didn't think it would recover very well.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:27):**  But you know, we're looking at a lane that's 14 feet wide and a couple hundred yards long  on a ranch that's 7,000 acres.  I mean, this is in a pasture that's 100 acres.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:36):**  So what do we got here?  Like not even a percent.  So barely a hair on a gnat's beehive.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:41):**  Am I really going to worry about it?  No.  Is it pugging?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:45):**  Is it compaction?  Does it look ugly?  Absolutely, yes.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:48):**  I followed the advice of one of the hired hands my dad used to have, and just said,  well, I don't like the way it looks.  I'm just not going to go look at it for a while and not dwell on it.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:39:57):**  And then I came back about five months later toward the end of the growing season, toward  the end of the summer.  And that lane where previously had been really short grass and oh, there was some buffalo  
**[0:40:08-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:08):**  grass, some grama grass, but mostly it was like old world bluestem types, Caucasian and  yellow.  And the amazing thing is, is that area that was so bugged up and just torn up with the  
**[0:40:19-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:19):**  cattle when it was wet.  Now that area is six to seven foot tall, big bluestem grass.  And just like you said, you can see the line.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:27):**  You know, there's still a line on the one side where the backbone fence is, but where  we had the lane fence or where we had the strip fences and still see those lines.  And I think so.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:37):**  I mean, you're going to make mistakes in this grazing stuff.  But nature is resilient.  And sometimes those mistakes end up being beneficial.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:44):**  And, you know, and there's something to be said about, you know, having flexibility in  your operation to be able to try some of these and be able to fail small and it not take  you under.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:40:56):**  So I think it's kind of important to talk about that, you know, yeah, the whole ranch  is seven thousand acres.  And when I started getting into strip grazing and doing, you know, a lot more intensive  
**[0:41:05-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:41:05):**  management and high frequency moves, my stockmanship skills improve rapidly.  My forage, my forage evaluation skills improved very rapidly.  My physical health improved pretty much improved a lot, too.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:41:18):**  But what I'm getting at is I just had a pasture that was like two hundred and fifty and that  makes it about three percent of the ranch.  And the power of the strip grazing and the intensive management is we figured out that  
**[0:41:30-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:41:30):**  three and a half percent of the ranch brought in like almost eight percent of them.  So when you look at it that way, you know, that's just from the grazing efficiency.  And that's not, you know, really getting too deep into it and stacking the biology and  
**[0:41:45-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:41:45):**  stacking the production and driving that system higher.  So I'm really excited as you know, for this year, which will be year two of strip grazing  or be the third year of strip grazing.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:41:54):**  I'm really excited to see some of the new some of the changes and some of the new new  plant colonies coming in.  Switchgrass has been fairly rare on the ranch in the last several years since the fires  
**[0:42:06-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:06):**  strip grazing.  I've been trying to grow a bunch of switchgrass and I'm not sure if that's more due to environmental  factors or if that's due to my grazing management, but I'm trying to eliminate those variables  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:17):**  things out.  Let me take this conversation because we're kind of sitting here grass nerding out on  some of the stuff, right?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  We maybe ought to turn it back down to some basics.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:28):**  But I want to connect the dots here because we started the conversation with starting  ranching and how do you start ranching?  And I'd mentioned that a lot of people come into ranching.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:38):**  Hey, I want to be a rancher.  I want to own a ranch and I want to run cows.  Right.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:44):**  And and I think the focus oftentimes is on the animal.  And yeah, you know, and you have people what are you going to enrich?  Oh, because I love animals.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:42:53):**  I love being outside.  Okay, well, you know, but and here we are grass nerding out and talking about grazing  stuff.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:00):**  So I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna put that on me.  And I told you guys, I went to animal science, I got two degrees in animal science, you know,  had a had a masters of nutrition.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:11):**  And I remember when I got out of graduate school, and, and here we are in wheatland,  and I'd actually even done a year towards my PhD.  So I felt like I actually knew something right.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:20):**  And I was placed in the office in wheatland, and they handed you a phone and they give  you a desk and they say, go do something cool.  We'll check back with you in a year is kind of what the instructions are.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:31):**  And so here I'm sitting there and I think, well, I want to I want to help ranchers, right,  I want to go out and help these guys run their ranches better to be more profitable.  And I know all this stuff about nutrition about, you know, genetics and about reproduction.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:45):**  And so the phone would ring and some guy would feel sorry for the new extension agent in  the office and invite him out.  And I jumped out there and, and I we'd say, Okay, let's go see the ranch.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:43:55):**  And so he'd throw me in the pickup and, and we drive out to where the cows are.  And I remember doing this a lot of time, you know, you roll your window down, you drive  through the cows, you look at it, maybe you jump out and walk through these cattle and  
**[0:44:06-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:44:06):**  you talk about their genetics, you look at body condition score, and you look at all  these things that you look at, and then you jump back in the pickup, and you go home and  you go back to the headquarters, you have lunch, you talk for a little while and you  
**[0:44:16-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:44:16):**  go home.  And and I felt like I'd seen the ranch, you know, when I when I'd done this, and it's  the same way as if as if you were going to a farmer was going to invite you out to their  
**[0:44:27-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:44:27):**  farm, and it all they did in the farm is they walked out to the machinery shed, and you  open the doors of the machinery shed, and you looked at the combines, and you went,  Yep, there's the farm.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:44:39):**  And then you close the doors of machinery shed in and you went and had lunch and then  went home and you said, Yeah, I saw the farm.  So I mean, I think for some people listening to this, they're they're getting new into  
**[0:44:49-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:44:49):**  ranching, they might be thinking, Well, why don't these people stop talking about nerdy  stuff like grasses and start talking about cattle and what kind of cattle you run and  what kind of genetic program you have.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:00):**  But I want to bring the conversation back because what what I realized when I started  being around people who were better than I smarter than I knew what drove ranches and  what really made the bottom line is they didn't see the ranch from the livestock, they started  
**[0:45:17-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:17):**  to see the ranch from from the forage resource base and what those forages I mean, if you  really think about ranching, what it is, is we're in the business of capturing sunlight,  tapping into the biology of the soil, and turning that into something that we can harvest  
**[0:45:31-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:31):**  with a grease.  And so often, all we think about is what color that combine is.  And we don't even understand what what crop are growing.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:40):**  So I mean, yeah, we're sitting here grass nerding out.  But I think the reason is, is because we've developed an understanding that that is the  economic engine that runs ranch.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:52):**  And so what we're doing is we're popping the hood up and we're having to look underneath  that thing.  And we're saying how, how is this engine running?  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:45:58):**  How can I help tune it up?  So that it captures more sunlight captures more biology and cycles those things around.  So that's great.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:06):**  You know, that is a good point.  You know, a lot of times people get caught up, I want to ranch, I want black cows, or  I want red cows, or I want Hereford cows, and they don't know three different kinds  
**[0:46:17-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:17):**  of grass that are on their property.  Yeah.  I spoke with Aaron Berger, and he, you know, he's your friend that you worked with for  
**[0:46:25-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:25):**  a long time, Dallas, and he was like, I would be happy if the rangers in my area could at  least identify at least four types of forges that are growing naturally on their ranch.  If they could do that, I'd be happy.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:35):**  And then once we do that, we'll put a price on those forges.  And then then they can actually know the value of the production of what they're for just  giving them.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:43):**  Yeah, yeah, Aaron's Aaron's spot on.  I mean, just, yeah, I don't care if you can name them all and know their scientific names.  But if you can walk out there and say, that's something that I want to see more of, that's  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:46:55):**  something I want to see less of.  And then here's how my management is going to drive that.  I think that's that's the key.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:02):**  I mean, you don't have to completely nerd out on grass, you just have to know a little  bit, know enough to be dangerous.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:12):**  It's true.  I think Burke Tykert said it best.  He said, when I started in this industry, I loved my cattle.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:21):**  And the more I learned, or yeah, the more I learned that I learned to love the land,  and then I learned some more and I learned to love the soil.  Yep, I remember that he, he wrote that article.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:31):**  And part of his thing was there's a new paradigm for ranching soil first, then plants, and  then animals.  And thinking through it in that sequence.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:41):**  And Burke's kind of had the same, you know, real, I mean, he was a he was a livestock  guy from the word go, right?  I mean, that was, he was trained in he was a geneticist, I think is how he was trained.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:47:53):**  And and here he is making those statements.  So we, what a what a pillar of wisdom that guy is.  I hope we can get him on the show someday.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:01):**  I think that but you can't, I bet you can.  He's a very, he's very generous.  So probably just take a quick email.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:08):**  So if you could pick up your operation, I mean, not necessarily the ranching for profit  side of your business structure, but if you could go anywhere in the world ranch, you  could pick up your ranch and go anywhere in the world ranch.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:19):**  Where'd you go?  Why?  Oh, man, what a cool question.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:24):**  I only want to ranch a few months of the world in each of these locations.  Right?  Yeah, what my house cows Florida rotation.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:31):**  Yeah, yeah, I want my cat.  I want my ranch moving.  We've got some a lot of clients down in Texas, and I love to go down into Texas, South Texas  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:41):**  in February.  And, and then as you come up into Central Texas, March and April, and then just kind  of come up into the into those areas.  
**[0:48:49-0:49:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:48:49):**  So you know, I get a look at ranch numbers and in ranch situations all over the US into  Canada, so I'm into Mexico.  I've been to Australia for several months, we had the opportunity to take the family  
**[0:49:02-0:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:49:02):**  over there and stay there for a time period and that was awesome.  And and really, I could ranch in any of the places I've visited and be very happy doing  it.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:49:12):**  They each of those places have unique challenges.  And some people say, well, where's the where's the most profitable place to ranch?  And I think that's not really asking the right question.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:49:24):**  Because if especially when you start looking at the land investment in in overlaying that  right, so you can have very different initial startup costs if that's part of the plan.  But the ranch is in, you know, in the eastern part and over towards the Corn Belt, you know,  
**[0:49:41-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:49:41):**  so I mean, there, it's hard to find contiguous land.  So a lot of those guys, guys are 50 acres here and there.  And putting together a decent grazing program with those kind of challenges is really tough.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:49:54):**  And then you get into, you know, the part of the country where we're in and further  north into Montana and, and there's some real benefits to be in there, you got powerful  grasses and but but, you know, dealing with winters, present some of its challenges, you  
**[0:50:08-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:50:08):**  get into the Great Basin and and you know, there's land costs generally goes down land  acquisition, those things.  But the forage species are not near as, you know, so many more annual grasses in there.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:50:21):**  And then all the government regulations and a lot of that's built around government land,  as your ranching base, and I'm not sure I'd want to want those challenges.  You know, a lot of those guys that have to put up with that it, it's very disempowering  
**[0:50:33-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:50:33):**  from a from a, you know, when you don't, aren't responsible for making those decisions.  So but, but then we've also been on the coast of Northern California.  And I thought that was beautiful.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:50:45):**  Oh, my right.  Wow, could I could that be awesome.  We were just talking about like a growing season and the climate.  
**[0:50:53-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:50:53):**  I think California just offers a great opportunity to raise cattle and just have have forage  for two growing seasons, right for the most part.  And I think it's just it's just so sad that it's really hard to make that work because  
**[0:51:09-0:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:09):**  of regulations and land prices and just everything.  Yeah, I'm gonna get hate mail.  But I'm gonna say it anyway.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:19):**  California is probably one of the most beautiful places on earth that I mean, we have.  Yeah, it's just the problem is it's full of California.  Hey, I'm I understand it.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:33):**  I'm from California.  I think most of us understand what you're saying too.  And I think it just it comes from population density.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:42):**  But but it is it's cool, like where I'm from in the valley.  So I live in the valley, very fertile land.  All irrigated pastures for the most part.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:50):**  And then you have rangeland.  We have these huge giant sequoias that are only two hours away.  Actually it's an hour away.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:51:56):**  And then the coast is two hours away.  So in one day, I can go to the mountains and back into the coast and back and that's unreal.  Where else can you do that really?  
**[0:52:08-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:08):**  And seems like every now I know how long it takes to go see water to go see mountains.  Yeah, well, I'm in I'm in the Flint Hills of Kansas now.  So yeah, different kind of pretty over there.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:21):**  It's pretty.  It's okay.  It's I love my Kansas ranchers.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:24):**  So no knock, no knock on Kansas at all.  It's just a different environment.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:30):**  So, so Dallas, you mentioned you like to travel around a lot.  You visit ranches down in Texas.  How do you get that?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:37):**  How do you travel around so much?  Where do you find time to do that with cattle daily and putting on all these schools?  Oh, you know, I think you're letting me talk about one of my passions.  
**[0:52:50-0:53:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:52:50):**  Which is aviation.  I started flying airplanes, oh, two and a half, three years ago, and I've just completely  sunk all my free time into it.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:01):**  So I love, you know, just today I went out and flew around with a buddy over lunchtime.  And so I enjoy flying airplanes.  And so I've got a lucky enough that I was, I found there was a Bonanza 1952 Bonanza that  
**[0:53:17-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:17):**  was kind of abandoned at our airport here in Wheatland.  And so a buddy of mine helped me and we rebuilt it under the supervision of an aircraft mechanic  here.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:27):**  And so I've got that airplane that I used to do quite a bit of traveling with.  So it makes it a lot more enjoyable.  And sometimes it saves me time.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:34):**  Other times, it costs me time.  So yeah, like when you have a truck.  Is it common?  
**[0:53:41-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:41):**  Yeah.  It's pretty common in like in your area for a lot of people to like fly and stuff on their  own because you're just in such a remote location.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:50):**  Because like my rangers in Nebraska are like, oh, if you get stranded in Denver, just let  me know I will come pick you up in my plane.  I was like, what?  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:53:58):**  What world are we living in?  I'm just wondering.  No.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:03):**  Okay.  It's not like Alaska, you know, you get up into Alaska, and I think everybody flies just  like we drive.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:10):**  It's pretty common.  Okay.  Sounds like I need to travel around with you.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:14):**  Yes.  Let's get stranded in Denver.  What's the latest?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:20):**  What's the latest notch in your belt as a pilot?  Oh, see, I did a tailwheel endorsement.  Just finished that here a month ago.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:29):**  So I, there's a guy at our Wheatland Airport who likes to buy airplanes and he buys kind  of old stuff, you know, that's in various stages of disrepair.  So his latest purchase was a 1947-48, I believe, a Cessna 140, which is one of the original  
**[0:54:47-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:47):**  kind of tail dragging type airplanes.  And so I didn't have, you got to fly an airplane that's a tailwheel.  So it has the two big wheels in front, right?  
**[0:54:56-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:54:56):**  And the back sits down on that little tailwheel.  To fly an airplane that has a tailwheel, you have to have a special endorsement to do that.  And so I started training to learn how to fly that.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:05):**  And that's been so much fun.  That airplane is just a blast to fly.  So we've been flying that one all over.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:11):**  And so I got my tailwheel endorsement here just a month ago.  Cool.  That's really neat.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:16):**  I did get a chance to see Dallas's Bonanza and I'll be someday I'll get up to Wheatland  and you'll take me.  Absolutely.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:23):**  I'd love to.  I'd love to.  So, is there a myth about you or about the school or about the industry in general you'd  
**[0:55:31-0:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:31):**  like to take an opportunity to debunk?  Yeah, I think that the school we've talked about that a little bit and that people hear  that it's prescriptive.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:43):**  And I think that that's one thing that that I'd like to just spend maybe a little more  time emphasizing is and I think a good way to do that is, is the understanding the differences  between principles and practices, right?  
**[0:55:56-0:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:55:56):**  And so a principle is like it's a law.  It's like a rule that works all the time.  And I've heard Alan Crockett describe it as principle is like the law of gravity, right?  
**[0:56:08-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:56:08):**  So the gravity is going to be the same, whether we're here in the States or whether we're  in Australia or whether we're wherever in the world we are, gravity is going to work.  And our school is built upon principles and principles like there are only three ways  
**[0:56:24-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:56:24):**  to increase profit.  Everything is either an overhead, it's either going to be related to decreasing overheads,  improving gross margin per unit or increasing and figuring out which of those three things  
**[0:56:34-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:56:34):**  should be the focus area for your business is going to help you increase profit when  you solve that and address it.  When we talk about grazing principles, we talk about rest for the grass, you know, allow  
**[0:56:46-0:56:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:56:46):**  those plants to fully recover between grazing events.  And now your definition of fully recover that can be debated all day long.  But but I think everyone would agree that after a plant has some kind of harm to it,  
**[0:56:59-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:56:59):**  a stress, whether that's grazing or fire or grasshoppers.  So after that plant has had that harm, that plant is going to be healthier if we allow  it to recover.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:57:08):**  And that principle holds true no matter where in the world you are.  And then we talk about the principle of matching stocking rate to carrying capacity.  So let's make sure that the number of mouths is not exceeding the amount of forage that  
**[0:57:21-0:57:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:57:21):**  we're growing.  And that's a principle that's going to hold true.  So the school is based on on these foundational principles.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:57:30):**  Now the practice is how Brian applies those principles in on his ranch in Kansas is going  to be different from how I'm going to apply those principles to this ranch I'm leasing  at 75, 7800 feet up in the mountains west of Wheaton.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:57:45):**  The application of those principles, the way we the way we apply them is going to look  different.  But the principles work, the principles work no matter where we are.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:57:54):**  And so I think so many people say, well, somebody went to ranching for profit, and they came  home and did this.  So, so that's what they're teaching there.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:01):**  Okay.  And, and somebody might have misheard it, they might look over the fence and say, well,  that person's crazy for doing what they do.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:09):**  But but really, what we do is we put out these foundational principles, which we've been  teaching for almost 40 years now.  I mean, so if they were wrong, we would have been called on the carpet.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:20):**  So I stand firm on these principles.  But the way that people choose to apply them that I mean, that that's where your choices,  your your personal lives, your your value system, how you want your ranch to be all  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:34):**  that stuff has to get overlaid on that.  So I guess that's the biggest myth.  And I hate it when people say we drink the Kool Aid, right?  
**[0:58:41-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:41):**  Because because there's no Kool Aid to drink, there's understandings is what they are.  And I think when we take these things out and look at them, you know, you're gonna see  see those understandings and be question.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:58:53):**  And you know, that's a great perspective that ever sitting here.  You obviously you own the school I've graduated CKs.  We both definitely definitely believe that it's so what do you think?  
**[0:59:04-0:59:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:59:04):**  What do you see the biggest?  What do you see the biggest weak point is in your so I mean, there's things coming to  mind that I wish we could do more could be better in the school.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:59:16):**  Yeah.  But I suppose balance.  I suppose it's a question of balance because you can't really add much without time.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:59:24):**  Yeah, and that's kind of where I was going with that is we've it was several years ago,  Dave and Alan, when Dave still in the company, Dave and Alan and I spent three or four days  up in Mendocino County on the coast of California.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:59:38):**  And we we took the entire ranching for profit school curriculum apart, and we examined each  piece and then we decided what where where we what goes back in and in what order does  it go back in?  
**[0:59:50-1:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=0:59:50):**  And what kind of new things do we need to include?  And, and after going through that, we we had a lot of these discussions, right?  And I mean, there's definitely some things that that we feel fonder about in the curriculum  
**[1:00:01-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:01):**  than other things.  There's, there's some times when we get to a part of the school and I kind of go, this  is my least favorite part to feature, you know, things like that.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:09):**  But when you make other people try.  That's right.  Brian, why don't you get up here and lead this discussion?  
**[1:00:15-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:15):**  So I, you know, what we hear from people is they wish we spent more time on the economics.  And, and that they say, that's why we came to the school is we wanted to, to really,  you know, get get really good at doing these numbers.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:31):**  And, and we move on from the economics about day three of the school.  And that's when we moved to grazing and ecology and integrate nutrition and reproduction and  drought management, although all those things in there.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:43):**  And I can understand that perspective of they wish they wish we've spent more time on those  things.  But but here's the thing is, as I look at that is, we've taught you all the foundational  
**[1:00:53-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:00:53):**  pieces that that you need to know to apply it.  And and it's, you're not going to I've heard Dave say this, and you're not going to learn  to swim by reading a book about swimming.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:01:04):**  You're not going to learn to do economics by just having me stand up there and teach  it to you.  You've got to eventually jump in the pool.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:01:12):**  And the way for, you know, so when people are thinking that my answer to them is, we'll  start doing it, you know, start applying it.  So take these things we've taught you and put your business into it.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:01:21):**  And then when you have roadblocks, you know, we give them the reference manual, we've got  now got RFP online for them to go to, that'll that'll help get them unstuck.  So I guess that if we're going to challenge it, one of the weaknesses is people probably  
**[1:01:36-1:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:01:36):**  don't have a high degree of comfort with with the economics when they leave the school.  But I have found that if people have the self discipline to apply what they've taught, that  they're going to be extremely successful in implementing that because we have given them  
**[1:01:52-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:01:52):**  the pieces of it.  Have you made anybody cry on economics day lately?  I didn't realize people cried.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:00):**  People cry.  That's a thing.  Maybe later.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:06):**  The crying would be in the classroom when they were putting in their own numbers is  when that was going to happen.  So probably not during the teaching of it during the day.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:15):**  Yeah, so yeah, the facilitators at DL, we have a little score sheet, and we get points  every time we make somebody cry.  So  
**[1:02:25-1:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:25):**  no,  I love it.  I don't know how many points I have on that one.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:39):**  We do not.  That's teasing.  Well, that's great.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:44):**  So so what are some things that inspire you inspire you to feel like your best self or  your best?  Wow, this is getting deep, man.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:02:53):**  You know, I really feel I was trading emails with somebody who just went to the school  in Cheyenne yesterday, and they'd given me some nice compliments in that about about  the way the school was run and the teaching and I was I was thanking them for those comments.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:03:05):**  And my response was, I really feel like this is my mission in life is to is to help agricultural  as people that are that are managing the land, to help them be able to save their own businesses.  It's not it's not my job to save your business.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:03:22):**  But but if I can give you give you those skill sets and help maybe just change your thinking,  right, because the real change of ranching for profit happens between your ears.  It's not about it's not about having the do it having the economic model or or knowing  
**[1:03:37-1:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:03:37):**  how to set up a grazing cell that that's not that's not the real change that happens.  It's about the way you see your business and your relationship to your business.  Right.  
**[1:03:49-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:03:49):**  That's that's the change that happens.  So if I can help people change that perspective, change their paradigms, to then come back  at their business with with fresh motivation, you know that that's what keeps me going.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:04:02):**  And you know, when it's really cool when you have people email you, or we get to be a part  of their part of the change through EL and and you really see that man, their their life  is better.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:04:13):**  You know, they're they're living, you know, more comfortable life, they're able to give  to things that they care about, you know, the ranch is going to be successful to another  generation.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:04:24):**  You know, I think that's what that's what gets me out of bed.  You know, kind of dancing around something that's important and is a big part of the  class.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:04:33):**  You guys do spend I mean, we talked about you know, you spend time on economics on grazing  to spend time on ecology, but there's also a very significant amount of time spent on  focusing on quality of Yeah, well, that's been huge for me.  
**[1:04:45-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:04:45):**  What ck give us some examples when when you say  Yeah, um, one of the exercises we did was working on the business and working in the  business and even though I don't have a ranch or anything, but I am helping ranchers daily.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:05:00):**  And so I think one thing thing I've had to realize, like, in my even in my personal life,  I have to prioritize my time when I want things to get done.  Instead of just doing a low level things of checking my emails and making sure everyone's  
**[1:05:14-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:05:14):**  been responded to making sure everyone's happy, I have to go and make sure like for me, I  spend my first 20 minutes every morning before I log on to my computer, just my coffee sitting  at, at the desk doing nothing.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:05:29):**  Just kind of, you know, if that makes any sense, just like pairing my mindset for the  day.  It's helped me and like, planning the whole week out, which I know it's only like, what  
**[1:05:41-1:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:05:41):**  did you suggest two days a week or something like that, not that we're prescribing anything,  but I did think about like high level stuff, not just jumping into the work doing the menial  task, but like actually setting the high IQ stuff for the first thing in the morning.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:05:55):**  And then I realized I do depreciate at the end of the day, like right now, like it's  my weekend, I'm ready to be done.  So if we could wrap this up, guys.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:03):**  No, I'm kidding.  You're looking at me or 30.  No, but that is something that if I have an important meeting or like someone that I really  
**[1:06:13-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:13):**  want to close or you know, join the platform.  I said that for Monday or Tuesday, first thing in the morning, I definitely won't do it Thursday  or Friday, because I realized that those are days of the week that maybe I'm not gonna  
**[1:06:25-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:25):**  be performing my best.  So I know I explained that too much.  But that is something that I took away from Rancho to profit.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:32):**  Cool.  That's good stuff.  Yeah, we do.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:35):**  Yeah, we spent quite a bit of time on the people side of the business.  There's an interesting question that I like to ask when I have a room full of ranchers.  And I asked them, think of somebody or people that you know, that are no longer ranching.  
**[1:06:51-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:06:51):**  And let's think about what caused the demise of that ranching business.  Was it that there was no way economically to put together, you know, a plan that would  economically work?  
**[1:07:03-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:03):**  You know, it was just completely impossible.  Or was it because the weeds all took over and the soil all blew away, right?  And the ranch was nothing was left.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:13):**  Or the grazing wasn't right.  You know, and they just they just couldn't get any animal performance or anything like  that.  
**[1:07:18-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:18):**  Or was it because the people couldn't get along, distrust brewed, you know, you started  to have people pulling in different directions.  And, and it's almost always comes that the things that pull businesses apart are almost  
**[1:07:30-1:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:30):**  always people related.  And then on the converse of that, the things where businesses really succeed well, are  almost always because they got the people pieces right.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:40):**  So we spent quite a bit of time on the on the people side.  And, you know, working on the business, working in the business is one of those things, you  know, doing the things that really need to be done and, and being disciplined enough  
**[1:07:51-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:51):**  to find the time to do it.  But another thing we talked quite a bit about is are the bigger picture items like mission  and vision?  
**[1:07:58-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:07:58):**  You know, what is the purpose of your business?  Why do you do it?  What, you know, where are we headed and create that shared vision among among the key players?  
**[1:08:06-1:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:06):**  And that that's really what keeps people coming back and bringing their best to any kind of  effort are are having those things.  And, and then we throughout the week, we slip in some some real tools that people can use  
**[1:08:17-1:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:17):**  to drive their businesses forward.  And I mean, all these tools are based on a lot of the popular management books, you know,  whether it's Crucial Conversations, or Seven Habits, or, you know, email, or all those  
**[1:08:29-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:29):**  things that we draw on, but but hopefully, when people leave the school, they go home  and start applying these tools to decision making in their business and, and find it  that through that they get more clarity on where they're headed that that people have  
**[1:08:43-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:43):**  more buy in because yeah, decision making.  Yeah, I think.  So I think one thing that I've also realized is one thing you said, be not you said this  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:54):**  now, but begin with the end in mind.  And I think that just correlates to your mission.  Like, what is your mission?  
**[1:08:59-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:08:59):**  What are you guys working on?  What is your goal?  So like, if you're a cow calf operation, you're gonna have calves every year, hopefully less  
**[1:09:07-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:07):**  than that, right.  And so I think that one thing that's really helped me too, is you've said, you know, if  you want to be profitable, you need a plan for profit.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:16):**  And I think that was that was a huge aha moment for me, because I was just thought, well,  if I get lucky, I'll be profitable.  And it's like, no, that's not the mindset we should have going into this.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:27):**  So what do you think?  Do you think other ranchers finally resonated with that too?  When we talked about mission and vision?  
**[1:09:34-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:34):**  Yeah, they have that that profit target is a pretty powerful thing.  And when people apply that it's amazing how many times we can hit it.  I've been found it in my own life in my own business.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:45):**  You know, when I sit down, I when we start running a year here with ranching for profit,  I have a target in mind, and this is what we want to hit.  And then we build the business based on that.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:09:56):**  You know, how many schools are we going to do?  How many people do we want to have in the L?  You know, how many workshops we're going to do this year?  
**[1:10:03-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:03):**  What's what does it look like?  And it's built around that profit targeted.  And you can do the same thing in an ag business instead of, you know, most people just say,  
**[1:10:11-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:11):**  okay, we're going to do what we do this year.  And we hope there's going to be something left at the end.  And that's not a way to you start with the end in mind, like you said, CK and, and let's  
**[1:10:21-1:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:21):**  build that profit target, and then work backwards from there and design a business that will  do that.  I think that's something really important that a lot of people miss.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:28):**  They just think that profit is what's left of year and profit is something budgeted for  in the beginning of the accountant.  You were part of the L when we did the profit first book, weren't you Brian?  
**[1:10:39-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:39):**  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay, that that was a fun deal.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:43):**  We did it as a continuing ad at executive link.  And some of your listeners might enjoy getting that book.  It's a book called profit first.  
**[1:10:51-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:10:51):**  And we we sent it to all the L members, and then we had a discussion on it.  And what he has you do is he actually has you set up five bank accounts, and and there's  one bank account where all the income lands.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:11:04):**  And then from that bank account, you allocate that income to these remaining four accounts.  And you can you can apply it in several different ways.  But the five accounts are kind of the core ones.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:11:15):**  And one of those accounts is called profit.  And so what he has you do is you pull your profit right off the top before you start  allocating to these other bank accounts.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:11:25):**  And then one of those bank accounts is called your operating expense, opex.  And so you run your business, you run your business out of opex.  And it's based on the on the theory and he Parkinson's law is what he called it.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:11:39):**  And he said Parkinson's law is that you will spend money as long as there's money to spend.  Yeah.  And we everybody can think about this in their own.  
**[1:11:50-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:11:50):**  You know, when your bank account up, you kind of have this idea of Yeah, you know, and now  you kind of walking through and all of a sudden this thing that felt too expensive a few months  ago, you know, you're pulling the trigger on it.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:02):**  And cows over.  Yeah.  How about that set of Longhorns, or according to his friend.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:09):**  So so his the philosophy on this is that you set up these accounts, and you stick that  money in there.  And the only account you can look at is this opex.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:17):**  And that's what you run your business.  And then lo and behold, at the end of the year, when you get there, you've got your  profit set aside.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:23):**  And the other accounts are owners comp.  So you move your compensation as an owner.  And that's what you write your paycheck out of every month is that account.  
**[1:12:33-1:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:33):**  And that goes to you.  And then the other account is a tax hold account.  So you've got money set aside and protected to pay your tax.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:39):**  Good advice.  That's a that's kind of almost a Dave Ramsey.  It is it's very similar, similar to his envelopes, where you get you do the envelope budgeting.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:47):**  So it's just envelopes with bank accounts.  Yeah.  And you can't do same, same theory.  
**[1:12:53-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:12:53):**  So I'm not gonna ask you who you'd have dinner with, as we just did that one last week with  area.  But hold on, hold on.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:01):**  No, I'll leave it.  I was going to stoop too low.  And I'll stop.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:06):**  There's always the aftership.  So now let's I'm just gonna put you in charge.  What's the first change you're gonna make to start making a world better place?  
**[1:13:17-1:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:17):**  I'm just gonna keep doing my thing, man.  I think if, if we help one rancher at a time, you know, we will have have met our mission  and, and our the mission of RMC isn't to change the world.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:33):**  We're not out there to save them.  We're out there to help individual ranchers save their ranches.  And so if that's what we can do, we've met our mission.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:42):**  So so that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to I'm going to try to be a good husband to my wife and a good dad to my awesome.  I love it.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:48):**  But can't wait to be a part.  No, that's not right.  I'm enjoying watching your success.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:13:55):**  And I think the whole community is excited for you to be at the helm of RMC for profit  seeing how you how you put your own unique stamp on the curriculum and the program and  development.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:07):**  So we'll turn it over to you.  So this is the part of the show where you get to ask us questions.  All right.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:13):**  So let's, let's play around with this.  So I'm just gonna get right into some of the deeper stuff.  Brian, you brought up some the mental health thing in the piece of that.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:23):**  And I've been thinking a lot about that in in agriculture, the people that I get to work  with.  I mean, what are some of your thoughts on on struggles that you've seen people have?  
**[1:14:34-1:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:34):**  How are they, you know, this prideful group in agriculture that we, you know, so often  it's just the shut shoving under the rug.  We have a really lumpy rug.  
**[1:14:44-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:44):**  What's been your experience with that?  I guess I'll just I'll just open it up that way.  I'm probably not a very good guy to ask because, wow, wow.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:14:52):**  I'll say this resources.  Resources in rural America are very hard to come by, you know, therapists, you know, that  there's a definite mean for qualified therapists, qualified family therapists to help some of  
**[1:15:06-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:15:06):**  us work through succession issues or conflicting personality issues.  That help is really difficult to get out here with with Zoom and high speed Internet.  You know, it's more available for some, but still, you know, those kinds of professionals  
**[1:15:23-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:15:23):**  just don't really exist.  Really reachable or they're on the wrong side of a state line and they don't have they don't  have governmental permission to practice or trade because of a line on them.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:15:33):**  And I think also it is because of some of the traditional culture surrounding agriculture  that, you know, a lot of the pioneers and a lot of the original farmers of ranchers  that came to the American West came out here because they wanted to be independent, because  
**[1:15:48-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:15:48):**  they wanted to make their own way and not rely on anybody else.  And some of that attitude is carried over through the generation that, you know, we  think that we know this and we got that and we don't need any help that, you know, but  
**[1:16:01-1:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:01):**  the way we've been taught to do it is the best way.  To some extent, our egos get in the way and we need to put ego aside and be willing to  be challenged on our production practice, be willing to be challenged on the things  
**[1:16:14-1:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:14):**  that we've been doing.  Are we doing them right?  Or is there a better way?  
**[1:16:18-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:18):**  And, you know, kind of continuing the conversation.  You know, I can see where it's really difficult for a young person to be able to have some  support to want to try something to go out and try some of these paradigm challenging  
**[1:16:31-1:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:31):**  practices that we talk about here on this podcast or that you guys talk about that you  lead people to discover ranching for profit or that Clay Connery talks about on working  cows.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:40):**  You know, there's not a lot of support for that, you know, so where do these young people  go to talk about some of these ideas?  They can't go to the coffee shop co-op because they're going to run into the same problem  
**[1:16:49-1:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:16:49):**  that I am with paradigms, people not willing to be different.  So it's a thorny issue to tackle and it's complex, but I see that there's a positive  direction as far as, you know, through the last year with COVID, you know, we've gotten  
**[1:17:05-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:17:05):**  a lot of attention in the ag sector, you know, even mental health, the dairy farmers and  there's ultra high suicide rates.  It got some press attention and I think there's some conversation going about mental health.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:17:17):**  Jason Meadows has a great podcast.  I'm going to be on that Ag State of Mind and he centers on, you know, talking about some  of these emotional and ego issues in ag.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:17:27):**  C.K., do you have any experience or thoughts on that?  I just, I think there's a lot of, especially with, you know, I'm one of these young, newer  people in the industry and I actually, I didn't come from the ag background either.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:17:39):**  And I finally, I think it took me six years to get confidence.  And so I did struggle with being a valid member in the community, even though I knew a lot  and I had garnered a lot of experience from failing at things and also being successful  
**[1:17:56-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:17:56):**  at things.  And so I think, you know, that's the main reason for this podcast too, Brian, is we're  trying to, and Dallas, but Brian and I want to create this community with listeners and  
**[1:18:09-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:18:09):**  people who are going to join the show to be able to be vulnerable, but not be judged.  And then we can all learn from that because I think that we don't, we don't really have  a place like, you know, COVID, we can't go to conventions.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:18:23):**  We can't sit and have drinks and then finally let down our guard and actually talk about  what's been going on in our operation.  And I think it does take quite a few touch points with ranchers and other people that  
**[1:18:36-1:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:18:36):**  are outside their community before they really trust someone.  And like, even with me, when I need new ranchers, you know, I could be working with them for  six months and then finally they tell me this huge bomb of like, yeah, well, this is actually  
**[1:18:50-1:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:18:50):**  the dynamic we're dealing with and we're trying to accomplish this goal here.  And I'm like, oh, I wish, you know, I could have been able to support you sooner through  this.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:18:59):**  Please let me know how I can help best.  And I think, you know, Brian, you and I have been kind of, we worked together for years  and didn't even talk to each other, right?  
**[1:19:08-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:19:08):**  Because it wasn't until Pashmeth was being sold and getting a new company.  And then I went and visited your branch that you and I really became close.  So it's like, how do we build a bridge for those things for us to connect with other  
**[1:19:20-1:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:19:20):**  people?  And, and kind of, you know, what do you say?  We're a minority, Brian.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:19:27):**  So I think we do need to, yeah, we need to, you know, all be very aware that, that it's,  it's probably all 2% of us that are having mental health issues.  And it is okay to talk about it.  
**[1:19:40-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:19:40):**  Yeah.  I appreciate you guys being open for that.  So, I mean, I, I, I don't have any personal experience with those kinds of struggles,  
**[1:19:50-1:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:19:50):**  but I have a lot of the people who I look up to the most, I mean, some of these ranchers  that are doing incredible things and, and, or, you know, so some of the people who I  look up to the most are struggling.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:04):**  And then as I look out further, I see it, it's so common.  And so I really think we need to start normalizing the conversation around it.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:13-1:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:13):**  And, and, and, you know, it, it's the, the stigma starts to go away.  So, so I, I appreciate that.  So, so let's pull it up from there to maybe I want to ask you guys, I mean, you guys get  
**[1:20:24-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:24):**  to see and talk to a lot of people that are leading in agriculture and ranching.  What are some commonalities as you look to people that are, that are pushing and, and,  and kind of leading?  
**[1:20:37-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:37):**  What are some commonalities in that group?  They can deal with criticism.  They can deal with criticism from the people that are afraid of change.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:47):**  The last several episodes we've had, and I don't, I don't want to give too much away,  but, uh, you know, we've had some really fantastic guests.  I mentioned Ariel Greenwood.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:20:55):**  We've had Macaulay Kincaid, uh, a guy named Hoz Magaray, a butcher at this time, uh, another  friend of mine named Michael Kinsey.  And we've had Mike Calacrate on and they've just been fantastic guests.  
**[1:21:06-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:06):**  And you know, you know, Mike, you know, he's, he's one of the old war horses.  I mean, he's been there, he's been in the trenches, he's fought the fight.  He's, you know, he's taken, taken the Packers to the Supreme fricking court.  
**[1:21:19-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:19):**  And you know, some of these other guys, uh, the first three people that we had that we're  going to have on our podcast after Clay and episode zero.  So episodes one, two, and three, there's about 10 years total of, of experience.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:31):**  So you know, we really, I think we're, we're doing a good job of getting some of these  stories out and, and trying to build a good community that's willing to be open and vulnerable  and talk.  
**[1:21:42-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:42):**  Is anything good for you?  CK?  What are some commonalities?  
**[1:21:46-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:46):**  I think they all just want to have a better life.  Like at the end of the day, they, they aren't, um, they aren't, you know, trying to ruin  the environment.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:21:56):**  And so I do, I think it doesn't, if I could piggyback off of the criticism thing, I do  see a lot of criticism on like social media and even with ranchers to ranchers, they're  like, Oh, why would you ever, uh, feed like grain to your cattle?  
**[1:22:11-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:22:11):**  You know, like anti-grain people.  And um, I think, you know, the goal is we want to leave the place better than when we  left it.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:22:19):**  And I think if there's, if it's a, if it's a small step towards, uh, you know, doing  that is to me, that's a win.  And I think, you know, I have ranchers that they come from every spectrum, every, every  
**[1:22:31-1:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:22:31):**  land dynamic and family dynamic.  Um, and so I think it's always, we will, we want to improve, like we want to be better.  We don't, you know, obviously don't want to go backwards or we'll only be having this  
**[1:22:42-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:22:42):**  conversation.  So, yeah.  I think one of the keys is, it's not, you know, not having these conversations and trying  
**[1:22:50-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:22:50):**  to vilify or throw blame.  I think it's important to avoid that.  And I think that the direction that it's better to go is to encourage people to ask questions.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:00):**  Yeah.  You know, it's one of the things that you learn.  It's one of the things you learn, excuse me, in the course.  
**[1:23:08-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:08):**  And I love to quote Stan Parsons on that, that the truth cannot be taught.  It must be discovered.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:16):**  And you know, like you said, like you mentioned earlier, Dallas, the course is not prescriptive.  It doesn't give you the magic bullet.  It just hands you a toolbox that you can choose to use or not.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:28):**  So what's something that your listeners don't know about you guys, maybe outside of your  ranching agricultural life, hobbies, things like that?  What's something that maybe they don't know about you yet?  
**[1:23:41-1:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:41):**  You know, I haven't had much time for hobbies for about five years since I got real deep  in my last tree clearing project.  And that led into a wildfire, which led into wildfire recovery, which led into another  
**[1:23:54-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:23:54):**  tree clearing project, which led into grazing.  So I really don't know.  Do you have something that you maybe you're looking at that maybe, Hey, I think maybe  
**[1:24:04-1:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:04):**  I'll get into this as things slow down in your professional life?  Well, other than starting up a podcast, thank you quite a bit of time.  I want to take this opportunity to thank you for encouraging me to do this several times  
**[1:24:20-1:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:20):**  over the last six years.  Nice.  Yeah.  
**[1:24:23-1:24:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:23):**  If you're out there listening and you're wondering why I did this, y'all can blame Dallas, direct  all hate mail, Alice Mount care of Weisland, Wyoming.  So the truth is, I was considering hiring you to do this for ranching for profit.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:37):**  And you decided to do it as Brian and CK.  So you know, when this thing goes, is the top podcast on the Apple playlist, I'm going  to be really mad at you.  
**[1:24:48-1:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:48):**  You know that right?  We're gonna make millions get sold to Spotify, but not with any censoring.  We'll give you a percentage.  
**[1:24:58-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:24:58):**  There we go.  Oh, it's $1 for every time we say ranching for profit.  Okay.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:04):**  You keep track.  I want to applaud you.  What a what a cool thing and to take an idea and run with it.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:13):**  I totally support it.  But you guys are, you know, I had after you here a few months ago, and you know, we did  kind of discuss it in person a little bit not very long after that.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:22):**  CK and I really started talking.  Yeah, she came back about a month ago with an opportunity that really pretty much a proposal  I couldn't refuse.  
**[1:25:29-1:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:29):**  And I had to do like, I want to do like an office hours or something that connects ranchers  with rangers.  And we just talk shop.  
**[1:25:37-1:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:37):**  We don't have to talk about anything that we do.  But we just we're just missing that.  And I mean, I, you know, you do get tired of going into like conventions and trade shows  
**[1:25:47-1:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:47):**  because they're all during the same season, right?  But I I'm like, wow, I haven't seen a trade show.  Besides like the zoom ones, which Brian and I are zoomed out a little bit.  
**[1:25:57-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:25:57):**  You can only you know, do that so much when you miss the actual like nuances of you know,  just talking shop and and laughing about random things.  So yeah, I miss you guys.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:10):**  So much.  I'll see you in like three weeks Dallas.  I don't know.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:15):**  I miss you guys.  But it's also almost the weekend.  So can we?  
**[1:26:19-1:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:19):**  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  No.  
**[1:26:22-1:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:22):**  No, no, no.  So before we before I have CK take us out Dallas, where can our listeners find you any  website resource product you want to talk about real quick to send people?  
**[1:26:33-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:33):**  Sure.  ranchingforprofit.com ranchmanagement.com.  We those will take you to our site where we have everything.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:39):**  You know, if you haven't been to the school, get to the school if you're in the ranching  business, you need to come it.  Yes, it's a commitment, a financial commitment, probably the bigger commitment is finding  
**[1:26:52-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:26:52):**  a way to organize your life to get you away from the ranch.  But But really, if your ranch really is a business, or if it's going to be a business,  finding a week for professional development should be a part of any normal business owners  
**[1:27:06-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:06):**  routine.  This really shouldn't be an exception.  It should be more of the rules.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:11):**  So if it really is going to be a business, come you won't regret it.  For those people that have been to the school, if they're not aware of it yet, I want to  point out we just came out with a new resource called RFP online.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:23):**  When all the Coronavirus stuff hit, we got a lot of pressure to start doing the school  online.  And and maybe it's my paradigms blocking me, but I just can't see how you can have  
**[1:27:33-1:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:33):**  it's not the same.  It's not how you can change paradigms.  I can't.  
**[1:27:38-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:38):**  I love you, Dallas, but I can't sit with you for six days.  No, but you can make amazing connections.  I'm sorry, you make amazing connections that I still have with the people I sat with around  
**[1:27:48-1:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:48):**  that table and I still think, you know, you just you just do.  I thought the same.  I agree.  
**[1:27:54-1:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:27:54):**  Sorry.  Yeah, I'm glad you guys see it the way I see it.  So so what we did instead is we came up with a an online support curriculum for people  
**[1:28:02-1:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:02):**  that have been through the school and or maybe hitting roadblocks when they start applying.  So so that's out there now.  We decided to make it a subscription based model.  
**[1:28:10-1:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:10):**  So 20 bucks a month and you get access to all the resources.  We do two webinars a month with ranchers who are applying the principles that we teach.  And so if you haven't haven't checked that out yet, go check it out.  
**[1:28:22-1:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:22):**  You know, I almost forgot something, Dallas.  You know, we're talking we're trying to talk about young people and resources.  So last summer, you you did a deal in Wheatland for young folks.  
**[1:28:32-1:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:32):**  You want to talk about that?  And are you going to do it again?  I'd love to talk about it because, yeah, we are going to do it again.  
**[1:28:38-1:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:38):**  And so we call it the business fundamentals for young ranchers is what we're calling it.  It is not a ranching for profit school, but it is it is a glimpse at the ranching for  profit curriculum for young people.  
**[1:28:52-1:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:28:52):**  And we're targeting that age group of 18 to 25.  So those guys that are that are headed off to college or that are maybe, you know, just  right out of college.  
**[1:29:02-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:02):**  And our intent with that is to to wake them up.  That conventional agriculture is probably not the way of the future and and doing the  things your dad and grandpa have always done and carrying that on is probably not going  
**[1:29:16-1:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:16):**  to produce the results that you.  So we just want to plant that seed so that they can as they enter that critical phase  of their life could start seeing things differently and challenging things.  
**[1:29:27-1:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:27):**  So we're scheduled to do that again.  It's actually up in Sheridan, Wyoming, is where it takes place.  And actually, this year, we're doing it on a host ranch in Decker, Montana.  
**[1:29:36-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:36):**  So so just north of Sheraton.  That'll be me.  Oh, it's going to be incredible.  
**[1:29:41-1:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:41):**  June 14, 15, 16, 17.  So it's four days, June 14 through the 17th.  We're going to stay on the ranch camping tents, RVs, whatever you want to do.  
**[1:29:51-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:51):**  We're gonna have somebody come out and cater the whole thing.  So we'll have all the feeding.  The way we do the school is half a day of classroom type stuff.  
**[1:29:59-1:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:29:59):**  So this is going to be sitting around in camp chairs, right?  Looking at flip charts is what it's going to be.  And and then and then flip charts.  
**[1:30:07-1:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:30:07):**  Yeah, the other half a day is on a ranch.  So we've got four host ranches that we go visit over the course of that time.  One of those ranches is the Padlock Ranch, which which is one of the leading ranches  
**[1:30:18-1:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:30:18):**  at applying really cool stuff.  And it's a good sized place too.  So it's fun to go see how they're applying those things.  
**[1:30:24-1:30:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:30:24):**  So So yeah, the business fundamentals for young ranchers.  We're going to fill that within the first few days of registration being open.  Because we already have a waitlist from last year that couldn't come.  
**[1:30:36-1:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:30:36):**  Yeah, last year we ended up with 48 young people from 17 states.  And that was after COVID shut down all of our international people.  So we had people coming from Canada, Australia, Mexico, none of those could get in.  
**[1:30:50-1:31:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:30:50):**  So we went back to our waiting list and filled it from that.  So So yeah, if you're if you're a young person in ranching, you got to you got to come to  that, but you better be on the stick to get signed up when it opens up.  
**[1:31:02-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:02):**  And where can they go to find out more or where do they need to watch for that announcement?  So this is going to air mid March, you said?  Yes, it's going to be full by then.  
**[1:31:14-1:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:14):**  We're opening it up February 15.  And and I suspect we'll be full by then.  But in future years, we're actually looking at adding a second one of these that will  
**[1:31:26-1:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:26):**  do more than so look for that South Dakota grasslands is is contracting with me to do  a school for them.  For young people, same same kind of model, July 13 through the 16th.  
**[1:31:38-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:38):**  So I'm not sure what the availability that would be, but that that might be worth checking.  Awesome.  Awesome.  
**[1:31:44-1:31:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:44):**  Did we leave anything else on the table today, Dallas?  Well, hopefully lots because I want to be on again, so we can talk about more stuff.  Yeah, we'll have to have you on again.  
**[1:31:51-1:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:51):**  It's, you know, it's been a wonderful, wonderful conversation.  We've definitely gone past an hour and a half.  Not that that's a bad thing.  
**[1:31:57-1:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:31:57):**  It's been enjoyable.  I know CK wants to go and get her weekend started down in Aggieville.  So it's been a pleasure.  
**[1:32:04-1:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/7--Dallas-Mount-All-that-matters-is-what-we-do-next-etmuji#t=1:32:04):**  Thank you for joining us.

**[0:00:54-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:00:54):**  And we have a special treat for you today.  My friend Lloyd Bortrager is going to join us from near Hutchison, Kansas.  Lloyd runs a very interesting operation.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:04):**  Been a customer of Lloyd's for a while.  Full disclosure.  He has some wonderful products which I'm sure we'll get to talk about a little bit later  
**[0:01:11-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:11):**  in the show.  So Lloyd, I guess this is kind of part two of our dairy mini-series and we're focusing  on you.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:21):**  So tell us a little bit about yourself Lloyd.  Let's get started.  Well sure.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:28):**  Thanks for having me.  And it's good to be chatting again with good ranching people.  Yeah, I'm Lloyd Bortrager.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:40):**  Living here in central, south central Kansas.  Got a dairy farm I grew up with.  Been on the farm ever since I was a baby.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:01:52):**  Live on the place where I grew up with.  We've gone through quite a few different changes over the years since I was a boy.  And I took on the management skills through transition from my dad.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:02:12):**  And here I am doing all the stuff we've got on our plate today.  So it's been a journey and been a lot of things I've learned over the years.  You know, 37 doesn't seem very old but it does seem like a lot of things have happened  
**[0:02:35-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:02:35):**  from my childhood.  So yeah, it's been a good one.  Learned a lot and I'm glad to be here and not having to relive what I had to learn to  
**[0:02:48-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:02:48):**  get here.  So yeah, just go ahead and where you want to go, Brian.  Well there's quite a bit to unpack from there.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:03:00):**  So let's back up and talk about your education and what the operation was like when you took  over from your dad and how long ago that was.  Okay, so I was involved in the farming all my life.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:03:19):**  I did some off farm jobs through my teenage years but my dad was a conventional dairy  farmer and row crops, hay, you know, it was the bring the feed to the cattle and haul  the manure out type of operation.  
**[0:03:41-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:03:41):**  And so he was what I really, really enjoyed about my dad, he was willing to think of new  ideas and to allow myself to try some new things.  Not that he was really good with it or okay with it but he knew that down the road, me  
**[0:04:02-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:04:02):**  taking on the operation, I needed to do what works for me and otherwise there won't be  a farm left later on if I don't stay.  So that was kind of the thing that led him to allow me to keep on trying new stuff.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:04:19):**  And so yeah, I really got interested in the cattle grazing after being on a tractor most  of my childhood life, you know, plowing the fields, planting, seeding, harvesting and  then, you know, hauling all the manure out and going at it again.  
**[0:04:49-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:04:49):**  And so he was probably, oh, it's been 16 years, I mean, I got married 16 years ago and so  that was the time I kind of took on some management responsibilities and gradually over time took  on more and then in 2011, he got killed in an accident and so all of a sudden I was left  
**[0:05:25-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:05:25):**  with everything.  I had at that point learned most of the things that were going on but he still had some of  his own personal responsibilities that I didn't have, that I hadn't learned yet.  
**[0:05:41-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:05:41):**  So it was a kind of a big load to take on to learn from and to get up to par and so  that was kind of an eye opening for me when everything was on me to decide what to do  was okay, we got to make this work, how do we go about it and how can I keep my foot  
**[0:06:07-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:06:07):**  in the door of the dairy industry.  At that point, I was seeing lots of small dairies going out of business and I knew we  have to keep on staying ahead of the eight ball to keep going.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:06:26):**  So you said small dairy, so like I'm not terribly familiar with dairy operations and how they're  unnecessarily classified.  What would you call a, what are you calling a small dairy operation versus a medium or  
**[0:06:39-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:06:39):**  a large size?  Yeah, well typically back in the day in my childhood days in the community here that  I grew up with, most all the farms in the community, they had a 30 cow dairy and they  
**[0:06:55-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:06:55):**  had their hogs back in the day.  By that time when I came along, the hog price had collapsed and there was no more of that  but they'd have some beef cattle maybe, not a whole lot but their dairy was still the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:07:13):**  focus because that was the family occupation where kids could help, we had to be there  every day and it was kind of the foundation of the farm was the small dairy.  And so yeah, small I would consider 30 cow and medium, you know, you get a lot higher  
**[0:07:40-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:07:40):**  when you go to medium size in reference to, you know, you get past a family farm.  I mean there's, I know like my sister has a farm and they milk up to 200 cows but that's  about as much as you can push it on a family operation otherwise it's more of a commercial.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:08:05):**  So that would kind of be the top end of where a medium size operation would be, would be  200 and around 30 would be a small size operation?  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:08:15):**  But those are probably way outnumbered with the large, you know, even in quantity numbers  there's a thousand cow dairies that are stillâ€¦  Yeah.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:08:31):**  Yeah, I'm not sure we'll ever have one of those on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  So let's talk about your cows.  
**[0:08:46-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:08:46):**  Let's, well, I guess before we get into that we're still kind of talking about how  you got started.  Is there any maybe succession planning or estate planning tips that you learned over  
**[0:09:02-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:09:02):**  the last 10 years when your father passed away that would be a good thing?  Just a little hot take from that?  Yeah, well, the quote that I think Joel Salitan says is when old people can't get out, new  
**[0:09:23-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:09:23):**  people can't get in and I think that meant a whole new level to me when I went through  it because to have the dairy farm as your lifestyle, to have it as, you know, when it's  gone, you know, your lifestyle is gone.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:09:42):**  I know several dairy farmers in the area that have quit but they don't know what to do,  I mean, they didn't know what to do.  I mean, they've kind of tried to learn some new things but it's a lifestyle.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:09:53):**  And so, yeah, I think it's very important for the older generation to realize that times  do change with the young people coming along and not just the young farmers but consumer  demand is a big thing with that.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:10:13):**  That really determines how your farm looks and markets and all the end uses that makes  a really big difference.  And as far as estate planning, yeah, we don't talk about that and that's just something  
**[0:10:34-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:10:34):**  normal we don't talk about and we just keep going and before we know it, it's here and  yeah.  It's just, I advise people talk about it.  
**[0:10:44-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:10:44):**  I know my dad's past and made us as a family, my mom really come up to the planning of the  estate and talking about those things and, you know, really giving an understanding of  what plans are for the future instead of coming to that point and having a surprise that you  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:11:13):**  worked all your life for and it isn't the way it was going to be, how you assumed it  to be.  So, I think that's a big part.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:11:21):**  I think we've kind of heard that before, you know, clear communication early and agreements  and having agreements because expectations lead to disappointments and, you know, I think  that there was a lot of the older generation kind of was of the mindset, well, what do  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:11:43):**  I care?  I'll be gone.  Let the kids figure it out.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:11:49):**  That's really kind of not an appropriate mindset anymore.  We've got to leave things better than we found them and we've got to ensure that the next  generation starts off on the right foot and they're invested in stewarding our resources.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:05):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, okay, now we can talk about your cows because you can't have a dairy operation without  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:14):**  cows.  That's right.  You can milk some almonds, right?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:18):**  Almond milk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:21):**  I'm kidding.  Where are the teats?  I'm kidding.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:24):**  I try to make it the right color and taste the right way.  Yeah.  That's a different thing.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:32):**  So back to the cows.  Sorry.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:36):**  So let's talk about your cows.  Yeah.  To the cows.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:40):**  I love to talk about the cows and especially for all the people who ask about my Oreo cows  that I have out on the pastures and people stopping in and asking, what are those?  What are those?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:12:56):**  Our land just corners up to the highway.  And of course, when they're out in the pasture, they do see those a lot.  So it's good to be exposed, I guess, when you have something special and it draws people.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:13:11):**  So we have what they call Dutch belted cows.  They're more of a older heritage breed cow that's a dual purpose, but they've still been  in the breeding for current day needs.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:13:34):**  So it's not like you have a beef cow you're milking or something like that.  So it is a dairy breed, but more dual purpose than what your typical dairy breeds would  be.  
**[0:13:47-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:13:47):**  So yeah, I got started with those in an interesting way.  And I should maybe just explain the reason we have those and how we came to the conclusion  that's what we want to have.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:14:07):**  So yeah, I'll just back up and kind of talk about how the operation transitioned from  the conventional side like I was talking about.  The cows we had were the Holstein, the big frame spotted black and white cows.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:14:27):**  And we had pretty good genetics.  We just ran a bull.  We didn't have the whole AI breeding like a lot of dairy farmers do to try to really  
**[0:14:44-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:14:44):**  high power your cows to produce more.  So we weren't on that train quite as much, but we still were getting bulls in from those  breeders.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:14:53):**  So definitely conventional dairy cow is what we had.  And so over the years, we wanted to go to a more grass based operation and with the  conventional cows, we didn't want to use those as much as possible just because they don't  
**[0:15:19-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:15:19):**  have the ability to go out and use energy, graze and keep milk production plus keep body  condition.  So that was kind of the first thing I saw kind of playing around with grazing was that.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:15:37):**  And you'd have your thinner cows and that's typically what most dairy farmers will tell  you when you talk about the whole grazing thing.  Oh, you're going to have some thin cows and they're not going to breed back and all that.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:15:56):**  So that was kind of the thing we had to work against.  And I'll probably later explain more why we wanted to go to grass based dairy.  But for now, I'll talk about the cows.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:16:10):**  And I was looking at different cows or different breeds.  And it was at that time a magazine came out.  I forget the name of the magazine, but it was one of the agriculture magazines.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:16:29):**  But there was this article in there that had the story of a farmer who had these Dutch  bellied cows and they were so highly reproductive that he could sell most of his herd and he'd  have enough heifer calves come along that he could take a break and have a new herd  
**[0:16:50-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:16:50):**  going in a year or two and he'd take a break and he was able to do that.  And I thought a dairy farmer having a break, who does that ever?  So that really attracted me, just the high reproduction of them.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:17:05):**  He just, yeah, he mentioned how highly reproductive they were and get a lot more calves out of  them.  So I started looking through that breed and came across a bull that was available closer  
**[0:17:21-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:17:21):**  to the to my area.  Most of the bulls I have to go out of state for.  But this was actually someone in the state who had one.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:17:31):**  And so I decided, here we go, we're just going to breed this bull to my cow herd and see  what we get.  We're just going to try it.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:17:40):**  And so we definitely saw a big change in the calves when they started having the little  ones.  They were much stronger, healthier and were more beefy, they looked a lot better and they  
**[0:17:59-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:17:59):**  just did a lot better.  And so we decided we're going to go all in and keep breeding our cows.  And so we sold off the bigger framed Holstein cows and kept the smaller framed, more beefy  
**[0:18:23-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:18:23):**  looking cows than what the other ones were.  And we just got rid of those.  And it has gone from the Holstein herd and we've just been crossing them back to the  
**[0:18:40-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:18:40):**  belted bulls and we're now in our fourth, fifth generation.  So actually fourth, we're just on our fourth now.  So I think fifth is when they call them purebred.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:18:51):**  So we keep papers on them just because the breed is, the numbers are small enough that  they want to try to keep them all registered as much as possible.  And it does add value to them as well for people who are looking for it.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:19:07):**  So how many generations of breeding did it take for you to find your ideal cows, the  ones that fit your phenotype that were successful on your forage?  Well, so the cows, the first cross were what they call a hybrid, which I still have a lot  
**[0:19:28-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:19:28):**  of those.  And so not as just as much as the breed goes, but as selection of genetics go to kind of  see which cows keep their body condition and keeping a cow that's not as tall.  
**[0:19:48-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:19:48):**  And so we've kept those and those really have done well for us.  The first cross, we still have quite a few of those, but they just keep milking more  and more.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:20:05):**  And we're like, okay, we thought most dairy cows kind of dwindle off after they get that  old but they just keep going.  So I really like the third generation.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:20:19):**  You do have some on the second generation or on the first cross, you have more of the  hybrid vigor.  The second cross, you have some of the diluting effect of both breeds.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:20:32):**  And then after that is when I really, really like what I'm seeing.  They're more of a beefier animal and they're just a lot stronger.  So that's what I like.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:20:46):**  Well, one of the questions that I had written down to ask from the paddock was, how do you  breed and what are you primarily selecting for?  And I think you really nail it there.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:20:57):**  So what are you noticing about the longevity of your Dutch Beltese as you're coming down  the generations and their staying power as far as milking ability?  Well, I haven't figured out.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:21:09):**  I haven't really seen that yet simply because even on the third generations, I still had  some taller cows that I didn't like as much.  And I just sold those to a crossbred dairy farm in Texas.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:21:30):**  And I've just kept the older ones.  And they're up there in nine years of age now and they're still going strong.  And it's not something that you'll hear many dairy farmers talk about is a cow that will  
**[0:21:49-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:21:49):**  keep going strong for that long.  I think the typical lactation is like barely two lactations, two years of milking and then  they're done.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:22:02):**  Right.  So here-  When you mentioned strong, Lloyd, you mean like longevity, right?  
**[0:22:08-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:22:08):**  Not necessarily structural or-  Yeah, they're just a lot hardier.  Hardier would be the better word than strong because they just, you know, if there's a  
**[0:22:18-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:22:18):**  weather event, if there's, you know, where other cows would get stressed a lot more,  it doesn't bother them near as much.  So that's my terminology of that.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:22:33):**  And you said you were getting eight, nine lactations out of a cow?  Well, that's the most we've had.  We haven't really, I mean, we're still keeping them as long as they go, as long as they're  
**[0:22:46-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:22:46):**  doing okay, we're going to keep them.  And the heifers, the young mamas, which we call the heifers that come along and have  their first baby, they won't milk as much.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:04):**  The further I get into purebred, they won't milk as much, but every lactation, they do  better and better.  They milk more and more.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:13):**  And so I think time, of course, is in the favor of these cows to keep them going.  You're getting a calf every year from them.  It's not like you're just not getting much out of them, you know, the milk part of it,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:31):**  but these calves are worth a lot too.  And so that's a big part of it too.  A Dutch beltie calf is probably, bull calf or steer calf is probably worth a whole bunch  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:42):**  more than a Holstein.  Yes, yes, absolutely.  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:46):**  We get two markets from them, right?  That's right.  That's right.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:51):**  We don't care if it's a bull or a heifer.  They're both worth good money.  So they're, yeah, we'll take both.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:23:59):**  So Lloyd, can we talk about your family a little bit?  Like what does your family unit look like?  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:24:07):**  Well, like I said, I've been married for 16 years and have five kids.  So we have three girls and those are the older ones and then the two boys, which are the  younger ones.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:24:24):**  And then my mom also lives on the farm yet.  So she's still active and helping out.  So we're all on the farm and it's mostly the family that's doing it.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:24:39):**  We do have some help here in the last year.  We did start to hire some outside help, but yeah, it's been in the family, kind of a family  operation for all my years.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:24:55):**  And yeah.  So everyone does their own type of chore, like they have their own responsibilities  that they need to do.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:25:03):**  Yes, yes, yes.  So the typical day would be, we get up and so another thing we do on the chores part  of it is we only milk these cows once a day.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:25:20):**  And that makes it a lot easier for the family to only milk cows once a day.  And so we do that in the morning, we get up and milk the cows.  My oldest daughter does a lot of the milking and a lot of, yeah, she does a lot of the  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:25:41):**  milking.  Then the three middle ones do the calves.  So we feed the calves their milk and so that's their chore.  
**[0:25:49-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:25:49):**  And then we have some other small animals, rabbits and things like that and chickens.  And so in the evening, the calves get milk and the chickens, the layer chickens are the  chore for the evening for the eggs.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:26:06):**  So yeah, it's a great place to have the children involved and yeah, kind of learn from young,  from the young age to visualize what's out there and kind of see, you know, how they  contribute to the society or to the farm or, you know, to the family especially to be able  
**[0:26:33-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:26:33):**  to actually tell people they help grow food, you know, when they're that young.  Yeah, and know where their food comes from.  Absolutely.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:26:43):**  So do you have any of your kids that have interest in like taking over for the next  succession or is it what I hear in conventional models is a lot of people want to leave, they  couldn't leave soon enough and they don't want to come back to the family farm.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:26:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  Well that part is, I mean, my oldest is, she's really matured.  She's the oldest and, you know, she's only 13.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:27:16):**  So yeah, there's a lot of life ahead of her.  Yeah.  It does definitely, but the nice thing about what we have going here, we have so many opportunities  
**[0:27:30-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:27:30):**  here.  It's not like, okay, we're a dairy farm and all that you need to know to enterprise.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:27:39):**  All you need to know to work here is how to milk cows.  It's not that.  So, so like when we started with the technology thing with our model of the farm, there's  
**[0:27:50-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:27:50):**  a lot of technology experience needed as well.  And so that's where they come in and you know, where that will lead them later on in life,  I don't know.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:28:01):**  But we do have lots of opportunity here with the way we not just produce food, but the  way we sell food.  So all the food we produce gets sold directly to consumers.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:28:18):**  So that makes a big opportunity, you know, whether it's marketing, whether it's processing  or whether it's writing blogs or talking with customers or speaking, giving tours.  I mean, they've had all those experiences, you know, just in their childhood already  
**[0:28:40-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:28:40):**  and not saying there's not something else to do when they get older outside of the farm,  but it does at least give them tremendous opportunity.  Especially because they'll have experience in the different roles.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:28:54):**  Right?  So I think that's one thing like, so like my husband and his family, he comes from a  family of there's nine of them.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:29:01):**  So he's in the middle and he has eight siblings, but they're all so well-rounded and they can  do almost everything in the universe and it's kind of crazy that they know how to do almost  everything.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:29:14):**  But they've also just chosen different career paths too.  And I think that just goes to the resiliency that they have.  And I'm assuming farm kids too, because they always just, they're more confident in learning  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:29:29):**  something new because they have all these roles handed.  Yeah.  Yep.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:29:34):**  And my wife does homeschool all the kids.  She was a teacher before we got, well, just after we got married.  She taught some school a little bit before I tugged her back on the farm, but she did  
**[0:29:50-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:29:50):**  say, you know, after that, I want to teach my own kids.  And so she's been doing that and just being able to a lot of hands-on things here on the  farm that they can learn as well through that.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:06):**  And I think it's a great, great thing.  Yeah.  So I imagine COVID was like no change for you guys.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:12):**  It was just business as usual.  Yeah.  We're like, what's going on out there?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:17):**  People are coming and coming scared and food insecure.  And I was like, what?  You don't have a TV, do you?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:28):**  We did realize the extent of it when our shelves started to get empty and realized, oh, okay.  This is something more serious than what we thought it was.  Right.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:41):**  Yeah.  You must not have a television.  Well, we do, but we turn it off.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:49):**  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Where are we going?  
**[0:30:53-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:30:53):**  Okay.  Hey, we're doing an interview here.  So yeah, when I was there, I saw the chickens, I saw the pigs.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:31:08):**  I didn't know you guys had rabbits.  So eventually I want to kind of get into your store and start talking about some of the  products that you have in there and what that's done for your community.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:31:23):**  So can you talk a little bit about how the chickens and pigs fit into the big picture  to cycle excess biology and other things?  Yeah.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:31:34):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So our operation is definitely centered around the dairy farm, but it does create some byproduct  
**[0:31:42-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:31:42):**  just due to the processing of the dairy.  So we make cheese and butter.  And so that does create some byproducts, skim milk and whey.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:31:56):**  And what's the best animal to use that up?  And it's hogs.  So keeping the byproduct on the farm instead of hauling it off as a waste product, you  
**[0:32:10-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:32:10):**  can value add a lot to that.  So the pigs kind of take on that responsibility of the byproduct, of course they get a grain  as well with it.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:32:23):**  But the layer chickens, of course, they follow the cows on pasture, scratch around the manure  pats and all that.  And we can kind of take them on with the cows.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:32:39):**  So it's another way of kind of adding enterprise to what you already have and it just co-exists  with each other.  So that's typically the reason for that.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:32:53):**  I mean, we've got bees on the farm because the way we graze, there's flowers.  But one thing that we have learned, we don't have to do it all ourselves.  Like the bees, we don't have to go out and take care of the beehives.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:33:08):**  We have someone else does that who's a beekeeper.  So that's one big thing we've learned with the diversity of nature is really, really  good, but you can't be over diversified in your own schedule, of course, to keep.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:33:30):**  Because the more you get over diversified, the less you become...  You can only do so much.  That's right.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:33:35):**  When do you sleep?  That's right.  When you sleep.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:33:38):**  Yes.  And the other thing is you're not going to become better at what you're doing if you're  trying constantly to try going to the next thing or this thing and not taking care of  
**[0:33:50-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:33:50):**  what you already have and making it better.  That is also a big part of the profit thing is to become better at what you are instead  of keeping on with something new all the time.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:34:06):**  So yeah, kind of how...  And then of course the carbon cycle plays a big role as I was talking with you, Brian,  when we were here about the wood chip thing, the carbon cycle and how the pigs help compost  
**[0:34:26-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:34:26):**  the manure, turning the compost and breaking it down and the chickens as well.  But bringing in carbon to add to the manure from dairy cows.  There's times when they're in through the winter or very wet times, they'll be in on  
**[0:34:49-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:34:49):**  a wood chip packed area where it can soak up all the nutrients and keep it stable and  keep it from causing ammonia smells also creates a lot of diversity for biology when you take  that back out to the fields, to the paddocks.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:13):**  So that also contributes to the overall diversity of the farm.  So and then you mentioned rabbits.  I wish I could say they fit exactly into the dairy, but they fit into the dairyman's kid  
**[0:35:31-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:31):**  or childhood, I guess I should say.  The dairyman's childhood was rabbits and he never outgrew it.  So here we are doing rabbits.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:41):**  Those are just...  There's nothing wrong with that.  Don't let anybody tell you there is.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:44):**  I love rabbit stew.  You eat them, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:47):**  Yeah, I like rabbit stew.  I think he's just like, yeah, I like rabbit stew.  I think he's just like chicken.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:52):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're, they're a lot, in my opinion, a lot cleaner than chicken.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:35:58):**  So absolutely.  Yes.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:36:01):**  And they're more of a forage when you compare them to like a broiler chicken, they're more  of a forager than they are, than a broiler is, of course.  And so yeah, we have some wild rabbits in our backyard and I just, I really want to  
**[0:36:16-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:36:16):**  shoot them because they've ruined all of my vegetable garden and everything.  And I'm like, I had to like cage things off and they still figure out how to get them  right there.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:36:28):**  And it's really annoying.  Yeah.  Well, they would be vegetarian fed then.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:36:33):**  Absolutely.  No, we, our rabbits are just under fruit trees, our fruit tree area, and we have movable pens  where we move them every day and, and, you know, they'll, they'll eat the grass and,  
**[0:36:48-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:36:48):**  and leave their fertilizer behind.  So yeah, we're still, we're still learning on that with, with moving them around.  The ideal pen for rabbits on the ground is, is yet to be determined for us, you know,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:37:04):**  to keep a big, they need a floor so they don't dig out and yet they, you want them as big  of a hole or the slats or the netting to be big enough where they can still eat the grass  that's underneath.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:37:17):**  And so, um, too big, you know, they'll have a little more trouble moving them, but, uh,  too small, they won't be able to get their, their feed.  So interesting.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:37:29):**  Interesting.  So, um, you mentioned you feed a little grain to your pigs.  What about your cows?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah, the cows, uh, do not get any grain, uh, through the, through the summer.  They're, they're strictly on pasture and hay.  Uh, we do have my, my uncle does my hay making for me.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:37:54):**  So I, uh, Is that from your farm or?  Yes.  Most, most all comes from my farm.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:38:02):**  And, uh, one of the reasons for that is we're able to keep our paddocks, uh, so through,  through, so right now we've got way more grass than we could ever use and to keep it dairy  quality for dairy grazing, um, either clip it or, or have it hayed.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:38:24):**  And then the new growth can come and we could, we can graze that later in the summer and  the, the hay, the hay we can use through the winter, of course.  But, um, my uncle does that and as a custom contractor for me, so I, I don't have to have  
**[0:38:42-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:38:42):**  all the equipment, which I'm happy with.  And uh, and then through the winter, of course we will feed the hay.  They're still out on, on pasture as much as possible.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:38:54):**  Um, but then we'll also feed a, a sprouted seed, what they call a fodder.  And uh, we'll just do that through the winter to help with their energy needs to, to keep  on producing milk.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:39:11):**  So with, with a, with a grass based operation, of course, you want to try to get as much  milk out of the grazing season as possible.  But of course you're, you're wanting to sell, if you're a direct to consumer farm and wanting  
**[0:39:26-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:39:26):**  to sell milk to the public through the winter, um, you also need to have a plan to, to have  milk available.  You know, one way is to try to freeze all the milk from the summer and store it, you  
**[0:39:42-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:39:42):**  know, through the winter and, and sell frozen milk, you know, then you have to have a bigger  freezer storage costs and all that, or then, uh, you can keep milk through the winter as  well.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:39:56):**  So we typically will, we'll calve in the spring and fall.  We'll do kind of a bi-seasonal breeding and, uh, the, the, the spring cows are typically  about two thirds of the herd and then the fall cows are around the one third.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:40:13):**  So, uh, there's some products that don't take as much storage in the freezer that are more  condensed, like say cheese, cheese wouldn't be in the freezer, of course, but like buttercream,  things like that, that we don't need as milk, as much milk through the winter for that.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:40:29):**  So, um, back to the winter, uh, milk production.  So the, that just on hay and your grasses are dormant, of course, out in the pastures,  you want to make milk out of it.  
**[0:40:45-0:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:40:45):**  And so we can make pretty good hay here with, with, uh, with our weather, you know, not,  not as wet climate as some areas are in the country, but, um, the, uh, the hay is a good  quality for the winter, but it's just, you know, that, that, uh, green part of the, uh,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:41:05):**  growing season, you know, it's dried into, into a dried feed and then to add, uh, this  fodder that I mentioned really boosts that need to get, to get the energy, the protein  they need to produce through the winter.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:41:23):**  And so what I'll explain that a little bit, the fodder is, is just simply a seed that  sprouted for eight days, nothing but water and, uh, roots and all get fed to the cows.  And, uh, so it's like your sprouts on your, uh, your alfalfa sprouts, your wheat sprouts,  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:41:46):**  you know, whatever your, your,  When you go to the smoothie store, you see those little weed shots.  That's what it looks like.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:41:53):**  You know, and they, and they, they always talk about the nutritional effects, you know,  when they put that in your shake and this exactly the same thing we're doing is, is  getting that concentrated nutrient in with the hay.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:42:07):**  And, uh, there's, there's a lot of water that's in, I mean, it's really wet, but as, as that  water has gone through and soaked up into that, uh, sprouted seed, that water also will  then soak into the hay and the hay becomes a, uh, a new product as well.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:42:30):**  And so it's, it's worked really good for us, uh, over the years.  And this is a great place to work through the winter.  Uh, it's nice and warm in the room that we grow it in and, and, uh, it's green and, uh,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:42:44):**  the snow can be blowing outside and, and you're feeding your cows inside.  So that's, that's what I like about it.  And the big bonus is it does produce heat as it grows.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:42:55):**  And I think I told Brian that when I was there, uh, the, the sprouts as they grow produce  heat.  Oh really?  
**[0:43:05-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:05):**  Yeah.  And, uh, so it takes very little heat to keep it in the room.  So this room, this room that Lloyd's doing this in, like the racks are what, seven, six,  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:15):**  seven feet tall Lloyd?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:18):**  Roughly seven feet tall.  And it's kind of building that's it's almost like a little trailer, right?  Like a little, no, it's like the size of a two car garage.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:25):**  It's kind of square, but it's, it's a little taller.  It's probably a 14 foot ceiling.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:30):**  Yeah.  I could, I could go taller with the trays if I wanted to ever, but it's just basically  an uninsulated cinder block building and the grain sprouting and a, and a little oil heater.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:42):**  It's all it takes.  Yeah.  Do you have any issues with mold at all?  
**[0:43:46-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:46):**  Yeah.  The other thing to, to always be in, uh, on the lookout for is, is keeping airflow, you  know, all winter long.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:43:56):**  I do have a window crack to keep airflow and, and the system I bought came with dehumidifiers  to take down some of the, because it produces a lot of, uh, moisture, but temperature and  moisture create, uh, mo you know, that the level of humidity.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:44:17):**  So the lower, the lower the temperature, the less your perspiration is, is occurring.  And so getting it too warm in there will really escalate the, the, uh, probability for mold.  So I like to keep it under 70, but you go down to six or below, then you'll have very  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:44:42):**  slow growth of yield.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:44:45):**  Yeah.  That's, that's, that's, that's, that's the thing to, to, to, to be careful for is, is,  is mold because you're not, you're not dealing with soil.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:44:56):**  You're just simply dealing with, uh, with the, with the seed and, and clean seed is  very important as well.  Uh, cause anything that, you know, when a seed dies and grows, it, it, it rots.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:45:10):**  And so that's anything that you don't have to have in there, uh, that's not growing.  You don't want in there.  So I, I have it cleaned every, every year.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:45:19):**  And, and, uh, there's, there's another place for the, for the hog is to, for all the screenings  that come out of that.  The hogs get that.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:45:31):**  So what, what's a day in the life of one of your cows like?  A day?  Yeah.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:45:40):**  Where do they start their day?  And what do they do all day?  When do they, when do they come in and milk and where do they sleep?  
**[0:45:46-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:45:46):**  Well, so, uh, for, for this time of the year, you know, they'll, they'll be, um, they'll  be not every morning, but there'll be up.  So, so my, my pastures, there's lanes going out to all my pastures from the central location,  
**[0:46:05-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:46:05):**  which is the dairy barn.  And, uh, they, um, they will often be up ready to milk, you know, they're, they're a animal  of, uh, repetition and, and, uh, and they do, uh, they, they're usually up ready to  
**[0:46:25-0:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:46:25):**  be milked.  And, and after that, you know, depending on the, on the condition of the pasture, so trying  to, you know, our, our, uh, goal is for a dairy cow to have a balanced feed, which pastures  
**[0:46:43-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:46:43):**  can, can fluctuate quite a bit throughout the year and still trying to keep it as much  dairy quality as possible.  So you get, you get too, uh, young growth out there or too, too many legumes that are

And so if, if that's the case right now, we're, we're getting into the, you know, kind of  the, the more mature stage of growth.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:47:13):**  You know, we, we came from the spring of, of young growth and then moved into, but as  from spring on, uh, we did feed a little bit of grass hay that we would have harvest, you  know, hay from, from the year before.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:47:28):**  So we're, we'd be feeding some of that right after they're done milking and, uh, and then  they're able to, to go out to their pasture and, uh, graze their, their area that we have  preselected with, with, uh, strip grazing with a poly wire.  
**[0:47:48-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:47:48):**  And, uh, we give them the amount they need for the day and that's where they, they spend  their day up in, you know, overnight and they're back the next morning.  So very, very casual, no, uh, chasing back and forth, you know, in the evenings they  
**[0:48:06-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:48:06):**  can, they can, they can be out there and, and, uh, do their thing.  I was, I was kind of looking for an opening to talk about, uh, I think, I think you call  it a tie down barn, the one with the concrete floor.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:48:22):**  Free stall.  And that's where they come in generally in bed down in the winter.  And you've put, you figured out instead of just having a bare concrete floor, wash it  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:48:33):**  out every couple of days.  Hey, we can put wood chips in there, soak up all this stuff.  Then we can take the wood chips and put them on our compost pile to move them out to the  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:48:40):**  pasture later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:43-0:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:48:43):**  And that's, that's the discussion on, uh, carbon because, um, typically in a conventional  dairy, I mean, this is, this was my understanding of carbon when I grew up was, or when I was  a child, I had the understanding that, you know, all, all, uh, wood, uh, straw that's  
**[0:49:08-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:49:08):**  waste product where either burn it or haul it away.  I mean, it's, you know, who wants that stuff?  And, uh, but we never really realize how much of the smell that comes off of the manure  
**[0:49:23-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:49:23):**  piles we create from a freestyle barn.  Maybe the, just maybe that, uh, it could use some carbon to, to stabilize all the nutrients.  And when I, when I under started understanding that, you know, and especially learning that  
**[0:49:40-0:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:49:40):**  through a lot of the farm meetings, especially in the regenerative ag side, I soon realized  that, hey, uh, we don't, we can, we can add value by some of the waste products we thought  we had mixing that in with our manure.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:49:58):**  And suddenly we have a better product than what we had is making both products better  by mixing them together.  And why not, why not have the cows mix it together instead of, uh, having, having to  
**[0:50:15-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:50:15):**  do it with your front end loader with sloppy, you know, liquid manure.  And so, um, I, the, the freestyle barn, I didn't bring up because that's typically what  conventional dairy farmers will talk about.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:50:29):**  So, uh, I'm glad you brought that up, Brian, because they usually use sand too, right?  That's right.  And that's what I used to use, you know, you'd buy sand, uh, and that was your, your costs  
**[0:50:42-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:50:42):**  for bedding, but you know, sand doesn't have a lot of carbon in it as we know.  And so I have in the last few years, I've switched from sand to, to straw.  Uh, my neighbor, my neighbor has a, has a big wheat field and, uh, I'll buy wheat straw  
**[0:51:03-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:51:03):**  from him.  And uh, so I was, I would, would put straw in the freestalls.  And when I, when I say freestalls, that's where they, they bed down.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:51:12):**  If they want to lay down, there's like bars every four foot and they can lay there that  way they're not like in the manure area.  And so that area I would always keep bedding on, but the area where they would stand and  
**[0:51:28-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:51:28):**  you know, they'd get some hay, uh, that area was just, you know, it would get liquidy and,  and, uh, just like typical freestall manure is, it's more of a slurry than it is a, uh,  a solid.  
**[0:51:43-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:51:43):**  And so I'd be there trying to scoop this up, haul it out and you can't put it on a pile,  of course.  You know, I had a, uh, a, uh, blueprint drawn up at one time to put in a manure pit, but  
**[0:52:01-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:52:01):**  you know, that's keeping a slurry manure in an open, uh, pit is just, you get, you get  smells your neighbors really don't care to have.  Well, it's dangerous.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:52:15):**  I've heard of people dying cause they fall into those things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:52:20):**  It's a different, it's a different biological breakdown process that happens when it's a  manure slurry versus manure incorporated with wood and straw.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:52:36):**  Yeah.  I want to talk about that too, just because I had soil samples from about 10 different  dairies, 40% of those dairies, they put their green manure, spread it right onto their pastures.  
**[0:52:50-0:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:52:50):**  And they found out that the carbon actually, they lost carbon accrual.  Really And so I just thought that was a fun fact.  And I mean, it kind of makes sense though, if it's hot, if it's hot manure, it's going  
**[0:53:03-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:03):**  to sterilize the microbiology and everything else.  And it's not really, you're not, you're not managing with nature.  Right.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:12):**  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:15):**  I mean, I know that some of them have become better with it, with applying it on top of  like a cover crop or something instead of, I mean, back in the day, we'd put it on bare  dirt and that, you know, how much did we gain?  
**[0:53:30-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:30):**  Who knows by taking that out there.  I mean, with the open, you know, the volatizing, the micro-  Of course it won't blow away or wash away.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:43):**  What is the thought process you think?  They just want it to compost for a while before it's too much ammonia or too much nitrates  on the soil.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:53:55):**  Well, can I say government regulation?  I think that a big part of it is you have to keep your manure out of the streams as  a dairy farmer.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:54:08):**  Okay.  So you can't haul manure when it's raining is the other problem.  So what do you do with it when it's raining and all your cows are in the freestall and  
**[0:54:18-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:54:18):**  you've got tons and tons of manure coming off of that every day.  So you have to have storage for that in order for it to not be in our streams.  And so that's the NRCS thing of trying to keep it in a contained structure so that when  
**[0:54:36-0:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:54:36):**  you can get out in the field that you have the capacity to do that.  And so it's not really about the composting process more it's about the storing process  until you can get out there.  
**[0:54:49-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:54:49):**  And so yeah, that just adds, you know, when you have that manure sitting there and you  open that crust on top and start hauling that and that's been sitting there.  I mean that's anaerobic medium and yeah, you really have, yeah, neighbors are not happy  
**[0:55:11-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:55:11):**  when you do that.  I had a permit and luckily it got prolonged and prolonged, you know, for cost sharing  for one of those.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:55:27):**  And you know, that's one of the best things that ever happened was not getting that done  because I mean, I actually helped build one for my uncle and yeah, just the way of hauling  it.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:55:43):**  I mean, it's hard on machinery, you know, it coats every bearing and sprocket piece  of equipment with it.  You got to wash it down.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:55:53):**  And yeah, to be here with the composting thing and actually add value to it.  But you know, the problem is you can't do it on a, you know, 1000 cal dairy.  You've got where you get all the carbon, you got to have that all hauled in where you're  
**[0:56:09-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:56:09):**  going to get it and hauling becomes a big factor and you know, and then hauling it out.  And I still think it would be worth it even for bigger farms.  It's just that, you know, they don't have time.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:56:22):**  It takes time to get your carbon to the farm and then having a place to pile your compost  and all that.  So I think it's more of a timeframe and just I don't want to do it than it is it making  
**[0:56:39-0:56:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:56:39):**  sense to them.  So yeah.  Yeah, it's, you know, I think we're, a lot of us are really challenging that paradigm  
**[0:56:50-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:56:50):**  of get bigger, get out, you know, you have to get big, you have to mechanize, you know,  you have to do this, you have to do that.  And you know, there's a value in staying small.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:57:00):**  There's a value in, in, in just trying to support your own community.  So let's talk about your store and how that's important to support your local community  and local food culture.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:57:12):**  Sure, sure.  Well, that's what I really like to talk about because that's, that's where, you know, when  I realized the connection that a farm has to the consumer is through our buying structure  
**[0:57:27-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:57:27):**  we have.  And, you know, I had grown up with the idea that, you know, the farmer was the low dog  and he just takes the price he can get and be happy with it.  
**[0:57:44-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:57:44):**  And, you know, everybody's, everybody can charge the farmer what he wants, but the farmer  can never charge the market or the co-op, whoever he's selling to what he wants.  And I realized all that is, is just a mindset thing that us as farmers have.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:58:07):**  We've lost the control of, of, of our, where our food goes and changing the way we think  about it really helps to take some of that control back because the consumers are the  people who are, who are getting the products we produce in the end anyway, why not make  
**[0:58:31-0:58:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:58:31):**  a relationship or connection with them instead of trying to keep on making a connection with,  with your co-op or, or whoever.  And I realized that it's a, it's a lot of steps you have to, or a lot of positions you  
**[0:58:46-0:59:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:58:46):**  have to have as a farmer to do that.  And it, that, that's probably one of the more challenging parts of the way we do it, but  the most fulfilling thing for me is to be able to supply food for people who, who really  
**[0:59:02-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:59:02):**  need clean, pure food and don't, and, and, and, and, and they know that they can't keep  going on the health journey they were, they need to change.  And we as farmers need to, need to be able to understand that, that what, what they're  
**[0:59:22-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:59:22):**  wanting, what they're telling us is, is pretty important because they're the ones that are,  that are carrying the dollar and giving and paying, paying the price they need to pay  for their own health.  
**[0:59:38-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=0:59:38):**  And so that's, I think one of the biggest things I love to see here is just the people  coming in and the appreciation they have for what we've done and, and produced for them  and just see, see how, how, how they go and tell someone else and how, how they'll have  
**[1:00:00-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:00):**  a success story of, of, you know, a different, a different health, you know, a different  health outcome than what they had.  And to be a, to be a farmer and, and, and hear that, that's, that's pretty humbling.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:14):**  So yeah.  Well, I'm going to, I'm going to brag on, on your cows and on your operation, cause  I put probably at least a pint of cream, real heavy cream from y'all's dairy in my coffee  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:32):**  every week.  What do you sell that point for?  It's like eight 50 a pint.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:37):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have no problem paying that and putting that in my coffee.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:41):**  It is, it's amazing.  We buy your milk, you walk into the store and Lloyd showed me like the cheese cooler  and there's just this giant wall of cheese.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:00:54):**  They make fresh cheese curds on the farm, several kinds.  The jalapeno cheddar are my favorite.  They make mozzarella on the farm.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:01:04):**  That's just perfect.  I can't wait to find a pizza to put some on.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:01:11):**  So besides your dairy products and your chicken eggs, what, what, how, I guess what I'm getting  at is what other farms are using your storefront to help market their products?  Yeah.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:01:29):**  So we, we, we have realized that, like I said earlier, that we can't do it all, even though  we'd like to sometimes.  We can't do it all and we, we need to continue allowing other people to be involved in, in  
**[1:01:45-1:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:01:45):**  the operation or in the movement, I should say.  I think one of the things that I learned was diversity of, of, you know, crops, enterprises,  you know, pastures, you know, having diversity and pack that's, that's all good.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:02:04):**  But realizing that to continue this, the regenerative movement, there has to be more people involved.  And there's, there's a lot more, there's a lot more things that, that, that go on in  the dairy or on the farm that need to be done when you're direct marketing.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:02:24):**  And so one of the things that we, we have done is, is allowing other people to supply  products in the way that we would like to do if we would be doing it.  And so, and so we have, we have several, several other farms that contribute as well.  
**[1:02:43-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:02:43):**  So one would be a produce farm, which grows vegetables and hoop houses and, and throughout  the year does a lot of microgreens.  And then they also, because of a smaller acreage, their operation works well for broiler chicken.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:04):**  So they do our broiler chickens.  So they're using our storefront.  And then we have a mushroom farm that grows a lot of mushrooms.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:14):**  And that was probably the most exciting bender we, for me that we had to have mushrooms available.  So I love them.  What kind of mushrooms?  
**[1:03:26-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:26):**  You doing morels?  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:29):**  Yeah.  I've tried to go hunt mushrooms and there's such a big secret about morels that you never,  I'm never able to.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:38):**  Like it's a cult following.  Like they'll kill you if they find that they will not share their location.  Suspension all the time.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:45):**  Yeah.  So, so they, they've become innovative too and made, you know, they do dried mushrooms  and, and, uh, I think they're coming out with a mushroom jerky here pretty soon.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:03:57):**  So we did taste some of that and I was very hooked on that.  So hopefully we'll be able to get that in soon.  And then we have a baker who does sourdough bread baking, different types of bread.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:04:15):**  And then we have, my mom does, does a lot of baking as well.  The more the snacky items, the cakes and cookies and, and, uh, she'll do homemade candy through  the winter.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:04:32):**  That's been a hot item for her all her life.  That's kind of been her big business.  And then she does a lot of, uh, canning, uh, vegetables.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:04:42):**  And so, uh, see who else?  Oh, we got someone doing some, uh, fermentation.  We've got sauerkraut there.  
**[1:04:51-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:04:51):**  So, uh, that was one thing I really liked and hope hopefully we'll be able to have more  fermented products, um, down the road.  So, um, I took home some of that sourdough bread.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:06):**  You're just talking about some cheese and some butter.  Oh my goodness.  I got to tell you that was the best grilled cheese sandwich I have had in my life.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:16):**  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  We, uh, we definitely take for granted what all is at our fingertips.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:26):**  We send the kids out to go shopping and, and you know, who knows what they come in with.  So it's great.  Yeah.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:35):**  Sourdough bread, Bortrager raw dairy butter, your cheese will beat the heck out of rainbow  iron kids bread with margarine fried in margarine with Kraft singles on them any day.  Y'all can keep that stuff.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:48):**  I don't want it anymore.  When were those things ever good?  Yeah.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:05:52):**  I've just been amazed how, you know, probably the big thing that I hear over and over is  it doesn't take as much food, you know, when, when, uh, when they're eating more of the  stuff that has, yeah.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:10):**  It is a little more expensive.  I mean, we gotta, we gotta be upfront about that.  It's a little more expensive to buy.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:16):**  Yeah.  But can I eat so much?  Yes.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:20):**  Okay.  Yes.  It is more expensive, but if you look at what you're spending your money on, I am sure you  
**[1:06:27-1:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:27):**  can make room for it in your budget.  And you know, Mike Calacrate has the argument that, yeah, you can go buy that cheap food.  That's cheap.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:36):**  And you're going to end up paying a lot of health costs later down the line.  But if you do business with somebody that doesn't externalize their costs.  Yeah.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:46):**  You know, you'll save money in the long run, even by eating, you know, even by paying a  little bit more for food, you'll save that way down the line on healthcare and, and reduce  stress and longevity and, and other things later.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:06:59):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:07:02):**  So, um, kind of hear about the midpoint.  Let's uh, where, how can people find you?  How can, how do your customers find you?  
**[1:07:14-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:07:14):**  Well, word of mouth of course has been really big, but my, uh, my wife Arlene, she does  a lot of marketing and, uh, she'll, uh, she'll find a lot of people through email marketing,  you know, through getting people's emails.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:07:32):**  And uh, you know, one of, one of the, uh, another big thing that where people find us  is we've done tours, uh, and just having people come out and, uh, looking at, uh, looking  at the farm, showing them around and, and, you know, we, we never are, we, we underestimate  
**[1:07:54-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:07:54):**  the power of connection when people see where their food is from.  I mean, it's very normal for us.  It's just like, okay, yeah, this is what we do every day, but to actually have someone  
**[1:08:05-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:08:05):**  experience that it's a completely different ball game.  But, um, yeah, our website definitely, uh, gets quite a bit of traffic, um, born trigger  dairy.com and, uh, and then more on the tourist side of things.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:08:26):**  Uh, we, we are signed up through harvest hosts and that brings quite a few people along from  places that would normally not show up here.  And what that is, it's a, uh, a, uh, RV parking system where they can park here for the night  
**[1:08:46-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:08:46):**  and, uh, they're, they can park here free.  They're just obligated to make a purchase at our business.  And so, uh, it's, it's, it's really rewarding to see, you know, they can't believe something  
**[1:09:03-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:03):**  like this exists, you know, you know, they, most of them come from the city and, uh, they're,  they're out traveling, seeing the country and, and just, yeah, just odd that they can  stay on a farm and not just a tourist farm, but a place where food gets grown.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:19):**  You know, I almost wish I could be there.  When you had like an RV full of people from New York city or Chicago come through and  stop and walk into your store for the first time or the first time they taste any of your  
**[1:09:33-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:33):**  food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:36):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:39):**  To ice cream has become a pretty, a pretty, uh, a raving thing amongst them.  You know, they'll, they'll post a review about the ice cream and they're like, we need to  get your ice cream.  
**[1:09:51-1:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:09:51):**  You know, one of the first words they, they tell me when they stepped out of their RV  and, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a lot of fun meeting them and, and, uh, yeah, we  had one, I think one that really made an impression on me was, you know, they, they were parked  
**[1:10:10-1:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:10):**  out by the, uh, they could, they could look over the pastures and, uh, they were sitting  in the RV and said, I was drinking, drinking my milk and I could look out there and see  the cows producing the milk I'm drinking.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:23):**  He said, that was pretty, pretty awesome.  Yeah.  You can't buy that kind of connection with the customer.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:32):**  Right.  That's right.  That's amazing.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:35):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:38):**  So we've got a, I've got a question here that comes out of our Facebook group, ranching  reboot paddock.  All of you listeners listening out there come to Facebook and search for ranching reboot  
**[1:10:45-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:45):**  paddock.  Um, so Dan Hesselup, if I mispronounced that, you can yell at me later.  He wants to know what are some regenerative practices that a conventional operation could  
**[1:10:55-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:10:55):**  begin to implement cover crops, grazing based heifer raising things like that.  Yeah, I think that would be a good, a good, a good start is, is to, to when you're, when  you're wanting to go to grazing, I think the first, the first group of, uh, animals to  
**[1:11:15-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:11:15):**  use would be your, your dry cows.  Like the, the cows that are not milking there's, there's, there's some more forgiveness there.  And uh, and just try it with them before you get into your, your, your higher producing  
**[1:11:33-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:11:33):**  and you know, heifers of course would be, would be the next thing, you know, the calves.  Uh, but, but just, yeah, just, just start, uh, playing around with it.  I wouldn't do it on a big, big scale.  
**[1:11:48-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:11:48):**  Uh, keep, keep, uh, keep your risk low because I know the first time I, I turned cows out  for grazing.  Um, well, it was what you do back in the day.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:12:02):**  You'd have your wheat, your wheat, uh, in the spring and, uh, turn the cows out, you  know, through the winter, late winter, you turn the cows out and, and you'd have the,  the milk, you'd have a flavor in the milk because of the strong flavor it creates.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:12:20):**  And uh, so yeah, that, you know, the cows didn't know what to do going out there the  first time they just started running, running in circles.  They didn't know what to do.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:12:29):**  They were, they didn't know they were supposed to eat.  This doesn't look like a barn.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:12:34):**  Yeah.  And so I think that's, that's a good thing, uh, to start with and the dairy side or the  dairy cow part of the milking cows, um, you'll have to have lanes to get, you know, from  
**[1:12:49-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:12:49):**  your milking barn to the pasture.  So uh, there, there is, you know, an added step in, in grazing, in grazing dairy cattle  is keeping lanes and, and, you know, keeping the traffic line open so they can get through  
**[1:13:07-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:13:07):**  because you don't want them to be walking over all your pastures all the time and back  to your dairy barn, uh, lanes seem to seem to work the best.  So if you, if you don't have to have them come back and forth like a, like a heifer  
**[1:13:24-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:13:24):**  of the calves, I think that would be a good, good place to start.  I mean, I, you know, and I think we can both agree that when you're doing like a high density  operation, you're going to have a lane somewhere, you know, when you're doing daily moves, whether  
**[1:13:36-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:13:36):**  it's a lane back to water or lane back to the milking barn.  And that just may be kind of an unavoidable part, part of the deal.  And maybe, you know, we have to, we have to adapt to that by every couple of years, moving  
**[1:13:48-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:13:48):**  that lane and given that, given that area of time to rest.  That leads into another good question that, uh, that more than one asked them in the Facebook  group, which was, uh, about lanes versus mobile parlors.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:14:02):**  Like how important is the layout, is laying out your facility and planning your facility?  How important is that, um, for long-term success and, and are mobile parlors maybe, maybe a  situation that works for some people?  
**[1:14:19-1:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:14:19):**  Yeah, I, I, uh, I think there's a possibility there for, for mobile parlors.  Uh, I guess I got lucky, uh, with, with our layout here that we're, our, our farmstead  is in the center, uh, north and south of our farm land.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:14:42):**  And so that really helps a lot.  Now if you're on a corner of a big acreage, yeah, then you're, then you're, your cows  will have to walk further.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:14:52):**  So the more centralized your milking parlor, the better, just simply because of cow distance  walking and not just the cows, but to keep those lanes up.  I mean, your costs of keeping lanes going is a lot higher the further they have to walk.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:15:11):**  But, um, yeah, I think the probably context makes a big part of that just simply because  there's a lot of dairy barns empty.  And, uh, if, if you're, if you'd be starting on completely bare land and trying to start  
**[1:15:33-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:15:33):**  up a dairy farm, I think a portable parlor would be something to consider.  I know there's a lot of, of, uh, things that go into that, that most people don't think  about is, you know, you're getting your, your, if you have a pipeline system to keep your,  
**[1:15:52-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:15:52):**  your, you know, for all your washing and everything, you have to keep all the lines drainable.  So if you're not level, uh, you might have some problems.  And so that's one thing.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:16:06):**  And just the, just the portability of, of, uh, of the system, you know, it would take  some engineering and all that to make it work, which I know I have really took some interest  in it, uh, to, to, to, to research some of the, uh, the difference between lane maintenance  
**[1:16:35-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:16:35):**  and portable barn, uh, movement and all that.  Um, so I think that context is, is probably a big thing.  If there's a dairy, a dairy, old dairy barn on it, and there's some concrete around the  
**[1:16:52-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:16:52):**  dairy barn and the, and the dairy barn is centrally located, I would use that.  But if there's, if it's bare land or the dairy, the dairy barn is falling down and, and it's  not, not worth reusing.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:17:06):**  Yeah.  Then I, then I'd reconsider that.  But if you'd be just strictly looking for some land for, for a dairy farm, um, I, the,  
**[1:17:17-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:17:17):**  the, the more square the layout, the better, just because you can, you can kind of have  more of that pie shaped thing than, uh, you would with, uh, with a long strip or several  odd corners or something like that.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:17:35):**  Uh, because it does just like our operation, our herd size does, uh, is determined by our  land layout.  So you go portable and you would have some more options, but probably more variables  
**[1:17:53-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:17:53):**  as well.  I haven't seen a whole lot here in the country as far as researching.  I know there's, there's quite a few in New Zealand doing it and over in Europe, I've  
**[1:18:08-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:18:08):**  seen some and they're, they're pretty cool the way they've got them set up.  Uh, I've seen one where, where the cows come up, uh, and they, uh, they go into their stall  and uh, this is right on the line of the next paddock and they're, they're ready to go to  
**[1:18:28-1:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:18:28):**  their next paddock and they know after they get milk, they'll, they'll go to their next  paddock and soon as they're done milking, the gate opens in front of them and they get  to go to their new feed.  
**[1:18:39-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:18:39):**  And so that, I think that's pretty cool the way they do it.  And you know, it's what makes sense for your operation and for your goals.  There's, there's a lot of different ways to do it and do it well.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:18:54):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I guess we're still leaving.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:19:02):**  Wow.  Just looking at the time.  It's a time is flying by and I don't want to keep you here all day, but man, we still  
**[1:19:10-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:19:10):**  have so many questions.  Um, so I'll edit out the stupid awkward pause later.  Lloyd, we have so many, you know, I have so many more questions and you know, so many  
**[1:19:31-1:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:19:31):**  more things I want to get to.  We might just have to have you back for another episode later.  Before we kind of close out, let's talk about like some specifics about milk.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:19:41):**  What uh, like what is, what, how does your milk break down component wise?  Like a protein fat ratios?  Yeah.  
**[1:19:50-1:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:19:50):**  Yeah.  Well, uh, we're, we're, uh, around like a 4%, uh, fat and a three and a half, three,  three and a half percent protein.  
**[1:20:03-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:20:03):**  And uh, that, that is, I mean, there's, there's the, the cows are, uh, I mean, they're not  like a high producing cream, uh, like, you know, Jersey or, or, uh, Guernsey.  But they, they, they work really well for cheese making.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:20:25):**  So that's, that's kind of the, the, uh, the main processing of our operation is the cheese.  Like you said, the wall of cheese is, that's the reason why.  So guys, his face when he showed me the wall of cheese, it just lit up and he says, this  
**[1:20:43-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:20:43):**  is all the cheese.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:47-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:20:47):**  So, so they just, so they have a better, better, uh, a better milk ratio component ratio for,  for the products that you like to sell.  And I can understand why you like to do a lot of cheese because it stores and it stores  
**[1:21:02-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:02):**  well and it holds it and it doesn't depreciate.  The product doesn't depreciate in storage.  Yep.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:09):**  And if you make your cheese right, sometimes the value appreciates.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, the one thing that gets better with age.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:18):**  So when they say like, you know, cheeses age seven years and they're bragging about it,  does that mean there was a while where they just made more cheese than they could sell  and they stored it up and then they were like, oh, hey, it's special because we've had it  
**[1:21:28-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:28):**  for seven years.  Yeah.  Well, cheese making is an art.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:32):**  And so, um, I'm fascinated how, how mistakes become new varieties.  And it's, it's interesting for me to listen to other people talk about, you know, oh,  they, they did this or did that.  
**[1:21:49-1:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:21:49):**  And oh, we'll just call a different kind now because it's a different variation of what  they had in mind to do.  And so you get these, yeah, different names and, and, uh, varieties going out and like,  
**[1:22:01-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:22:01):**  how did you come up with that?  Like, well, it wasn't that hard.  What if you gave some cheese to your mushroom farmer to put in his mushroom room to age  
**[1:22:11-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:22:11):**  while the mushrooms are growing?  Yeah, I haven't been into the, the whole, uh, bacterial aging part of it.  Um, so that's, that's a whole new level of, um, of aging.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:22:27):**  The furthest I've came is our bandaged cheddar, which is a cheddar cheese that has aged longer  than traditional cheddar.  But instead of, of wrapping it in plastic, like most of all the other cheeses do, it  
**[1:22:43-1:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:22:43):**  actually gets wrapped in pork lard.  And that creates, uh, also creates an air tight seal, but not just that.  Yes.  
**[1:22:57-1:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:22:57):**  It also creates a unique flavor as it ages.  I'm looking at my watch and doing the math on how long it would take me to drive to Yoder.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:08-1:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:08):**  I'm kind of a little mad because you didn't tell me about this when I was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:15):**  Well, time was of the essence.  I have that written down.  That's definitely going to be at our next order.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:24):**  Yeah.  Bandaged cheddar.  That sounds amazing.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:27):**  And I want to have some right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:30-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:30):**  The other cheese I'm trying to keep improving is our Kefir cheese.  Right now it's just wrapped in plastic, but Kefir has so many different bacterial and  microbial components in it that, I mean, I've got a cheese book that a guy, he's able to  
**[1:23:56-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:23:56):**  make all these different kinds of cheese just with this kefir, like these kefir grains that  are put in milk and then the milk becomes kefir and that's what he uses for culture.  That's what our kefir cheese is used in our kefir cheese.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:24:14):**  And so that in itself is really fascinating to me because I love biology and the bacterial  components.  I've played around with that, so I'd love to do a, well, I shouldn't say I'd love to,  
**[1:24:32-1:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:24:32):**  I actually have, so I guess it's coming out here.  I've tried the kefir cheese with the lard bandaging, so my excitement is building to  open up that once it's aged for a little longer yet.  
**[1:24:48-1:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:24:48):**  Well, if you need taste testers, you know where to come.  Yeah.  Yeah, CK, you can get there almost as quick as I can.  
**[1:24:59-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:24:59):**  Yeah.  Some of my test tasting is some becomes pretty strong and you're like, is that well aged  or is that just kind of molded or something?  
**[1:25:11-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:25:11):**  Yeah.  So to get the difference between what a real strong aging is and just, yeah, a sour cheese  is.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:25:22):**  I imagine that's a pretty fine line.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  And if you have so much cheese, you're like, okay, what's good anymore?  
**[1:25:30-1:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:25:30):**  I mean, what's a good taste?  Eating all the scraps all the time, I'm kind of like, okay, what do you set to do?  Oh, wow.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:25:43):**  Well, Lloyd, it's been a blast and we don't want to take up any more of your time than  we have to.  Have you left anything on the table that you want to talk about?  
**[1:25:54-1:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:25:54):**  Well, I know I just like to leave you with the value of building that connection from  the food to your food, whether the value of the consumer making the connection to the  food or the farmer making the connection to the consumer who eats the food.  
**[1:26:16-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:26:16):**  I think that's what I want to leave you with because that's what changed our operation  from being just a farm struggling along trying to make it work to something that's actually  we feel good about.  
**[1:26:32-1:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:26:32):**  We're all about it.  Shaking the hand that feeds you.  Absolutely.  
**[1:26:35-1:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:26:35):**  Yep.  Yep.  So is there anything you'd like to ask us?  
**[1:26:40-1:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:26:40):**  Any hard questions you really want me to answer on the air?  Well, is there any, yeah, probably back to the carbon, how much is a ton of carbon worth  to you, whether it be wood chips or straw or something like that?  
**[1:27:09-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:27:09):**  I think that's a good question.  $50 a ton.  That's the price on the European market for sequestration is 50 bucks a ton.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:27:20):**  I think it's going to be higher.  I just think the way the environment, social and governance, ESG is the hot topic now for  plans for companies.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:27:32):**  It's going to happen.  Where are they going to apply that calculation?  If the carbon calculation doesn't go all the way back to the wellhead, it's fraudulent.  
**[1:27:48-1:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:27:48):**  Because it's got to go back to the wellhead and they've got to account for that.  And then every user down the line has to account for that.  It doesn't need to be able to be audited.  
**[1:27:59-1:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:27:59):**  It 100% needs to be transparent.  It's so complicated.  I mean, these supply chains are so complicated.  
**[1:28:06-1:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:06):**  I don't think we'll ever get enough transparency to where that system can't be gamed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:13-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:13):**  Yeah.  There's a lot of hands involved with that.  Yep.  
**[1:28:18-1:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:18):**  No, but we have to do a better job of being energy efficient, producing the same with  less inputs, with more creativity, more of our ingenuity and rebuilding a bond with livestock.  That's something that's going to be coming up soon.  
**[1:28:37-1:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:37):**  And that's the motivator behind carbon is it's actually enabling you to do those things.  Innovate, actually get paid to innovate and figure out how to make a livelihood in your  community.  
**[1:28:48-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:48):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think becoming better at utilizing the waste that we deal with, having better distribution.  
**[1:28:58-1:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:28:58):**  Because it's not really waste though, right?  It's not waste.  It's energy.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:01):**  Right.  And that's what I think is the ability to utilize that in an energy needed way.  I mean, there's ways of doing that.  
**[1:29:13-1:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:13):**  We don't need to be hauling everything off and looking at it as waste, definitely.  Awesome sauce.  Lloyd, it's been an absolute pleasure to have you here with us today.  
**[1:29:31-1:29:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:31):**  Thank you for joining us.  CK, I think it's time to land this plane to get out of here.  What do you think?  
**[1:29:38-1:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:38):**  Yep, thank you.  Hey, it's been good.  Thanks for the chat and the other good episodes I've listened to.  
**[1:29:47-1:29:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:47):**  They've been really helpful.  Thank you.  It's our pleasure, Lloyd, and we're going to do our best to keep good content rolling  
**[1:29:53-1:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/19-Loyd-Borntrager--All-Grass-All-The-Time-e1334k5#t=1:29:53):**  out to everybody.  So with that, I'm Red Hills Rancher.  We're out.

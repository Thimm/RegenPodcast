We are taking a different approach to agriculture podcasting and discussing ideas outside of  mainstream ranching with some of today's most innovative and progressive producers  
**[0:00:51-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:00:51):**  of all things edible.

Hi everyone, this is Ranching Reboot with Red Hills Rancher and your favorite host,  CK.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:10):**  Today we have Mike Calacrate of Ranch Food Direct and Calacrate Cattle Co.  Hey Mike, it's good to see you.  How are you doing?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:17):**  I'm good, CK.  Beautiful day here in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  I hear you guys are getting a lot of precipitation.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:26):**  Where did you hear that?  I'm saying that to be continued.  That is not true.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:29):**  Yes, tell me more.  Well, we, you know, from St. Francis to Colorado Springs has been really a dry area and also  up in the mountains west of here it's extremely been extremely dry.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:43):**  So I think we had a little bit of snow up in the snow country, but I was just thinking,  I was just looking through the records and we could have probably produced a grass finished  animal out in St. Francis two out of the last 10 years.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:01:57):**  It's been extremely tough with the dry weather.  There's dirt blowing out there.  There's a lot of farmers out chiseling and stripping wheat fields.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:02:07):**  So you mentioned you're in Colorado Springs and that's where you're marketing R's Direct  and your production base is back in.  That's right.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:02:15):**  Okay.  Yeah, I've been, I've been raising cattle in St. Francis for 45 years and feeding cattle.  I built a couple of feedlots in St. Francis.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:02:24):**  I got out of college in 1975 from Colorado State University with an animal science degree  and went back to St. Francis and worked on my in-laws place.  And at the same time I was riding bulls, I was rodeo and I was a professional bull rider  
**[0:02:38-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:02:38):**  for several years.  And so I was rodeoing part time and working on the ranch part time, saddle on a horse  most days, you know, checking heat on cows, bringing in a lot of new technology from my  
**[0:02:52-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:02:52):**  education at CSU to the operation.  And then after a little bit, I decided the community needed a feedlot.  A lot of grain production.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:03:02):**  We're right on top of the Ogallala Aquifer and we didn't have a cattle feeding facility.  And so I decided I'd head one of those up.  I got together with 900 members of the community and we built a 14,000 head feedlot.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:03:17):**  And so I operated that for about eight years and then went over to my in-laws place and  ended up buying them out.  They were ready to retire and built a feedlot there, which is about a 12,000 head feedlot.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:03:30):**  But this was really a step up in design and the way that the feedlot was laid out.  I learned a lot on the first one and I applied that to the second one.  So at the very heart of what I've always done is been a cattle feeder.  
**[0:03:45-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:03:45):**  And so I kind of went from feeding cattle and on a commercial basis to feeding cattle  just for myself for Ranch Foods Direct.  And basically what happened is about 1988, I heard the president and CEO of IBP, Bob  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:03):**  Peterson, give a speech to the Kansas Livestock Association.  Now that's 1988.  So that was a long time ago.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:10):**  And he basically was saying that we need to make these big packers like Montford and Cargill,  make them stop feeding cattle.  They've got a real advantage over IBP who was a cash trader.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:21):**  And he said, you guys really need to help us make them stop feeding cattle.  It's in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the way they're utilizing those inventories.  And he just wanted to bring our attention to it.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:34):**  And so I got to thinking about that.  And basically, we didn't do anything.  The organizations didn't do anything.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:42):**  Kansas Livestock Association, National Cattlemen's, none of them did anything.  So it was a couple years later that Bob Peterson came back to the Kansas Livestock Association  and says, well, guys, you didn't do anything.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:04:53):**  So what we've decided to do is develop our own plan for captive supplies.  And it's called the formula.  Well, you know, I call the formula the nuclear warhead of the arsenal of captive supplies,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:05:09):**  the weapon of captive supplies.  And it was brilliant.  I mean, IBP didn't have to own any cattle, they didn't have to build any feedlots, they  
**[0:05:17-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:05:17):**  didn't have to worry about the, you know, the 30 inches of snow that's blowing straight  across the road in Dodge City, Kansas, they didn't have to worry about anything, they  got all the cattle they wanted, without investing a single penny in that without taking any  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:05:29):**  risk, because the feedlots were so desperate for for a cash bid or any kind of a market  for their cattle.  And so the formula took off.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:05:38):**  And our share of the consumer dollar as a rancher plummeted from then until today.  So that was that was what happened.  But after after the formula, and about probably the 19 shortly after the 1990 meeting at KLA,  
**[0:05:54-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:05:54):**  I just started speaking out, I started writing quite a lot.  I can't remember when I started the blog, but it was at least 20 years ago.  But I, I just wasn't willing to be in the cattle business without a competitive marketplace.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:06:10):**  Because it's a fool's game.  It's a fool's game to buy your raw material in a competitive market and sell your finished  product in a predatory market.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:06:21):**  It's just that simple, you're going to go out of business.  And that's exactly what's happened to ranchers and the cattle feeders, the farmer feeder,  which I think is is critical to a competitive market.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:06:33):**  Lots of those guys bidding on calves every year, that's all gone.  You know, we lost over 84,000 of those cattle feeding operations, and almost without anyone  saying anything.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:06:43):**  And I know it's embarrassing to go bankrupt.  Of course it is.  I mean, the Kansas Livestock Association, the NCBA, the land grant universities, they're  
**[0:06:52-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:06:52):**  all saying it's because of your bad management, you should have been managing your risk, you  know, trading the futures market, if you really want to stomachache and lose a ranch in a  hurry, that's how you get that done.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:03):**  And in addition to not having a market for your cattle.  And so I got to speaking out a lot and I got blackballed.  Finally they had enough.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:11):**  I sued IBP in 1996 as one of the plaintiffs in a class action to try to get them to stop  using captive supplies to depress price and manipulate markets.  And the big packers all just decided, you know, we've had enough of Calc rate, let's  
**[0:07:27-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:27):**  just not buy his cattle.  So here I am with my 12,000 head feedlot with 14,000 in it because I couldn't sell them.  And finally, the only buyer I had was National Beef.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:38):**  No one else would buy my cattle.  And so finally, I just asked the National Beef buyer what was up and he said, Okay,  I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I'm I've been told not to buy your cattle.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:47):**  Well, that's obvious.  You know, here I am on sitting on these overweight cattle.  And so I called Dan Glickman, who was the Secretary of Agriculture at the time and whose  
**[0:07:56-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:07:56):**  job it was to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act to stop this kind of thing from happening.  And I said to Dan, who I knew, he was from Kansas, he was you guys know him too.  He was a former legislator in Kansas.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:08):**  And and, and I said, Dan, why don't you just enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act?  And he said, Well, you know, Mike, in this day of globalization, we need big meat companies  that can do business globally.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:19):**  And so he drank the Kool Aid of globalization, you know, the whether it's the Ronald Reagan  Kool Aid or the Bush Kool Aid or the or the Clinton Kool Aid or the Obama Kool Aid or  the Trump Kool Aid.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:31):**  I mean, it's all the same flavor.  It's all the same thing.  It's about global corporations having all the power they want to do business globally.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:39):**  And it's this mentality tastes the same.  Yeah.  And it's this false mentality of trickle down economics, you know, that exports are going  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:46):**  to save us.  And, you know, if Packers do well, producers will do well, and it's just wrong.  So anyway, yeah, I was in the lawsuit, I got blackballed.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:08:55):**  I called like when I did call Glickman.  He said, I'll tell you what, though, Micah, I'll have I'll have I'll make a few phone  calls.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:09:02):**  And so he called ConAgra up in Greeley, formerly Montford, and now JBS.  And he said, buy all of Calacrates cattle, he basically forced him to buy my cattle.  And I went empty.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:09:12):**  I just got rid of every single one.  I've got a picture of this beautiful, well designed, wonderful facility that was serving  our community well.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:09:22):**  And it's Yeah, it's totally abandoned.  And 15 people went to town without a job.  And so I just decided about a year later, I said, this is a bunch of crap.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:09:30):**  I mean, we can, you know, you think about the three legs of the school, the stool litigation,  which I was very aggressive with legislation, which, you know, you can work on, but with  little success, because of the ownership of Congress by Wall Street and big corporations,  
**[0:09:47-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:09:47):**  and the mentality of the Ronald Reagan deregulation kind of thinking, which started with him.  But wait, what about the solution?  Would it would that be fun to build a new pathway, a safe pathway to the consumer without  
**[0:10:01-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:01):**  the predator?  Yeah, without the big meat packers, putting you out of business without the big without  having to get out of bed every day, and looking at the cattle futures market to see how you're  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:11):**  supposed to feel?  Wouldn't that be cool?  Yeah.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:14):**  So that's what we did.  We started a community.  Yeah, but I gotta tell you, the only way you can start Ranch Foods Direct is because you  
**[0:10:21-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:21):**  have another business that makes money.  The Calgary bander.  That's where that came in as this godsend of a business that let me eat while I still  
**[0:10:31-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:31):**  was investing and taking a lot of risk and building this alternative pathway to the consumer,  which is called Ranch Foods Direct.  And so that evolved over the years.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:40):**  I mean, we started out in killing our cattle in Colorado Springs, GNC packing company.  And then when they were going to go out of business, we we got into the mobile slaughter  stuff and started using a mobile slaughter unit at St. Francis and we built a break plant  
**[0:10:55-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:10:55):**  in Colorado Springs to where now we had everything under control from from the raisin of the  animal to the to the slaughter feeding and the slaughter and also being able to cut it  up and sell it in the wholesale and retail markets.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:11:08):**  So we had our pathway built and now it's just a matter of operating it efficiently and well.  And that's where we are today.  And in fact, the mobile unit just got pulled out of the building here last couple of weeks  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:11:20):**  ago.  Really?  We've now got a standalone purpose built slaughter facility in St. Francis.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:11:28):**  Now that we know it works, we can sell the mobile slaughter unit.  It's going to Montana, Montana Farmers Union and Farmers Union Enterprises bought it and  they're going to make it part of a teaching curriculum at Northern Montana College, which

And so we're going to start teaching, cutting and and butchering and all of that to students  up there.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:11:52):**  And I'm really excited about bringing those interns back to Kansas for their for their  time at our facility to to really learn and and establish that.  Spread the seed, right?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:04):**  Yeah, that's really cool.  That's really.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:08):**  So that's that's what I do every day.  And and I and of course, that whole pathway in the last 20, 21 years has been strewn with  with a lot of hardships and and difficulties and predatory pricing.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:21):**  And, you know, you start to think and you're going to be able to sell to school districts,  which we had five at one time in Colorado.  And then the big packers come in and just blow you out.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah.  And, you know, the whole farm to school thing has failed.  And we were part of that original Good Food Project here in Colorado Springs to feed kids  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:42):**  good food in District 11.  And that all went away.  They initially saved six hundred thousand dollars the first year and food costs going  
**[0:12:51-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:12:51):**  local and getting rid of Sodexo.  The next year was nine hundred thousand.  And then they decided, well, hey, we've got self-managed now we're saving all this money.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:00):**  What if we would buy cheap food like we were buying before?  Well, that's what they did.  And under a lot of pressure, of course, from, you know, from the superintendent and and  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:10):**  the management and administrative arm of the schools that always are looking at pension  pennies.  So all that's gone.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:16):**  We don't have any more school districts, no school lunch at all anymore.  We had twenty three Chipotle's at one time.  We're going to fifty some and they just told us we're done.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:27):**  They replaced us with Australian beef at 30 percent savings.  And so we've been through this.  You know, I talk about the local food movement is over and I see these new groups that are  
**[0:13:38-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:38):**  out there thinking they want to get a mobile unit and they want to start selling direct  and and and you look at their their performance and they've got wholesale in them.  They're selling to restaurants.  
**[0:13:49-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:13:49):**  And I say, I need you to go in and delete that line because there is no way that you  can sell profitably into the wholesale market as long as Cisco is there selling imported  beef that is far below your cost of production, in fact, procured below the cost of production  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:07):**  in the country it came from.  There's no way you can compete with that.  And they hate it because they really needed that line in there.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:14):**  And they say, well, you know, we've got a friend with a restaurant.  No, you don't.  You may I don't care if it's your brother there when Cisco comes in and offers him the  
**[0:14:24-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:24):**  three thousand dollar kickback to kick you out, plus a far lower price.  It's really hard to keep that restaurant business.  And they're always under a lot of pressure to make money.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:35):**  And now they've got their minimum wage thing coming.  I'm saying take it out.  We've got to build the pathway to the consumer, not to the wholesale market.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:44):**  The wholesale market is a predatory market and it's one where you die.  That's where you go to die.  And so, you know, we want to sell direct to consumers.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:14:51):**  You know, COVID hit in March.  Our retail business was 400 percent of the year before.  And we never ran out of meat because we kicked it in gear.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:03):**  We we had the capacity.  We had the animals.  We simply kicked up the slaughter.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:07):**  We kicked up everything.  We worked everybody's butt off.  I mean, wore them out, but never had an empty shelf in our store as opposed to the big guys  
**[0:15:15-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:15):**  who had completely empty shelves.  And so now that business is one hundred and thirty percent of a year ago.  So you can see how much it's dropped off as the big box stores got reloaded with product  
**[0:15:28-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:28):**  with meat.  Right.  And so we we've also there's another cautionary note is don't depend on people wanting to  
**[0:15:37-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:37):**  buy from the rancher going forward as to the extent that they did initially with COVID.  So be careful.  Don't get overextended.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:46):**  I my good friend Gary Battles, who I think is the best feedlot manager ever and that  there ever was.  He managed the Fairleigh feedlot in Scott City, Kansas, and was a mentor for me years  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:15:57):**  ago.  I remember him saying to me one day, he says, Mike, don't swim out further than you can  swim back.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:03):**  Well, who would have known how deep the water was and how many sharks were in the water?  I mean, who would have ever known that that you didn't have to swim out very far before  hell you were eating.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:17):**  And so I've always kept that in mind.  And so when we think about building this alternative food system, do it very carefully and do it  conservatively.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:24):**  And, and the thing that I think changes the world right now for for ranchers, and for  people wanting to sell direct is public markets, public markets that are owned by the public.  And that's where your cut plant should be.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:39):**  Go ahead, Brian.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  I was just gonna wait for you to pause.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:44):**  You know, Mike, you and I talked several times last year, through March and April, even into  May about meat plants, COVID and how that was going to interrupt the supply chains and  the way that could possibly get into markets.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:16:57):**  And you threw a concept out at me of a small community cooperative nonprofit.  And I didn't I wanted to I wanted to make sure that we kind of got there covered that  concept.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah.  And and Brian, this is this is something that really is around this sort of public market  concept.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:17:14):**  So I think the rancher, you and your neighbors can own a mobile unit, make it a modular unit,  because that way it's tall enough to kill bulls and cows.  If you can start turning your coals into ground beef that you can sell direct, that's huge.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:17:29):**  If we can add value to coal cattle, that's a big deal.  And if and that would have the effect of just improving the price in the overall markets  to some extent or at some at some later date when you have enough volume.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:17:43):**  But but that's a big that's a big deal.  If you can sell coal cattle and get you know, five bucks a pound or something for the ground  beef, which would be very competitive in today's market at retail.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:17:53):**  And so you can do that in your neighborhood, you can you can put that together and try  to locate that that unit in a feedlot.  And the reason I say in a feedlot is because they've got the pens, they've got the feed,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:18:06):**  they got the water, they've got a manure supply to compost your slaughter waste in and whatever  discharge water from your unit you have, which is very, very minimal compared to the big  packers, very minimal, you can discharge into into a pollution pond that is part of their  
**[0:18:24-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:18:24):**  of their Kansas Department of Health and Environment rule that they have to that they have to have  at a feedlot.  And so feedlots make a lot of sense to locate a mobile or a modular unit at and then that's  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:18:39):**  it.  That's your investment.  What you do is your community and your cooperative effort of ranchers.  
**[0:18:45-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:18:45):**  Then the next thing will be what is your closest urban center?  Let's connect the eater to the rancher as directly as we possibly can.  And so what I want to do and Brian, maybe your maybe yours is Salina, maybe it's Wichita,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:00):**  but go to that, go to that community, meet with the city council and say, look, we need  a public market in Wichita.  Everything in Kansas is going to be in this market.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:12):**  There's going to be vendors, there's going to be a cafe, there's going to be a meat market,  there's going to be a cutting room, it's going to be a food hub slash public market.  And and you and you see food hubs that have just failed all across the country because  
**[0:19:27-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:27):**  of the predatory nature of the market.  You can't compete with food waste, which is a other issue entirely that we can talk about  sometime.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:35):**  But but when they're giving food waste when they're given food away as food waste and  getting the tax deduction, that becomes a profit center for big boxes.  And so food hubs compete with with waste in the market.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:46):**  And the other thing, can you talk about the scale of the plants that we're talking about  compared to the big ones, the ones you're trying to introduce?  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:19:55):**  Yeah.  But the thing is that the food hubs have failed to incorporate meat.  And I guess, yeah, I don't know why.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:20:04):**  Maybe the vegetarians have run the food hubs.  But the thing is, meat is is so critical in making that food hub work.  That's your high value.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:20:15):**  And these are these are animals that have, you know, harvested the grass, which is what  you've got to sell, Brian, and it's what I have to sell.  I mean, I don't sell vegetables, don't have the ability to produce vegetables, you know,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:20:30):**  and I'm no long way I'm 200 miles from Colorado Springs.  And so, you know, vegetables aren't my thing.  My heart doesn't like vegetables like it likes cows.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:20:39):**  Yeah, yeah, I just want to see food hubs focus around meat and carcass processing.  And so let's put a mobile unit out there or a modular unit out there I prefer.  And let's figure on 20 cattle a day.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:20:54):**  And here's, here's something that's pretty interesting.  Let's do 20 cattle a day and let's use five people to do it.  That's easy.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:02):**  We can do that.  Five people doing 20 cattle a day is four animals per man.  Well, guess how many IBP gets done per man per day?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:10):**  1.57 animals per man per day.  They aren't efficient.  Really?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:17):**  Just got cheap labor.  That's a shoulder to shoulder, you know, sure.  Like one cut.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:22):**  Yeah, they make one cut.  And then and none of them know the full process, which we're not going to be teaching in these  colleges, assembly line colleges right now that I know of that are putting in meat cutting  
**[0:21:33-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:33):**  curriculums.  And so we're more efficient, we can do more animals per man per day through these units.  And then do all of the further processing, but go direct to retail, don't sell boxed  
**[0:21:45-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:45):**  beef.  And we can talk about boxed beef and what a tragedy that is and what a horrible mistake  it was, what a march of folly it was to even develop it to begin with.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:21:56):**  I mean, you go back, that's really an interesting story about how it all developed.  But when I grew up in Evergreen, Colorado, I was 13 years old when I started working  at the grocery store.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:22:06):**  And and I ended up working in the meat department before I graduated high school.  And everything we did was cut from the carcass.  That was 1969 1968 69.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:22:17):**  And there, everything was cut from a carcass.  And these guys were really skilled butchers.  And they were great to be around.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:22:23):**  And guess what, they drove new pickups.  They drove nice vehicles and lived in houses that they owned, you know, not like the workers  in today's meat industry.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:22:34):**  It was coming back to the ranch gate, we were getting 68% 68 to 70% of the end retail value.  Today, you're getting about 35%.  So not even half, not even lost half 30 years, we've lost half of our share of the consumer  
**[0:22:50-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:22:50):**  dollar because of these predators that stand between the ranch gate and the consumers plate.  And so we're building this model to go around it.  So let's we're meeting now with the with the city council in Wichita, Kansas.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:23:03):**  And we're saying, look, would you people be interested in building or maybe using an existing  structure, hopefully in your city center or near there, that we can house a public market.  And if you guys need ideas on how to make that happen, look at the reading terminal  
**[0:23:19-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:23:19):**  market in Philadelphia, which is the my favorite market in the in the country.  There's 70 vendors under roof, all independent businesses, all paying extremely competitive  and low rent rents.

It's all got to be independent businesses.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:23:41):**  That's what we need in Wichita, Kansas.  And that's what we need in Billings, Montana, in Great Falls.  It's what we need in Denver, and they've killed it in Denver.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:23:50):**  They killed the idea because of the developers, your biggest enemy to a public market is the  developer market, the rent collecting market that that charges too much rent, and kills  the aesthetic or well, no, oh, my gosh, no, these are the most attractive places in the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:24:07):**  world, because there's so many people and so much commerce going on.  What it does is it is it competes with them on the rents that they're charging too much.  And so they it's their biggest enemy.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:24:18):**  But here's the biggest threat to the developer community that runs Colorado Springs, the  one that runs Denver is, is people become a community again, around commerce, around  independent business and around consumers getting good food that's healthy healthcare  
**[0:24:34-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:24:34):**  bills drop.  I mean, all this stuff is so positive.  But the problem to the developer community is it becomes it becomes a community of people  
**[0:24:43-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:24:43):**  who vote.  And when they start changing the city council, the people who represent people instead of  business, that's their huge fear.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:24:52):**  That's their biggest fear is the public market will be a place of political action.  It'll it'll be a place of community organizing.  It's so exciting that we can see that change from the urban center.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:25:05):**  And now all of these people that ranchers, you know, have never really met and don't  know and don't understand, right from the vegetarians who just wanted a good steak they  haven't had, they've never had one, you know, they've never been able to buy a non industrially  
**[0:25:21-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:25:21):**  produced pork chop, and they don't want to eat it because of that reason.  Now these people are all becoming your customers.  In fact, you know, they're scheduling a tour out to the ranch.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:25:31):**  In fact, if you've got a place they can hang out under an oak tree or whatever, they'll  bring their tent and spend the night and teach the kids.  I mean, it will change the world of ranching and of cattle production of pork production  
**[0:25:48-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:25:48):**  by connecting to the end consumer, who now is a motivated member of this community and  is suddenly transformed themselves from this aggressive price shopping consumer, which  the Walton family Walmart taught them to be to now be in a conscientious citizen, and  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:26:06):**  one that cares about the leadership in their own community, and their state and their national  leadership.  So we can change it with food.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:26:14):**  I mean, that's where you really connect to people is over a meal and through food.  And so the public market is the is the key I think to making this happen.  Now what you've got is more demand through that, through the mobile or modular unit,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:26:31):**  then you can possibly meet.  And now you start putting in another one and another one, and you start connecting on the  on the mail order side of the business, because now you've got this place that you can do  
**[0:26:44-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:26:44):**  all this commerce and all of this stuff.  And and, and you can you can start expanding the business now because you've got the community  organizing piece in place.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:26:55):**  Now the school board is going to make better decisions about where their food comes from.  And and oh, guess what administrative salaries are going to come more in line with teacher  salaries.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:27:06):**  And the importance of serving good food is going to students is and how it impacts learning  is going to become important.  So now there went all your coal animals, we got to go figure out how to get more of those.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:27:16):**  In fact, hey, we got kind of an old herd, why don't we go in and just peel off that  that oldest set of cows and replace them with some younger animals right now.  And you can just see this thing sort of evolved.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:27:29):**  I remember when I sat down with district 11 administration, after they kicked me out of  district 11.  And by then I with that I lost all the school districts because everybody was following  
**[0:27:40-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:27:40):**  the district 11 good food program.  I went in and they were extremely nervous thinking I was going to attack them, you know,  for making this horrible decision to get rid of Ranch Foods Direct.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:27:52):**  I said, Look, look, I am I am.  Well, first of all, the conversation went.  The guy in charge of the school food service said, Look, it's our responsibility is to  
**[0:28:05-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:05):**  teach children not feed them.  And the superintendent looked at the superintendent looked at him like, would you kindly suck  those words back in?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:14):**  You didn't say that.  You did not say that, although by God, they both meant it, but he didn't want it said.  And so they started backtracking.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:22):**  And I could just see they were so fearful of a confrontation.  And I just totally relieved the pressure.  I said, Look, the reason I am here is to thank you for the business that we've had for five  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:34):**  or six or seven years.  I'm here to thank you.  Oh, okay.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:38):**  I mean, everything changed.  And I said, maybe someday, someday we can come back and, you know, put the program back  together again.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:47):**  But I'm here to thank you.  And but but I did learn a lot that day about what their real their real mission was, you  know, it's to reduce all their costs.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:28:57):**  And wow, if you could see the graph on administrative costs in education, it's crazy.  It's a 45 degree angle.  And so you can just see your graph.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:29:08):**  Yeah, you can just see any extra money that's coming out of the food.  You know, they're supposed to be separate, but you know, they're not.  I mean, that's going into administrative salaries, increased administrative salaries, more administrators,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:29:21):**  less teacher pay.  Teachers are treated like ranchers.  Teachers are treated like pack and house workers.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:29:29):**  Teachers are treated like USDA inspectors.  They treat them terribly and don't pay them.  So we have a lot's got to change.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:29:37):**  But if we can bring people together around community with good community organizing around  a public market and in major urban centers all over the country and size appropriate  markets in places like Lamar, Colorado, or Pueblo, Colorado or middle the middle tier  
**[0:29:56-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:29:56):**  of cities, it can change absolutely change the world and restore justice in a whole lot  of areas that are desperately in need of it.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:30:06):**  That's a, Mike, I always love talking to you.  When I met you about a year and a half ago out there in Albuquerque out in the hallway,  and we ended up in this three way conversation, you, me and Will Harris.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:30:19):**  Well, really it was a two way conversation.  You and Will Harris were just standing there just chatting.  And I was kind of standing there trying to keep my jaw from falling out of my head with  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:30:28):**  my mind blown, just trying to absorb all your knowledge.  Sometimes I just have to take a step and go, yeah, and then touch my breath.  So mobile slaughter.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:30:38):**  I know that there's a lot of, we're talking about mobile slaughter plants, you know, small  community meat plants and public meat spaces.  And I really love the conversation.  
**[0:30:46-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:30:46):**  So why, you said put the mobile slaughter plant at a feedlot.  And so can you explain why maybe a more of an on farm harvest model is a much more sustainable  and a better model than transporting them to centralized facility?  
**[0:31:02-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:31:02):**  Sure, sure.  And when I, and Brian, when I talk about a feedlot, I'm not talking a hundred thousand  head, you know, captive supply feedlot of Tyson or IVP.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:31:11):**  My ideal feedlot is maybe one that feeds 700 to 1000 cattle, in which case, they may be  under the provision that they don't have to have all the pollution controls if they stay  under 1000.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:31:28):**  But but you do want to be you do want a facility that kdhe Kansas Department of Health and  Environment is going to like, and they like me, they like me because I've got the pollution  controls, I've got the composting site, the composting site is so important.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:31:45):**  You've got to you've got to have that in order to get rid of your slaughter waste.  There was a small plant in Las Vegas, New Mexico, that really went out of business much  because, well, first of all, market access was difficult.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:31:57):**  But they were paying this the city to haul off their slaughter waste.  And they just kept increasing those rates.  And you simply can't afford it, you need to turn slaughter waste into a into a fertilizer  
**[0:32:07-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:32:07):**  and into a compost product that has value that you can sell or you can put it on your  own land and save a bunch of fertilizer costs.  And so so that's why I'm talking about a minute placing these units where the animal is, if  
**[0:32:21-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:32:21):**  you can kill an animal where it is and not transport it, think of the reduction in stress,  and how that directly impacts meat quality.  Do you realize because the big packers have put so many small packers over the last 40  
**[0:32:35-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:32:35):**  years out of business, animals are traveling much further to slaughter, and they're suffering  the shrink, the stress that goes with that.  And that does impact meat quality.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:32:46):**  And not to mention the carbon cost of the transportation.  Oh, absolutely.  And guess but who's paying that cost?  
**[0:32:52-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:32:52):**  The rancher, the cattle owner, the feeder is paying that cost.  IVP is now killing cattle.  So does all of them are killing cattle hanging.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:33:02):**  And so you have to pay the freight to get them there.  And back when I first started feeding cattle in 1978, in that feedlot, the packer paid  the freight, everything was a cash bid, you negotiated a cash bid.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:33:14):**  Back then we were getting 60 something percent of the consumer dollar, you know, 65% of the  consumer dollar, and then it all changed.  So now the producer has to pay the freight that the animal has to suffer the trip.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:33:26):**  There's a lot of cattle today, traveling 600 miles to slaughter, that is just flat out  wrong.  And so meat quality suffers.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:33:35):**  And the other the other thing is, if you can kill animals where they are, your freight  to get the carcass to the consumer is 30 some percent less, because you're not shipping  the slaughter waste, you're not shipping that live animal, you're only shipping the carcass.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:33:53):**  So that's much more efficient to only ship the carcass where it's going to be consumed.  Now there's all the awful and the bones and everything that don't get shipped with, well,  I guess the bones around the carcass efficient halves, but all the awful that you know, all  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:07):**  the waste that's still on the farm and can be easily composted, you don't have a large  amount of at one site.  Exactly.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:14):**  And it's going to get utilized to build soil health, which we think is really, really important,  right.  And so you will have your skulls, you're going to have your feet until you get to boil in  
**[0:34:24-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:24):**  those and selling feet, you're going to have that that that foot joint at least that's  going to be in your bones.  And so basically, you're going to put everything inside a manure pile, you might even add some  
**[0:34:34-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:34):**  additional biomass, depending on where you live and what you've got wood chips work great  corn stalks, you know, some weeds that you bailed up out of a field, anything crappy  hay that's sitting in the windrow.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:47):**  Absolutely.  Yeah, anything biomass that adds heat to the process.  But when you're done, you're you're want to be able to screen that product and get the  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:34:55):**  bones out.  And then what we do at St. Francis is we take those bones and turn them into bone char,  we pyrolyze those bones.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:03):**  And so now we have bone char, which is equal parts, phosphorus, calcium and carbon, then  that gets blended back into a fertilizer, whether it's a compost or whether it's sold  in small bags in Colorado Springs for the for the vegetable people or the you know,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:18):**  the folks that are that are growing food.  It's a wonderful soil amendment.  And so we go we but that's a lot farther than other people are going.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:27):**  Oh, yeah.  But it but it makes so much sense to do it.  And then the value added, right?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:32):**  Yeah, right.  And then after the bones are charred, they're very easily broken up into smaller particle  size, which you can do whatever size you want.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:42):**  We've got a little little grinder that we use.  And and we're able to grind to whatever particle size we want.  But that's just another value add.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:35:51):**  But one of the one of the big things that we have to work on as we as we develop this  model out more and more is we've got to find a market for hides.  When I started in 19 in 2000, when I started in 2000, with Ranch Foods Direct, a hide was  
**[0:36:08-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:36:08):**  worth around $75.  And now a hide is being composted.  They have absolutely zero value.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:36:16):**  But the same consolidation and concentration that we had in the beef packing side and a  lot of other industries as well, we've had in the in the rendering market and in the  hide market.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:36:28):**  And so we've lost the value for those things.  Now that doesn't mean IBP doesn't get anything for their hides or Pison or Cargill or JBS.  Of course, they get paid for their hides.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:36:38):**  But they're processing initial processing a blue chrome processing on their hides, and  there's no doubt going to China, or at least they did go to China.  For to be made into products.  
**[0:36:50-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:36:50):**  Well, why aren't we doing that here?  Well, it's because of the predatory nature of the market and the fact that, you know,  the same predator nature of meatpacking has gone into other sectors of our business.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:37:02):**  So we've got to come up with an idea for some hides.  Let's let's stop throwing these hides in the compost pile.  And that right there alone would add enormous.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:37:11):**  Oh, yeah, income another value.  Now that's a that's a line I want to see added to the performance at some point, you know,  get rid of that wholesale line, but put on the high value line, you know, so we've lost  
**[0:37:25-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:37:25):**  a lot of in in in drop credits, what we call drop drop credit or off all values.  But at Ranch Foods Direct, we're selling all of our hearts and our livers, our tongues  at good values.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:37:37):**  You know, if once you get your product project going, you're gonna you're gonna have a pet  food line with all of those things in it, mostly livers and hearts and ground beef.  People are really concerned about feeding their dogs the way that we have been feeding  
**[0:37:53-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:37:53):**  people that's made us so sick, we've done the same thing to our pets.  We've made them sick with bad nutrition.  And so we've got a very nicely growing business in our pet food side.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:38:08):**  We sell a one pound package of ground pet food.  And then of course, the bones are a wonderful treat too.  So you know, we're selling bones at a good value.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:38:18):**  So but but I want to hit back on that on that public market thing and, and, and how that's  so key to this, the success of these of these enterprises of slaughtering where that animal  is.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:38:32):**  That needs to be financed by the consumer and by the public, not by the rancher, the  ranchers already way out there on his risk and extended on his on his mortgages and his  yummies, he's putting up way more than his fair share of the capital that it takes to  
**[0:38:48-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:38:48):**  put food on the plate.  So let's talk about john ikert's community food utilities.  I think it's the smartest thing I've ever seen.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:38:57):**  And john ikert is one of the smartest guys I've ever met and one of the nicest people  I've ever met, former economist and professor and, and now retired, but but john ikert has  got this concept called community food utilities, where the community, the city of Wichita puts  
**[0:39:16-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:39:16):**  up the money, they put up the place, they own it, no developers are welcome ever, never.  It's the community that owns it.  It's a nonprofit that serves the community, and will most certainly serve the city in  
**[0:39:30-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:39:30):**  a good way.  And so somebody like the Batista brothers, no way no Batista brothers and no developer  equivalents of the Batista brothers.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:39:40):**  And so this is so you first of all, you got to get a city council that's friendly to small  business, and doesn't just cave and, you know, put in a stoplight with an arrow for every  chain that shows up.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:39:52):**  You need them to put the money and the infrastructure in so small businesses can thrive and be protected  from the Walmart's and the dollar stores and all of that, in fact, make dollar stores illegal,  that would be a good thing.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:05):**  Make dollar stores illegal, like Tulsa, Oklahoma, there are a few cities around that have set  a good example.  Why do you hate Dollar General?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:14):**  That's the waste economy.  You know, what we've done is we've developed this industrial model of corporate control  of our economy.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:22):**  I mean, what do they ever do to you, they come into these small communities, they provide  jobs, they you know, they have products that people in a key.  What's wrong with that?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:30):**  Yeah, well, that job, you know, that job works great, along with the welfare check that you  can get or the or the food stamps that you can that you can spend that whatever store  might take them.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:41):**  Yeah, it's it's really a tragedy.  I talked about how Walmart kills and consumes the prey, small business and right street,  and the dollar stores eat the decaying remains.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:40:54):**  So when a dollar store comes to town, it's over.  It's really over.  And little old Falcon, Colorado out east of Colorado Springs has two of them right across  
**[0:41:03-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:03):**  the road from each other.  And so we're living in in the waste economy.  You know, we're living in an economy, the secondhand economy, basically, when the dollar  
**[0:41:14-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:14):**  store shows up.  And unfortunately, we even had a dollar store come to St. Francis, Kansas.  So the cafe that my friend Gordon Ross and I had breakfast at, and a bunch of other of  
**[0:41:24-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:24):**  the farmer and folks in the community, ate at for 20 years, from probably 1990 to 2000,  whatever, went out of business.  And I kept telling the owner and the in the provider in that in that cafe, I said, you  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:39):**  can't charge $4.50 for breakfast.  Oh, yeah, but nobody can afford it.  Nobody will pay more.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:45):**  Well, she ended up going out of business.  So the building was there.  They scraped it and put a dollar store.  
**[0:41:50-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:41:50):**  So the very cafe that had the community table that all of us met at every morning at six  o'clock for 20 years, where we did good things for the community where we planned and did  neat stuff, where the Calcrate banner was designed on a napkin or the back of a placemat.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:06):**  And by the way, we saved all those drawings, those engineered drawings.  That's where it all happened.  That is now gone.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:14):**  It is now a dollar store.  It cannot get worse than that.  And so what remains on Main Street is now under the pressure of selling waste at the  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:25):**  dollar store up on the highway, not even on Main Street.  It's up on the highway.  So even in my own town of St. Francis, Kansas, I wasn't able to stop the dollar store.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:34):**  I'm just one citizen.  But at least we can raise awareness, you know?  Yeah.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:39):**  And in the last year, I, you know, we've definitely stopped shopping at dollar stores, kind of  realized some of their implications on the supply chain and we do.  We've encouraged several of our friends to do the same.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:49):**  And you get backlash from somebody.  Oh, well, there's, there's three people that work there.  My sister works there.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:42:55):**  She has a job.  Like, well, what about the grocery store that's suffering that had to lay off two people because  Dollar General put in a food section?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:02):**  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:05):**  And what about the healthcare she lost when she left that grocery store when it closed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:10):**  And she's got a 29 hour a week job at Dollar General, so they don't have to pay healthcare.  So what you got to see when you look at a dollar store or Walmart or most chains is  a business that externalizes its costs.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:21):**  So I always said, if you could see that there was a scanner that when you left a Walmart  would give you the dollar value of what your food really cost.  I'm talking about the cost they've externalized from labor to sick people who eat that bad  
**[0:43:37-0:43:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:37):**  food to the environment, to the meat packing workers, all being paid below living wages.  My God, you can't believe how expensive that food is, but you don't pay it at the register  at Walmart.  
**[0:43:48-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:43:48):**  It's going into the Walton family's pockets and, and, and, and to shareholders.  So that's how you have to start seeing these, these businesses that are part of the waste  economy and part of what causes a waste economy.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:44:03):**  And so what you see selling a dollar stores is a company that went out of business because  Walmart was standing on their neck.  And so we've got all that inventory that has to get sold or thrown away or whatever, but  
**[0:44:13-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:44:13):**  it's going to go through a dollar store first.  And just like the vegetables and the fruit and the produce items at a, at a big box store,  when they give that away to a nonprofit, they get a tax deduction that basically gives them  
**[0:44:28-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:44:28):**  the value higher than the price they paid for it.  So now even the waste that they throw away is making them money.  Plus they get to claim the credit of being a good community member that gives things  
**[0:44:42-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:44:42):**  away a philanthropist type, you know, benevolence to this company that, Oh yeah, there's a good  reason Brian, to shop at that place because they give food away.  Yeah.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:44:51):**  But what did they do?  They gave food away to, and it's reduced the local demand for the, for the community sport  agriculture project that's in town or the farmer's market that's in town.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:45:03):**  And the real evil that had raised out of this, out of this special IRS treatment for food  waste is a company called a food name.  It started here in Colorado Springs and they were getting free food from the big box store  
**[0:45:17-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:45:17):**  and they aren't allowed, they weren't selling it retail.  They were selling it into the wholesale market, the, you know, the, the, the restaurant hotel  institutional market, but they were coming in at half price compared to the regular wholesale  
**[0:45:32-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:45:32):**  market for all these items.  And so when that farmer from the Arkansas Valley that grew those beautiful cantaloupes  or watermelons or asparagus or whatever it may be, and they show up at the back door  
**[0:45:46-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:45:46):**  of the restaurant, well, the food maven truck has just been there and dropped off everything  that farmer has except at half price.  So it just completely destroys your local regional market development.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:46:01):**  When you've got this food waste stream, that's profitable to the supplier, that's giving  you the food waste and putting everyone else out of business because of the, of the low  prices that it's being offered at.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:46:14):**  So that's something that is, that has popped up here in the last several years that really  did just wipe out the wholesale market for, for local suppliers.  And it's only profitable because it only exists because of legislation.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:46:28):**  And it's only profitable because of subsidies.  Absolutely serious subsidies.  And we don't see externalized costs as being subsidies typically do we?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:46:38):**  I mean, we see, we see the farm subsidies for growing corn and soy that we don't need  that benefits the next buyer of that product, which is the big food companies, the big feeders,  the big hog integrators, you know, they're the ones that are benefiting off of that.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:46:55):**  So we, as consumers and citizens, we kind of understand those kinds of government subsidies  for farmers, but we don't have, we don't have any idea the amount of subsidies that all  of us are providing every day in the way of taxes, in the way of supporting these companies  
**[0:47:11-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:11):**  that externalize costs.  I mean, the, I mean, it's, we got so many homeless people, we got so many people living  under the bridge and on the streets right now in Colorado Springs, it's just so sad.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:24):**  And I'll tell you, we had a mayor, the mayor before last that decided he was going to solve  this homeless problem in Colorado Springs, you know, and, and he was, it was just such  a brilliant idea.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:34):**  I can't believe we all haven't thought about it, but his, his idea for eliminating that  homeless problem was to make it illegal.  You know, how simple, I mean, Don it's, it's solved, right?  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:43):**  Right.  Yeah.  Let's just make it illegal.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:46):**  I mean, he made it illegal.  That won the war on drugs, right?  We just make it illegal.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:49):**  Absolutely.  You make it illegal.  And, and basically his, his, you know, his town cops are patrolling the, you know, the,  
**[0:47:55-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:47:55):**  the stream side locations along Fountain Creek and elsewhere, and they're just running them  off.  Well, what, where'd they go?  
**[0:48:05-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:05):**  They went somewhere else, but we certainly as heck didn't solve the problem.  And of course, this was one of those city mayors that, you know, if a Walmart wants  to come to town, you know, well, I'll tell you what, we'll give you a stoplight.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:17):**  We'll give you a turn lane.  In fact, would you want a double turn lane perhaps with an arrow?  We'd be happy to do that for you.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:24):**  Do you want some tax breaks and maybe some free utility too?  Oh my gosh, yes.  The Walton family has more wealth than 40% of Americans.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:30):**  Let's give them a tax break.  Of course, at the end, at the same time, you know, they're, the small businesses just going,  they're filing their bankruptcy papers.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:39):**  Because they're raising taxes on Main Street every day.  You bet.  And they don't have any customers because of the aggressive price shopping consumerism  
**[0:48:46-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:46):**  has taken over.  Honestly, if you want to treat a disease, I'd love to find a cure for it.  But the aggressive price shopping consumerism is one of the, one of the worst things we  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:48:56):**  can do.  And, you know, for self-interest, it's contrary, it is the most contrary thing to our self-interest  that there is being an aggressive price shopper.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:04):**  So I go into Ace Hardware here in Colorado Springs, one of the, of course, one of the  better hardware options.  And they say, do you have a rewards card?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:13):**  Every single time I go into Ace, do you have a rewards card?  And I say, no, I want to pay more.  I say, no, I want to pay more.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:23):**  And they look at you like, are you crazy?  And I say, no, I want you to get paid better.  I want you to get a living wage.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:31):**  And they'll look at me like, Oh my God, you're a wonderful person.  But then they'll say, well, that'll never happen.  Because it's going to get sucked up into shareholder returns, right.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:43):**  Or whatever.  But, but still, I think that has to be the attitude.  All these discount cards and, you know, you know, payback cards and all this baloney out  
**[0:49:53-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:49:53):**  there that we get a wallet full of cards, and I don't want any of it.  I want to pay.  I want to pay a fair price because I know that's how an economy should work.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:50:02):**  So yeah, a little earlier, you kind of almost veered off down a rabbit trail.  I was hoping you'd go down talking about how corn and soy subsidies end up mostly in the  bank accounts as profits in these multinational meat corporations and any of the multinational  
**[0:50:19-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:50:19):**  food corporations that produce baked goods like, I hate to call them out, but like, Netlle  and Kraft and General Motors.  Can you unpack that a little bit, Mike?  
**[0:50:27-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:50:27):**  Well, if you don't have a marketplace that fairly distributes dollars within the economy,  competition is so, so important.  And this is why when we declared our independence in 1776, what we were really doing is declaring  
**[0:50:42-0:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:50:42):**  our independence from monopoly.  And back then it was the crown.  It was the crown and it was the East India Company, the corporation of that day.  
**[0:50:51-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:50:51):**  And so we were leery of corporate power from the very founding of our country.  And we hated monopoly.  And we've shown our hate for monopoly.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:51:00):**  Again, the robber barons when we broke those guys up in 1900 and into 1921, when we finally  broke up the big meat packers.  And so our country is, as a rule, has hated monopoly.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:51:13):**  And the reason we hate monopoly is because they interrupt the economy and the flow of  dollars from the consumer back to the producer or the worker.  And so when you inject that abusive market power of monopoly, then what happens when  
**[0:51:28-0:51:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:51:28):**  you as a solution to lift producers so they don't all go broke and we starve, we decide  we're going to subsidize them.  Well, rather than break up the monopoly and restore competition, we feed the monster.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:51:44):**  We give the monopoly more money because if you give a farmer the ability to produce for  less by subsidizing him, then the market is going to fall like on corn or soy or wheat  or cattle or whatever it may be.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:51:58):**  The big corporations are simply going to pay less.  And boy, did they.  And Brian, you talked about the producer share of the consumer dollar right up front.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:52:07):**  It was 70 percent.  Now it's 35 percent.  We've lost half our share of the consumer dollar.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:52:14):**  And that is because of monopoly power and abusive market power of big corporations.  And so any subsidies that we give out, even if it's to workers, well, then we just lower  the wage or we take away the health care or we do something to keep them in the same place  
**[0:52:31-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:52:31):**  that they're in.  And that is a place of poverty and despair and modern day slavery.  Exactly.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:52:39):**  And so rather than subsidize and making taxpayers pay more for everything via their tax dollars,  break up the monopoly power and restore competition into the marketplace.  And I am not talking about rancher rancher to rancher competition.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:52:56):**  I'm talking about overall competition.  I'm not talking about beating the crap out of your neighbor and selling your calves cheaper.  I'm talking about competition in the various sectors in the in the industry, from retail  
**[0:53:09-0:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:53:09):**  to meat packer, back to the feedlot and to the to the ranch gate.  We just need an environment of competition.  And good things happen when you do that.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:53:20):**  And so, you know, IBP has been on a mission from the very, very start when they started  their company, which is now Tyson IBP.  But they've been on a mission to eliminate competition.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:53:30):**  In fact, I heard that there was a really good book I read here lately called Post Corona.  And it was about this professor of economics and finance at some Eastern University.  And he was saying, the only thing I will invest my money in is monopoly.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:53:49):**  I won't invest in anything except a company that has a monopoly position in the marketplace.  Because guess what?  Nobody else has a chance.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:53:58):**  In the end, nobody else has a chance.  You've got to invest in the monopoly.  And so why is Wall Street doing so good when America is doing so poorly?  
**[0:54:08-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:54:08):**  It's because Wall Street represents the monopolies of our country in the world.  That is something that is contrary and inversely related to the welfare of Main Street workers  and small business.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:54:23):**  And so the more you see Wall Street going up, the more you're seeing the opposite occurring  in St. Francis, Kansas, in rural America, all across the country where people actually  do the work.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:54:35):**  Look at look at healthcare.  Look at the hospitals in California that have the monopoly on healthcare and what they've  done on charges, on hospital charges.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:54:44):**  It was on 60 Minutes the other night is the reason I bring it up.  They totally have a monopoly.  It's during COVID.  
**[0:54:50-0:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:54:50):**  I mean, yeah, they can't even distribute the vaccine.  They're so concentrated and consolidated and so poorly managed, with so much of the money  going to administrative rather than to doctors and nurses and healthcare workers.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:04):**  So it is time for a reckoning right now we have to break up monopoly power.  And there's four really good books out right now on that if you go to my blog, you'll see  them on there.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:14):**  Well, let's take a minute and define monopoly because maybe not everybody has a clear concept  of what you and I, of what the three of us do, about what we're talking about with the  meat packer monopoly because on the surface, somebody can look at it and say, oh, well,  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:28):**  there's four meat packers and they only have 83% of the market.  How is that a monopoly?  So can you break that down a little bit, Mike?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:35):**  Well, technically, it's not a monopoly.  It's an oligopoly.  You know, they're the buyer, so they're not the seller.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:42):**  So on our side, from the cattle producers side, it's really an oligopoly.  But who wants to define all that stuff?  I mean, didn't we all grow up playing that horrible game called Monopoly?  
**[0:55:52-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:55:52):**  You know, and don't you remember when you were the first one out and had to sit on the  couch and everybody was making fun of you?  And when my little nephews and nieces want to play it, I'm like, no, thank you.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:03):**  I hate it.  It's a game that divides.  It's a game that divides.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:09):**  Nobody likes each other when it's over.  It's not a good game of Monopoly if the board doesn't get flipped.  Or have you seen the little clip with a boy crying and then she goes, why are you crying?  
**[0:56:21-0:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:21):**  He's like, taxes, taxes.  Like this is tough, taxes.  But really, it was an amazing game to teach what is wrong with Monopoly.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:36):**  And so basically, Monopoly is concentrated power.  And what we've done with the word is we've expanded its definition, really to cover the  oligopoly and all of the other, you know, monopsonies and everything else that's out  
**[0:56:49-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:49):**  there.  Let's not be too technical.  Concentrated market power can get to the level that it is Monopoly.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:56:57):**  And so for meat packers controlling 83, 85% of the beef market in our country today.  In 1975, IBP was advised by a Boston consulting group that they should cooperate with the  other big packers not compete.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:57:15):**  I know that from an executive vice president from IBP that I got to be friends with during  my lawsuit against IBP.  And so ever since then, we've been fools playing in a fool's game because they've been rigging  
**[0:57:28-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:57:28):**  the darn market.  And of course, now you see the result.  They've stolen half of the ranch share of the consumer dollar or the feeder or the cattle  
**[0:57:36-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:57:36):**  producers share of the consumer dollar.  And so we've been played, played by organizations that were captured by the big meat packers  like National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Kansas Livestock Association.  
**[0:57:46-0:58:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:57:46):**  They even took our check off and use that against us to promote the best interests of  these big corporations.  And so monopoly is when power is so concentrated that you lose competition, that the consumer  
**[0:58:02-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:02):**  is getting a raw deal as well as the producer and the worker.  And so back in 1921, Senator John B. Kendrick from Wyoming was given his statement on the  floor of the Senate.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:14):**  And basically what he said was today with the meat packers, so highly concentrated,  five of them control like 50 to 70% of the market.  I've got to look that up again.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:25):**  But it was big.  I mean, they were really concentrated and they owned vertically from the from the railroad  all the way through to the to the retail, basically.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:36):**  And so so what happened was Senator John B. Kendrick said, look, they've got their hand  in the consumer pocket.  They've got their hand in the producer's pocket and they're sucking it out of both.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:47):**  And boy, is that ever where we are today.  And so we need legislators, new legislators.  The old ones, we just get kicked out of there.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:58:56):**  But we need new legislators that will support the breakup of monopoly power.  And we've got such a great group right now with Barry Lynn at open markets.  We've got family farm action and they are really focused on breaking up, you know, concentrated  
**[0:59:11-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:59:11):**  power and an obvious leader right now in this effort is Elizabeth Warren.  She didn't she didn't get the nomination as the Democrat candidate.  But my goodness, she's she's good.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:59:24):**  She's good on on this monopoly power stuff.  And and, you know, when we talk about politics, this is where this is where the rancher gets  in trouble.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:59:34):**  This is where the cattlemen gets in trouble is they want to join a team.  They want to be part of a team.  And I had an attorney, Buck Watson, back in 1996, that told me, he said, you know, my  
**[0:59:48-1:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=0:59:48):**  politics is about addition, not subtraction.  And it's also not about division.  And so what we've done, I think, in in rural America with farmers and ranchers and and  
**[1:00:01-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:01):**  people who have honestly been screwed so long by monopoly power is we've allowed ourselves  to be divided.  In which case you lose.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:10):**  And so I don't really care if they're Democrat or Republican.  Do they do they want to fight to break up monopoly power?  Well, Elizabeth Warren does.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:19):**  Cory Booker does.  Tim Ryan does.  Mike Lee staunch Republican conservative does.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:26):**  I mean, it's the Republicans based on their party platform.  They should be the ones going after abusive market power.  Not a bunch of liberal Democrats.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:37):**  But the Democrats are supposed to be the small government party.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, yeah, but the more concentrated power gets, you know, the bigger the government  
**[1:00:46-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:46):**  gets, because then the concentrated power owns government.  In fact, I put out a blog piece this week about how the temple of democracy has really  become the castle of the lords of big business.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:00:59):**  And you know, we've got K Street.  I was on K Street back when Obama was was that in fact, it was the it was the day before  his inauguration.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:01:07):**  And I was in in Washington, DC, in Tom Daschle and Bob Dole's lobby in office, Austin and  Byrd in there.  And boy, you talk about a palace on K Street.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:01:22):**  And so they've got all the hors d'oeuvres out and you know, they're serving some some  snacks and different things and the inauguration is going to happen.  I mean, it was like that morning at 10 o'clock and it was going to happen at noon.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:01:32):**  And I'm in there with my friend Herman Schumacher.  And Tom Daschle's there, Bob Dole, he's somewhere in the building.  But there's this whole circle of lawyers, young, mostly young guys standing in the circle.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:01:45):**  And I now remember this was this was 2008.  And I said, I said to that group of lawyers, I said, you know what really needs to happen  here in Washington, DC?  
**[1:01:56-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:01:56):**  Oh, what what what's that, Mike?  I said we need to turn K Street into low income housing.  And we need to turn the mall into a garden so they can eat.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:02:07):**  And my goodness sakes, old Herman, he backed up because the fight was fixing to be on.  They hated what I just said.  We need to get rid of those lobbyists in Washington.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:02:18):**  We need a citizen government, not a corporate controlled government.  And so Tom Daschle saw right away that it was fixing to be a real battle.  And and there was going to be some hard feelings, probably.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:02:29):**  He just stepped right into the middle of the circle and he says, Mike is right.  And so that's how it was left.  And that and it's only grown worse.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:02:41):**  It's only gotten worse.  And so it's time for a reset.  It's time to restore competition.  
**[1:02:48-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:02:48):**  It's a time to just to restore a citizen's government instead of instead of a get rid  of the Citizens United thing that lets corporations donate all they want to put up the political  campaigns.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:03:00):**  That's all needs to go away.  And I don't know if it happens under this administration or not, but I'm putting all  the pressure I can on and I'm supporting groups like the Open Markets Institute and the Family  
**[1:03:13-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:03:13):**  Farm Action Group.  And I give you just a little history on the open markets thing.  Barry Lynn, who I really learned my story about about monopoly power from when he spoke  
**[1:03:25-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:03:25):**  at a group that I was part of here years ago, he told the story about how we have declared  our independence from from concentrated monopoly power twice, at least with 1776 in the in  the robber baron era of the early nineteen hundreds.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:03:45):**  And he says, and now we need our third revolution now today.  Yeah, we declare independence from concentrated power.  Barry had it was it was part of a group that worked on this this open markets type stuff.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:03:59):**  And it was financed and funded by Eric Schmidt, which is one of the founders of Google.  So he's one of the richest people on the planet.  And so when Barry started working on monopoly, wasn't Eric Schmidt an obvious target at some  
**[1:04:15-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:04:15):**  point?  And so it all came to an end when in Europe they find Google like five billion dollars  for their antitrust activity.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:04:27):**  And Barry Lynn put out a news release that supported that, that said, good move, Europe.  We've got to do it here in the U.S. as well.  Well, it took Eric Schmidt just about 10 minutes to notify Barry Lynn that he was done.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:04:43):**  His funding was cut and he was on the street.  Wow.  How awesome it was.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:04:48):**  He started Open Markets Institute, which doesn't have any of those monopoly players in there  as funders.  And now now what's it looking like?  
**[1:04:58-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:04:58):**  Well, the the antitrust subcommittee of our of our of our federal government had the hearings  with Google, Facebook and and Twitter and Twitter.  There you go.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:05:14):**  And out of that committee, they voted to break them up.  Yeah.  Now, see where Barry Lynn and this was all this was much of Barry Lynn's doing.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:05:22):**  In fact, Zephyr Teachout and and and some of the others that testified that day were  were part of the Open Markets Institute.  And so now it's kind of come around almost full circle to where Eric Schmidt is going  
**[1:05:37-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:05:37):**  to be faced with with some antitrust action.  I'm very and of course, we just need more Elizabeth Warren's and people of her mentality  in Congress, in the Senate, both House and Senate to push this through, because it's  
**[1:05:52-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:05:52):**  honestly a freedom issue.  It's totally a freedom issue.  If you don't have a market, you don't have freedom.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:05:58):**  There's not you don't even have a semblance of freedom if you don't have a market for  what you do.  And then I remember so they got fined five billion dollars from Europe, right?  
**[1:06:06-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:06):**  I remember talking to that to my internal team and one used to be the founding member  of Google.  And he was like, yeah, that's not a big deal.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:13):**  That's one day of revenue for them.  Exactly.  Google doesn't care.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:17):**  Yeah.  And I thought that's huge.  Like that's that's crazy.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:20):**  That that's no one.  Have you guys been looking at the fines that JBS has agreed to and Tyson is agreeing to  they laugh at that stuff.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:29):**  They they they they've already made the money.  They're just going to get part of it back and then they're going to get it back again  right away out of their supply chain.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:36):**  It's going to come right out of your pocket as a rancher.  It's going to come right out of right out of that worker on the line.  They're going to speed up the chains, watch them speed up the chains.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:45):**  They'll make that money back in a matter of hours.  Yeah, they're just going to sit there, look at their watch ago.  Yeah, it's two o'clock fines paid by.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:06:54):**  Well, if you're going to find a company and if they have honestly done an illegal act,  you don't do a settlement agreement where they they admit no fault, because unless you  take away their power to keep doing it as well as remove their ability to punish.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:07:09):**  I mean, they they are going to punish Congress.  They're going to punish all of us to get that money back.  And they're not going to change a single thing that they do that gave them the Elgatan gain  
**[1:07:21-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:07:21):**  to begin with.  So what's the fix?  You know, we're kind of touching on a little bit of politics and policy.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:07:26):**  And, you know, we're kind of trying to straddle a line and not get partisan.  And I really appreciate that.  So is the fix more legislation or simply enforcing what we have on the books?  
**[1:07:37-1:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:07:37):**  Or is it maybe some deregulation or a combination?  Well, one of the just hit the D reg thing.  Part of the bit what gave us the problem was the D reg mentality of President Reagan when  
**[1:07:48-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:07:48):**  he said, you know, government is the problem.  Well, really, he was just speaking for big business saying, look, we want fewer rules,  we want to be able to make more and lie, cheat, steal without being prosecuted.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:00):**  That's what that really meant.  So I think it's, I think it's actually more effective regulation of the right things,  not just regulations that put small meat plants out of business, or regulation that puts small  
**[1:08:11-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:11):**  business out of business and be careful on the minimum wage.  If you put a $15 minimum wage on to a small business that can externalize that cost, they  can't just raise their prices, they can't just pay less to their to their suppliers  
**[1:08:24-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:24):**  of whatever, you're going to make a big, big mistake there.  I'm all in favor of living wage, totally in favor of people not having to worry about  food and shelter, we've got to pay a living wage, but we've got to be smart in the way  
**[1:08:40-1:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:40):**  we go about it.  And it's just too easy to just say, Okay, everybody has to pay $15, then you end up  with nothing but big box stores and Wall Street based companies that are just going to pay  
**[1:08:49-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:49):**  their raw material suppliers last or their suppliers in general last or they're going  to, they're going to take it from someplace, but they certainly aren't going to take less  on return on their invested capital.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:08:59):**  But Brian, I think what we have to do step number one, is we have got to have a recovery  program for aggressive price shopping consumerism, we have got to turn consumers into citizens  again, we have got to take part we have to be educated.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:09:12):**  And who was it that said, and in an uninformed citizenry, you know, cannot cannot be a democracy,  we have got to figure out how to get informed.  And I'm not talking about all the conspiracy theories and all the lies that we've lived  
**[1:09:31-1:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:09:31):**  through the last, gosh, 20 years, and really in the last four, but we've got to get informed,  we've got to get the truth out there to what really is possible.  First of all, what's the problem?  
**[1:09:43-1:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:09:43):**  And how do we go about fixing it?  And then I think you end up with the more effective government with better people that  aren't, you know, that aren't getting money from the corporations, either through, you  
**[1:09:54-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:09:54):**  know, the Citizens United corporate financing of campaigns, or other ways.  And we start to enforce the laws that are on the books from the Clayton Act, the Sherman  Act, the Robinson Patman Act, and the Packers and Stockyards Act, which is relevant to our  
**[1:10:11-1:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:10:11):**  our friends in the ranching and livestock industry.  We need a Secretary of Agriculture that believes in antitrust law enforcement.  And the one we have, the new one that we have right now is not shown that he is.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:10:25):**  Yeah, well, we've been around with Vilsack before already.  So he's kind of right.  But I'm giving him a chance.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:10:33):**  You notice the stuff I'm putting out on my blog or whatever.  I am not, I am not calling him out.  But I'm, I'm giving him the opportunity to be different than he was the first round.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:10:45):**  When I think that's, I think that's totally fair.  I think that's how we I mean, we cannot make everyone our enemy and expect to move forward.  We've got to work together.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:10:56):**  And I am I am just hoping and praying that Vilsack comes with a different attitude, not  Mr. Monsanto.  Right.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:05):**  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I know you've caught some shade before about, about aligning yourself with  
**[1:11:11-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:11):**  humane society, United States and these other in welfare groups that don't necessarily have  that most producers don't traditionally have a very high opinion.  And I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, we need to get past some of this mentality  
**[1:11:24-1:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:24):**  of winners and losers and align ourselves with some of these other groups that do have  our mutual shared interest in mind at the end of the day, even though they may have  done some stuff in the past, we don't really like or have said some over here, we don't  
**[1:11:36-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:36):**  necessarily agree with as long as we can share, you know, 80 to 90% of our core vision about,  you know, local food, local food systems and making them their place.  You know, Brian, we talked about politics is about addition, not division, not subtraction,  
**[1:11:49-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:49):**  humane society has 11 million members.  And they're pretty motivated folks.  I mean, it may be because they like cats and dogs, which I do, too.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:11:58):**  But these people are not vegetarians.  95% of them eat meat, they just don't want Tyson, JBS and Cargill's meat.  And they certainly don't want Smithfield's meat.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:12:09):**  And so 11 million people 11 million members is power.  It's a powerful group.  And it's a it's a group that industrial agriculture is going to try to create a case against and  
**[1:12:22-1:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:12:22):**  sell it to the producers, the ranchers, the farmers to hate because they don't want them  against them.  And when I we went in there with the Organization for competitive markets, and aligned with  
**[1:12:32-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:12:32):**  HS us on the checkoff issues, country of origin labeling, they totally agreed with this, we  need country of origin labeling, we want to know where food comes from.  And the checkoff is one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated.

That's got to go.  But at the same time, we had these groups, like humane watch, which is Dr. Evil, what's  
**[1:12:55-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:12:55):**  his name?  That 60 minutes special was on Richard Berman, Rick Berman, and he's out there putting all  these videos out about how bad the Humane Society is.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:13:06):**  Well, you know, that's, that was a lot like the QAnon conspiracy stuff.  It honestly wasn't true.  But it didn't matter if it was true, because he was able to plant the seed of hate and  
**[1:13:18-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:13:18):**  contempt against HS us.  But the fact is, they did us a lot of good during that alliance.  They supplied the legal help to file the cases, which haven't gone anywhere.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:13:29):**  Because we don't have a fair judiciary, we've got a judiciary that really supports big business.  And and so we got a whole lot of work to do.  But it is important that we align with other groups that have similar interests, you know,  
**[1:13:42-1:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:13:42):**  even like with our cap, they aligned with the with the consumers union.  Now there's even a bigger group of people that we should most certainly be aligning  with.  
**[1:13:51-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:13:51):**  And please, you've got to understand, everybody listening has got to understand the consumer  is not the enemy.  And when I got into Ranch Foods Direct, I, I mean, it was such a wake up call, because  
**[1:14:02-1:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:02):**  now I was dealing with the people who were buying the food and eating it.  And man, is there ever a variety of beliefs and, and, and, you know, people, different  kinds of people and all.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:16):**  I mean, it's just, it's wonderful, really, that we have this diversity.  And oftentimes, I think from the agricultural community, we have rejected diversity.  I mean, go back to St. Francis, Kansas, it's a German Russian community.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:31):**  It's white.  And I remember when my oldest son was in school, and that black kid showed up, his mom worked  for the telephone company.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:39):**  And she was a single mom and had a black child.  And what an awesome kid, and all the kids in school loved him.  He was a fantastic wrestlers name was Kyle.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:49):**  And but he was unique.  He was this weird thing that came to St. Francis, he was black.  And none of these kids had really been around black kids, they may have seen him.  
**[1:14:58-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:14:58):**  But you know, this was way back, you know, 40 years ago.  But we reject diversity in many, in many cases.  And we honestly think our success may have to be at the expense of another person.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:10):**  And that is just a flawed argument.  We are we are successes is, is going to be dependent upon the success of everyone.  And you know, we create a lot of wealth in agriculture.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:21):**  It's really where the wealth comes from.  Soil, water and sunshine is if in a continual miracle wealth created every year.  And we are the wealth creating engine, but we are the also the ones that are the most  
**[1:15:32-1:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:32):**  impoverished.  I mean, honestly, Brian, we get a negative return on our asset.  We eat into our equity.  
**[1:15:40-1:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:40):**  We don't even get a wage.  I mean, a farmer or rancher selling below cost of production is is you get paid.  He's worse off than anyone else in the economy.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:51):**  Because I mean, look at the suicide rate among agricultural producers.  I mean, I live through the 80s.  I mean, the 80s.  
**[1:15:58-1:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:15:58):**  And we're back.  This is worse.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:02-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:02):**  Well, and then we got these guys like Bill Gates buying up the farmland.  Oh, yeah.  And all it is because he's got too much money.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:08):**  And where are you going to park this much cash?  Good investment, you know.  So let's talk about that for a minute.  
**[1:16:16-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:16):**  You know, we talk about you said there's 11 million members of the Humane Society.  You know, how many people work in ag?  Like what?  
**[1:16:23-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:23):**  Yeah, million.  Yeah.  That includes like all the Margaret migrant farm workers that come in and pick crops that  
**[1:16:31-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:31):**  include seasonal labor.  That's not the people that are and they have no vote.  They have no vote.  
**[1:16:36-1:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:36):**  And that doesn't include the number of people that do what you and I do and some of our  previous guests that are full time livestock.  That number is is a shockingly small percentage of the population.  
**[1:16:49-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:49):**  Like there's less than a million of time rating cattle.  And you want to talk about a minority voice.  We've got the minority voice, even though you know, we're sitting here a couple white  
**[1:16:59-1:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:16:59):**  white guys and the last couple guests have been white males and we are changing that  next guest.  We do have a lady coming up for our next guest scheduled.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:17:07):**  We're trying to bring in, you know, and we're trying to give everybody a voice, not just  an existing producer.  So something else I want to get into is you talked about the checkoff.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:17:17):**  The checkoff promotes sales of and us as cattlemen, we just want to sell cattle.  So we're getting we tell us how the checkoff screws us.  Well, the control of the checkoff lies in the hands of the National Cattlemen's Beef  
**[1:17:29-1:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:17:29):**  Association, which is really a meat packers organization.  They claim to be the Cattlemen's Association, but then they added beef in and they put the  big meat packers on the board.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:17:39):**  And it's now really just a meat packers organization.  And so basically what they've done with the checkoff is they've got an 80 some million  dollar marketing budget to market beef and to benefit the packers.  
**[1:17:52-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:17:52):**  And much of that money is diverted to lobbying.  So much of that money is going on into into Washington, D.C. to get the kind of legislation  that benefits big meat packing, big retail over the producers who have to pay the checkoff.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:18:09):**  And so basically what you've done is you've been asked to buy your own hanging rope and  you have got that done.  And in fact, almost well, over 40 percent of you of us that have bought our own hanging  
**[1:18:25-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:18:25):**  rope have literally died that we have.  We are literally out of the business.  And if you are a cattle feeder, a farmer feeder, eighty four thousand of you have died by that  
**[1:18:37-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:18:37):**  hanging rope and you have absolutely no voice, as you've said earlier, no voice.  I mean, we are such a minority that we can't get anybody to pay attention, even though  we are critical and essential to the economy and to human survival.  
**[1:18:52-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:18:52):**  So we do have to align with others.  And that checkoff is being used to divide us, to keep us divided.  And so you got the big feedlots that are aligned with the meat packers.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:02):**  They're going to be on the other side because they're they're benefiting from the checkoff  because they got a sweetheart deal with a big packer and they aren't being affected  by low cattle prices or the independent farmer feeder.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:15):**  He's already he's wiped out.  He may he may still have a little equity left, but he'll get that he'll get rid of that here  on the next round or two or the next Tyson fire or the next covid outbreak where they  
**[1:19:26-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:26):**  totally destroy the market for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  Yep.  So, yeah, the checkoff is a is a terrible thing.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:35):**  And I, you know, I've been fighting it since 96.  I didn't vote for it.  I didn't want it to be controlled by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:43):**  I'm not saying a checkoff couldn't help us, but it certainly can't help us when we don't  have any control over it.  Right.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:49):**  The attention, I think, was good.  Right.  Ranchers don't market their beef very well.  
**[1:19:54-1:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:19:54):**  So we need someone to help with that.  But I think it's definitely like you guys have said, not done that.  But when I heard Bob Peterson, CEO, president of IBP, speak to the governor's conference  
**[1:20:06-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:06):**  in South Dakota in 1996, and he told us that we don't care about quality.  We only care about quantity.  We're cooking your meat like the pork and chicken.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:17):**  We're going to cook your meat.  What flavor do you want it?  I mean, what a horrible thing to tell a bunch of ranchers, a thousand people in that in  
**[1:20:24-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:24):**  that auditorium that day, most of them cattle producers, to tell them that he didn't care  about quality when they raised the best cattle on the planet.  Right.  
**[1:20:33-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:33):**  And I knew then that that checkoff wasn't about promoting quality beef.  It wasn't about promoting the interests of ranchers.  It was and that was 96 when they merged in CBA and the checkoff together.  
**[1:20:45-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:45):**  And I said, oh, this thing's on the wrong track.  And guess who's on the board?  Guess who's on the board now of in CBA IBP?  
**[1:20:53-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:20:53):**  Full circle, I think is what it sounds like.  Yes.  No, I think we unpacked a lot and I were coming up at time.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:01):**  So is there anything else you'd like to say before we end?  Also, our listeners, how can they get a hold of you and where can we find your blog?  Absolutely.  
**[1:21:11-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:11):**  I'm my blog is Mike Callicrate dot com.  So you'll see what I do if you go to Mike Callicrate dot com, C A double L I C R A T  E. And you'll see what all the things I'm involved in on that on that page.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:25):**  But then you can click on the blog.  I've also got a listserv you can subscribe to.  And I don't just cover you up with news and stuff.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:32):**  But when I see something that I think is really important, I make that available on my on  my news listserv.  And then I'll do a blog post, you know, periodically, not not too much of that as well.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:43):**  But But anyway, that that's how you get a hold of me.  And I'm somewhere between St. Francis, Kansas and Colorado Springs every week.  I go back and forth right now I'm driving the carcass truck, because we I'm using a  
**[1:21:56-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:21:56):**  smaller truck, not not using the semi trailer, because our docs under construction that's  going to be done in the next two weeks.  That's going to be really exciting.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:03):**  And I'll put some of that up on the blog.  So people can see, this is going to be a model of a slaughter facility that's going to we're  going to want to replicate around the country.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:11):**  So Brian, when you get your modular unit set up, and you've decided, okay, we want something  more permanent.  I'll have a design for you to build it.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:21):**  Yeah, it's gonna be really cool.  Yeah, yeah.  So I think that's one of the things.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:27):**  Yeah, just one other thing we like to touch base on is if you could give advice to any  young person like me, who wants to get started in the same kind of direction you're doing,  what would what would your advice be?  
**[1:22:40-1:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:40):**  Well, I'd form a public market community, infrastructure community, a public utilities  committee committee, and I'd start building that out.  And I always talk about how I want to start with the end in mind, who was right said that  
**[1:22:52-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:22:52):**  I forget, anyway, some guy that was really good.  But anyway, start with the end in mind.  So don't just go buy or go, go, don't go buy a bunch of cows and sell into a low calf market  
**[1:23:06-1:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:23:06):**  in lose your grandma's money.  That's really not what we should be doing, or family and friends money of any kind.  We don't want to write that.  
**[1:23:14-1:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:23:14):**  So let's begin with the end in mind.  Let's let's implement the community food utilities concept.  Let's create the market, and then let's start building that supply chain into it, which  
**[1:23:24-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:23:24):**  we can do super fast.  We can do it really quick.  And but I want to start with that with that public market that connection to the end consumer.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:23:33):**  And guess what that's going to do?  If we get that done in a few cities, all of a sudden, the big packers have a really rough  time explaining why they have to buy those cattle so cheap.  
**[1:23:45-1:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/4--Mike-Callicrate-Its-time-for-a-third-revolution-against-monopolies-esfrcp#t=1:23:45):**  And all of a sudden, you go from 35% share of the consumer dollar to 40 and 45.  And in the next 10 years, you're back to 65%.  And rural America is alive again.

I am good Brian. How are you doing?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:01:47):**  I'm doing outstanding. It's a well  I'm doing I guess I'm doing pretty good all things considered like a lot of the rest of us. I could use a rain  very very desperately but  
**[0:02:00-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:02:00):**  We talk about drought later. Let's talk about John Weir. So  Before we get into it. I've known you for years. I know where you're at and I know what you've been doing  So why don't you give our listeners a little bit of a taste of who you are and where you're at?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:02:14):**  Well, my name is John where I'm assistant  Associate extension specialist here in the natural resource ecology management department at Oklahoma State University  been at OSU for 32 years now, I  
**[0:02:27-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:02:27):**  Spent the first 16 years of my time here running the OSU research range a research ranch  Out west of Stillwater  Then when the natural resource ecology management department was formed  
**[0:02:40-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:02:40):**  I was asked to join the faculty there and I've been there been here ever since so doing that  I work I teach classes I do research on fire ecology fire effects  patch burning all the deal and  
**[0:02:57-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:02:57):**  Extension duties as well looking I guess I am the extension  prescribed fire fire ecologist here for Oklahoma and the southern Great Plains  I like to say a lot of times I say I'm the extension specialist for Kansas, Texas and Nebraska a lot. So  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:03:13):**  I'd be happy to claim you  I'd be happy to claim you because  Kansas State does  
**[0:03:20-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:03:20):**  Not really recognize what goes on in the red hills. Yeah  doing that I grew up here in Oklahoma, so I'm  Oklahoma grew up in southwest, Oklahoma  
**[0:03:31-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:03:31):**  and I went to the school at Cameron down at Lawton and then went to Texas Tech for a couple years got my masters and  Got to come back here to Oklahoma  Been here working at OSU ever since  
**[0:03:46-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:03:46):**  32 years you said 32 years. Yeah, I don't seem like that. I don't look I don't look a year older  Well, you know it it takes a long time  I'm thinking here that you know, that's  
**[0:04:01-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:04:01):**  32 years  History of working, you know with plots of land like your research plots  That's a long enough timeline to actually see what works in a long term  
**[0:04:12-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:04:12):**  It does, you know, that's that's a that's a thing  You know  We've much of us have talked about and and if you look at the fire a lot of the fire research stuff  
**[0:04:23-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:04:23):**  That gets published and goes on  It's a lot of it's short term stuff it's like two year study, you know somebody working on the Masters or  Two to four year studies looking at post fire stuff and you know, we don't see you know, a lot of times you don't see those  
**[0:04:37-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:04:37):**  Impacts or effects or you report a negative and really and truly if you look at it in the long run  It's positive but nobody's you know, they don't look at a lot of times. It doesn't get looked at  In the long run you see a lot of that. I think with a lot of the wildfire studies  
**[0:04:52-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:04:52):**  Especially where people looking at impacts of wildfires and stuff, especially out west  They only report is a negative immediate impacts that may be negative looking  but the long-term impacts are  
**[0:05:08-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:05:08):**  You know are huge and what most of them are  are well positive on that so  So one of the things that I mean  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:05:18):**  You're the fire guy like in my mind  If I think about fire in the great plains and I have a question I can't answer you're the first guy  I'm probably gonna turn to  
**[0:05:26-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:05:26):**  Well, I appreciate that  And we can talk a little bit about  Let's talk about let's jump right into some of your research  
**[0:05:37-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:05:37):**  Let's talk about some patch burning research and and what you've learned about patch burning and then we can  Maybe kind of segue into you know, timing of burns burn frequency and historical fire frequency  Like I don't think we need to talk about how to actually do a burn because workshops are great places for do to do that  
**[0:05:56-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:05:56):**  And I want to talk about prescribed burn associations today, too. So  Can you lead us off with some of your patch burning research  Okay. Yeah again, we've been we've been working, you know again with Sam Fullendorf since 1999  
**[0:06:12-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:06:12):**  We started that the patch burn study here at Western Stillwater  They're at the research range where I was running it at the time and we started implementing it back in 1999  So that's that man. It's hard to believe that stuff been going on for 23 years out there  
**[0:06:28-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:06:28):**  It kind of puts it into perspective we've gone back  I guess we've burned through those patches like six times seven times now  We're on there fixing to be on our eighth rotation through there that makes you feel old. It's like golly  
**[0:06:40-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:06:40):**  I've been doing this a long time, but it makes it important  So again, you know, we started working on that, you know, and that work is spread out all over the US and Canada international  You know, it's gone really good  
**[0:06:53-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:06:53):**  and  You know the patch burn stuff was you know, initially started to to look at  impacts of that and fire and grazing and you know trying to mimic a little bit of the historical use of  
**[0:07:05-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:07:05):**  of the lands especially the great plains where we had  buffalo larger large herbivores and even  Medium-sized herbivores that used to roam around and how they utilize  
**[0:07:16-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:07:16):**  fire and would follow fire and the importance of fire and what all it could do and you know, we've  We've looked at the all the aspects of that with the patch burning and it's been it's just been a pretty incredible  process  
**[0:07:29-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:07:29):**  And patch burning is just a pretty incredible credible process to get implemented  There's just so many benefits  You know a lot of times we tried to look at it trying to keep an open mind and not say well  
**[0:07:41-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:07:41):**  This is the the end-all cure-all  You know, we were kind of trying to be as negative as we could be but a lot of times  I mean, you just couldn't find any many negatives about it, you know, because again, we looked at  
**[0:07:54-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:07:54):**  at soils and you know and about  You know nutrient quality of soils and plants and things man  It's just you just keep seeing benefits and benefits and then you know  
**[0:08:03-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:08:03):**  You know weight gains on livestock and benefits to wildlife species, you know different ones because again  You're varying all the habitats out there by patch burning not burning the entire landscape, you know  all at the same time and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:08:18):**  Same season and things like that and then the impacts that grazing has on those plant communities  You know what it does and  You know and how it works to  
**[0:08:30-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:08:30):**  You know to me it is it's definitely it's a drought  You know, it's kind of some drought insurance, you know one of those because again, you don't burn the entire place you're burning  Just certain areas every year and you know, you're stockpiling fuel  
**[0:08:45-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:08:45):**  But you don't mean it's also forage for for those times that when it gets tough, you know, we're we're doing that kind of stuff  Yeah, okay  Maybe we should maybe we should define patch burning a little bit  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:08:57):**  define patch burning a little bit  better  Yeah  
**[0:09:02-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:09:02):**  And and I honestly I don't know if there is a really great again definition because there's you know  We try to also keep it where there's not just one specific thing  but what we what I would I define it as is where you  
**[0:09:15-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:09:15):**  Take and you burn a portion of a area  And then you're going to rotate that burn area around that unit  Over time and the the amount of time between burns is going to be  
**[0:09:33-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:09:33):**  Goals and objective oriented to what your goals and objectives are  Possibly what is you know, kind of maybe a historic fire frequency for your region?  You know because as we move further west when we get less rainfall, it takes a little more time for things to recover  
**[0:09:49-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:09:49):**  You know, we're going to have a little longer interval between fires  That we're going going to have and so  You know to me there's also there's really no set definition of patch size  
**[0:10:02-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:10:02):**  You know what, you know, what is a patch size? It's you know, it just depends on what you want to do and how you  You know want to do it, you know, I know people that want to do small patches, you know a bunch of small patches  You know, I guess you could say you know example would be i'm going to burn a third of this place every year  
**[0:10:21-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:10:21):**  And we're going to rotate that every year a third of it the next year and next year  We're going to burn another third different third of it  Some people burn that whole third is one chunk. You know, that's you know, we're going to get this one chunk burn is one third  
**[0:10:33-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:10:33):**  Other people say i'm going to break that third up into 10 different burn units scattered around the area  There's no wrong answer there's no right answer, you know, it's just depending on goals and objectives what people want to do  So there's not really it's not a size thing. It's not a percentage or a fraction thing of a ranch. It's just  
**[0:11:01-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:11:01):**  a bit whatever works for you kind of in in a rotation to keep  In a rotation to keep things fresh and keep things reset and that's so yeah, that's the main thing with  with patch burning it's it's to constantly keep  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:11:16):**  either  Keep fire on the land every year  and to keep  
**[0:11:23-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:11:23):**  Fresh, you know forage for life livestock production is what you're interested in  Also to keep those habitats  For different wildlife species that require certain different habitats, you know, again  
**[0:11:35-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:11:35):**  It moves them and it it doesn't and that's the thing, you know, because a lot of people have always had  You know fires that have gone through their property from some kind of source  And they always complain about oh you can't just burn a part of it because the livestock  
**[0:11:50-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:11:50):**  You know the cattle will camp on and it turns into a weed patch and it just stays that way and it'll stay that way for years  And the main reason is there's nothing else that gets burned after that, you know, and so yes  They're going to go back to that same spot year after year because it's gray short  
**[0:12:06-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:12:06):**  That's what they want to be in is short, you know short stature grass, you know  And forbs and stuff they want to keep it down short  That's where they're going to camp at and they're going to camp until something else gets burned or you fence that you know the historic  
**[0:12:19-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:12:19):**  way to manage that was you either  destock the whole pasture until it grew back enough or you fence that, you know, put temporary fencing up patch  You know cut that patch off that didn't burn and give it time to get up even so you don't have that, you know  
**[0:12:35-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:12:35):**  So you can't keep that uniform grazing across the land  On doing that and so, you know, that's that's totally opposite of what patch burning is but patch burning isn't static  You know, you don't have that one fire and then that's all you get you get multiple fires  
**[0:12:52-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:12:52):**  You can either have multiple fires within a year  But the biggest deal is is you're burning  every year and moving that patch and moving that  
**[0:13:02-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:13:02):**  grazing intensity that focal grazing point  within that  And that's what moves it and again then once that happens they focus their grazing again from our work that we're done  
**[0:13:14-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:13:14):**  You know, they're going to spend 70 percent of their time on those recently burned patches. Yep  That's what that's what they want, you know, and you've seen it you you see it all the time with with that  You know given a choice  
**[0:13:26-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:13:26):**  uh, you know, that's what they're going to do, you know, like  like um, sam always says, uh, you know, if  Cows had matches, you know, they would burn something every day. Yeah, that way they could come back  
**[0:13:37-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:13:37):**  They'd have something fresh all the time. They would I mean you get because I mean that's what that's what and again  It doesn't have to be livestock, you know, there's all kinds of work's been done worldwide, you know showing  all kinds of species of animals  
**[0:13:51-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:13:51):**  Congregate to fire to freshly burned areas, you know, and again there are species that require  Long periods of time, you know, there's certain  Ground nesting birds and stuff that require, you know heavy buildup of fuel, you know 24 36 months post fire  
**[0:14:06-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:14:06):**  that's their habitat, you know, and so you can create that with patch burning where you can't with a  uniform burn that covers the whole landscape or the whole burn unit, but by breaking that up into smaller burn units and  Burning them separately and then rotating that fire by years along that landscape or along that burn unit  
**[0:14:28-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:14:28):**  Good stuff good stuff. Um  so let's let's talk a little bit about historical fire frequency and  You know, I I know that your research covers the whole great plains east west north to south and there's going to be different fire return  
**[0:14:42-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:14:42):**  intervals for different environments. Can you make some generalizations about historical fire frequency on the plains?  Yeah, you know from from work that we've done  And again, you look you look at there's there's there's several great  
**[0:14:55-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:14:55):**  maps  uh and works that different people have done trying to  Recreate again what a historical fire frequency is and stuff, you know  
**[0:15:05-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:15:05):**  and probably my favorite is probably is the folks rich guy and the folks at mike stanbaugh folks out of university of missouri  They in 2012, they published a great map and part of it is because they also they looked at  Fire scar data because again, they run a tree ring lab there at university of missouri, you know  
**[0:15:24-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:15:24):**  And that was a problem a lot of times too is you know, there wasn't a lot of data  too is you know, there wasn't a lot of trees on the great plane so you can't get fire scar data because there's just no  There was no trees but along the peripheries and the edges, you know, they worked on that  
**[0:15:38-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:15:38):**  But also they looked at climate at rainfall patterns, you know again as you in the great plains as you go west  You know rainfall decreases and things like that and probably their biggest thing and that's what I I really and truly  Think about when I think about fire frequency or fire return interval or how often someplace burned  
**[0:16:00-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:16:00):**  Is I look at it this way is it is how?  Quickly or how long does it take for for the fuel that you're using to burn to recover?  Okay  
**[0:16:14-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:16:14):**  And so, you know, we've got it, you know, there's areas especially in the eastern part of the great plains  You look at the flint hills burns annually  You know  
**[0:16:26-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:16:26):**  Uh, and you know, I would argue that that burning annually in the flint hills  I know I I question if that's the best thing long term for the soil for the for the ecology, right?  But i'm looking at fire return. So you've got fuel loads that are able to recover that quick  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:16:45):**  You know, and if you look at some of their maps and things, you know, a lot of them were about two to three years  Again, as you go west it opens up a little bit, but you know, we're talking about  Most all the great plains again of oklahoma kansas southern part texas  
**[0:17:00-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:17:00):**  They're showing anywhere two to four year fire returnable historically and if you think about it  How quickly does it recover and will it burn again?  Again, you know a lot of times it depends on the weather, but that's the other thing we got to remember  
**[0:17:13-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:17:13):**  When you look at you know  We're humans and we always want these numbers and we you know, we want some hard so a lot of time people say well  Burn on a three-year fire return air well, so what that means is we're going to burn every three years  
**[0:17:27-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:17:27):**  Well, if you look at it, it says well historically that's that's what it was  Well, if you look how they drive that is again, you know  They look at a fire scar and look at historical it shows where it's at and so you take that and so aside from that  
**[0:17:42-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:17:42):**  So you take that and so let's say a 30-year period so this tree in a 30-year period  There was 10 fires in that 30-year period  and if you so, you know 10 divided by or you know, 30 divided by 10 is 3  
**[0:17:57-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:17:57):**  but if you look at the  The actual map or the actual scars it'll show well year one it burned year two it burned  Then it didn't burn again to year seven then it burned here 15 and 16 then it burned here 19  
**[0:18:15-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:18:15):**  You know and then burned here 25 and 28, you know up to 10  So there's 10 but it wasn't every it didn't burn every three years like we think  That's what it is. You know some years it burned back to back some years. It was 10 years between fires  
**[0:18:31-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:18:31):**  on that  But the biggest thing to me is is when you're getting fire putting fire back on the land  Which that's what most of us are most people are doing because fire has been excluded for so long  
**[0:18:43-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:18:43):**  We need to go in as as often as we can  early on to  Reclaim that land because you know, that's what most burns  
**[0:18:53-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:18:53):**  New people that are burning are getting going. You know, we call reclamation burn, you know  You've got maintenance burns and reclamation burns  And a reclamation burn is one that we're trying to reclaim that land and get it back to what we want  
**[0:19:06-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:19:06):**  So what are we trying to reclaim it from?  Well again that goes back to goals and objectives a lot of times but we are trying to reclaim it from woody plant encroachment  Typically, you know where we're at cedars  
**[0:19:19-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:19:19):**  And other woodies that are taking over and have displaced different species and things like that that are out there  And so trying to recover that reclaim that and again those burns are always the most difficult because a lot of times we're dealing with  volatile fuels heavy woody fuels  
**[0:19:37-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:19:37):**  You know, we don't have as much fine fuel because the woody plants have displaced a lot of the forage production or fuel production  Whichever you want to look at it and so it takes you know  And so it takes you know drier conditions windier conditions a little more extreme conditions under the burn window  
**[0:19:56-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:19:56):**  To get it done. And so that that it ups our risk a little bit  And then but once we get it to where we want it  We start those maintenance burns where we can burn we can we can reduce the fire return interval because it's not as important  
**[0:20:10-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:20:10):**  Uh, you know, it's important to keep the fire return interval there to keep them from ever coming back  But we don't have to say all right. We got to burn every three years or this isn't going to happen  We can do that. We can burn under conditions that are more that are safer less risk involved  
**[0:20:25-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:20:25):**  You know higher humidities lower wind speeds  Uh, you know things like that and that burns a whole lot simpler and a whole lot safer to do  On that so there you know, there's always big differences kind of in fire types  
**[0:20:38-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:20:38):**  So that like that kind of gave me a good opening to talk about seasonality and timing of fire  You know traditionally here on the great plains we think of  late late winter early spring as the time to burn like the very end of the dormant season you've got some  
**[0:20:53-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:20:53):**  And my benchmark is like I watch winter moisture if i've had a really dry winter  that tells me I should not burn because that indicates we could be going into a drought and I  That's also a good that's why it's a good time to burn because you're coming out of what you know  
**[0:21:10-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:21:10):**  I like to call the winter drought a lot. I average maybe four inches four or five inches of precipitation during the winter  So my fine fuels are going to be dry. My medium my heavy fuels are going to be drier  and those  
**[0:21:24-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:21:24):**  Late spring or those late winter early spring burns. We've had great success  Over the last probably well dad's been burning out here on the ranch  I think since 1986 and somewhere around then is when I got handed my first drip torch and told walk that line  
**[0:21:39-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:21:39):**  Go that way. Yeah, go that way like oh, okay. This is cool. Hey, there's fire behind me  He's here and stop when you get to the fence  Yeah  
**[0:21:49-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:21:49):**  I think there would I think somebody was down at the other end to get me shut down and I didn't didn't go wandering off  Catch that boy. Don't let him go any further  Take his matches away  
**[0:21:59-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:21:59):**  Um  But lately we've started doing a lot of burns in the summer. I guess not a lot  we've been trying to get as many done as we can but  
**[0:22:09-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:22:09):**  There's some different challenges in in burning in the summer. Can you talk a little bit about um  Seasonality of burning and how that can be used to accomplish different goals. Yeah  Can I kind of go back to to where you started? Yeah, you're right  
**[0:22:23-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:22:23):**  You know, that's the traditional burn season in the great plains is that late winter early spring, you know  It depends on where you are south to north relationship on when you really start, you know in texas, you know early spring is  You know late winter is february, uh, you know, and a lot of oklahoma  
**[0:22:38-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:22:38):**  We start a lot of our folks they start burning in in february and as you go to the northern part of the state  you know then it's kind of a march time frame and even some of the april when you get into  Nebraska the folks up there. They're you know late april first part of may sometimes they'll burn  
**[0:22:54-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:22:54):**  Uh again, they're getting to do that  But I but you know  You were right in doing that a lot of that has been focused about around livestock production because again  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:03):**  We're we're coming out of the dormant season things are dry  It'll burn good, but it's also going to green up quickly  And so we're going to dump cattle on there and that's you know, that's what we're doing it for  
**[0:23:12-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:12):**  uh  And and doing that and so but also just like you said  We are coming out of the driest time of the year or the driest season in most especially the southern great plains  
**[0:23:24-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:24):**  is uh  You know december january and february  In march those are or at least december january february are the three driest months especially in oklahoma. That's the three driest months of the year  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:36):**  Or yet we can probably look at it in kansas same way  I'm close enough that I count. Yeah  That's you  
**[0:23:43-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:43):**  That's the driest time of year also  Our weather patterns are set up where we're getting all these dry cold fronts that come from the northwest  And even from straight north from the arctic  
**[0:23:54-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:23:54):**  And typically you look at it man, you know  We get seen a lot of times we can get single digit humidities again. It's dry makes burning really difficult  Also at that time we start to see a lot of burn bands get slapped on  
**[0:24:05-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:24:05):**  You know people trying to burn around burn bands burn through burn bands man  it may you know, you get a lot of consternation between fire departments and landowners and  You know, it's just a you know, but that's again  
**[0:24:17-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:24:17):**  We still try to burn that and then we go back and throw march in the mix where a lot of burning gets done in march  Especially, you know, kansas south  March is the windiest month of the year. That's horrible  
**[0:24:30-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:24:30):**  I know it is it's looking at from and from work  I've done looking at timing of burns, you know, march is the worst month has the least amount of days and times to get burns done  But that's when most everybody wants to try to burn and so it makes things really difficult to do that. And so  
**[0:24:46-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:24:46):**  And you know that gets to be the problem with  Having one single season that we burn under, you know have a burn season and you know and say all right that our burn season is  February through april, you know again that well that's you know  
**[0:25:00-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:25:00):**  Three months we ought to be able to get it done. But how many burn units do you have to get done?  You know, what are the what's the weather pattern what's things going on within that?  A lot of times it gets limited then what happens when you don't get a burn done  
**[0:25:14-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:25:14):**  It backs up to next year it backs up and you you do it for the next year and by doing that, you know again some people  Possibly destock or they rest the pasture to give it enough fuel to burn or do that  And then you go I can't do that again for another year  
**[0:25:29-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:25:29):**  I mean, it's just totally going to throw my whole planning and my management strategies off and so  Man, it just starts to mix up and then pretty soon after a couple of years it gets compounded  You're not getting half the stuff burned because you're trying to play catch up every year. So what do you what do you what do we need to do?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:25:46):**  Well, we need to open that burn window up to where it's  Of bigger and broader when I always like to tell people they always have a lot of time people ask me goes  Well, when's your burn season? I said well we try to start around january 1, you know  
**[0:25:59-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:25:59):**  Try to start as early as we can and then we'll usually try to get done about midnight on december 31st  You know, so here around it fair enough is a burn season  Again, a lot of it again depends on goals objectives, you know, that's your you know, what's your goal and objectives?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:26:15):**  But if my goal is to burn  Mainly burn again for woody plant control for livestock production like that wildlife even  Burning year round then there's all kinds of benefits and stuff that we can pop up and show with that  
**[0:26:29-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:26:29):**  So then let's start burning in that growing season and open it up and a lot of times that you know those growing season burns  You've done enough of them. They're a whole lot safer and they're a whole lot easier, you know on the average  Because we are a whole lot more humid in the summer months because you have more moisture getting pumped in  
**[0:26:49-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:26:49):**  We got southerly flow from the gulf of mexico. We get a little more, you know relative humidities are typically higher  We have green growing grass and plants out there. They're transpiring moisture into the atmosphere which increases relative humidity  You know, everybody talks about all summer is hot and dry  
**[0:27:07-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:27:07):**  Well, and then but summer is also very wet wettest time of the year may june july typically again is our you know  April through april may june july starts to slow down in a lot of regions  We start to see a little less rainfall because we're not really getting a lot of rain in the spring  
**[0:27:23-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:27:23):**  A lot of region we start to see a little less rainfall. But again, we still we get way more  Rainfall from april to september than we do  from  
**[0:27:33-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:27:33):**  october  Through march, you know, and so it's the typical typically whatever typical is in the southern great plains  Is uh, you know, that's typically our wettest time of the year. And so we have way more humidity  
**[0:27:47-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:27:47):**  It's a whole lot safer to burn. You're burning a lot of green fuels that are out there  So that lowers the intensity of the fire. It slows it down makes it safer makes it easier  And doing that and again, we've been we've been doing a lot of that work for man almost 20 years  
**[0:28:02-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:28:02):**  It's been great, you know the biggest thing, you know  That makes you makes you feel good and to see that  It's just like what you talked about. We're starting to see a lot more landowners actually from stuff that we've been collecting  
**[0:28:14-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:28:14):**  Right now about 20 of the burning that's going on is burnt during the growing season now  So we've actually you know, it's actually changed a lot of mindsets  And you talk to people and you know  
**[0:28:25-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:28:25):**  They're able to get more fire on the ground because they don't limit themselves to one season  of the year  Right. I think I figured up once during the you know, the six weeks  
**[0:28:37-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:28:37):**  Of of march in the first two weeks of april, which is traditionally our burning season here in the red hills  There's years but there's  Three days there's years where there's 15, but there's very very rarely more than 15 good days to burn in those six weeks  
**[0:28:54-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:28:54):**  I can take a look at the the chunk of time from june 15th to september 1st, which would be my  My season to do summer burns to meet management goals  And there's like 60 some plus days in there, you know, I would much rather all things being equal  
**[0:29:11-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:29:11):**  If i'm going to burn on a day that it's 80 degrees  I would much rather do it in july  When the wind is seven miles an hour than do it in march when the wind is 17 and right on that hairy edge of safety  
**[0:29:22-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:29:22):**  And you're probably dealing with  30 low 30s on humidities or even less  Whereas at summertime you're probably dealing at a low maybe 40 percent or age  
**[0:29:34-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:29:34):**  And a lot of green fuel a lot of you know green fuels out there that slows that fire intensity down and  Slows the rate of spread down still gets things accomplished  Uh and doing that. Yeah, uh again, should we burn everything in the summer? No  
**[0:29:49-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:29:49):**  You know, it's it's different season again. It goes back to goals and objectives but also  You know, there's there's importance for summer burns. There's importance of spring burns. There's presence burning in the fall  You know, it's all there. Uh, it all has benefits all has pluses all has negatives, you know  
**[0:30:06-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:30:06):**  So we were talking about you know fire return interval and historical fire frequency  And I I think about a lot of the fires that are started, you know  quote in the dormant season that we've seen let's just take the last six years of history from  
**[0:30:21-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:30:21):**  anderson creek wildfire to now  and  It seems like now i'm not a researcher so I haven't collected all this data. This is just anecdotal from what I remember reading  
**[0:30:32-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:30:32):**  is  Almost every fire that we've had  During the dormant season when it's been really dry during when it's cold has been can be traced back to human  
**[0:30:44-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:30:44):**  Source whether it's you know chains on a road power lines flapping together  Pick up backfire and going down the highway. Most of those are traced back to a human source. So the question is  when  
**[0:30:57-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:30:57):**  could nature  light fires on the great plains and I  We can I mean we can have a thunder snow in october so there could be lightning in october. I get that but how likely  
**[0:31:08-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:31:08):**  Would february, you know december february march fires have been  Probably again through through lightning sources again through that natural whatever you'll call if you want to call natural  You know  
**[0:31:21-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:31:21):**  Which would be lightning to me lightning volcanoes  You know, that's naturally occurring fire  We don't have many volcanoes to deal with so lightning doing it  
**[0:31:32-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:31:32):**  But if you look at it historic again when the most work the thunderstorms occur  And you know that will be that spring period into early summer and then you know again  We can like you said we can have thunderstorms year round  
**[0:31:46-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:31:46):**  but the deal is  lightning always a lot of times people look at lightning as the you know,  The source of what was the original fire and what shaped the landscape and that's to me  
**[0:31:56-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:31:56):**  I'm not a big proponent of that and there's a lot of people that don't to me humans  Humans are the the fire sarders and the fire source, you know  You look back historically and you look back now  
**[0:32:09-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:32:09):**  Humans will always manage and shape the land they live on to make life easier simpler  To make them money to do whatever so again native americans burned because  They they saw the benefits of fire for attracting game to make it easier to hunt  
**[0:32:29-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:32:29):**  For their you know when they got horses, you know, they wanted to graze on those kind of areas  Travel corridors so when we we've traveled from one from winter campgrounds to summer campgrounds  We want to make it easy to get through there. We don't have to fight all this trees and brush  
**[0:32:46-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:32:46):**  You know trying to get everything through there. We want to make it easy again. That's why we build roads  But they didn't have that option they use fire also they didn't you know  The the warring tribes would you know could ambush you easily in those densely forested areas or densely areas with dense cover  
**[0:33:02-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:33:02):**  So you didn't want to travel so we burned things, you know  They native americans burned all that because if you think about lightning and what it is  What is it? What is lightning to always accompanied by?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:33:14):**  Usually rain usually, you know any you know, either  either rainfall or high rh's  and  
**[0:33:22-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:33:22):**  That typically puts fires out again. It's the same thing. How many lightning fires do you really see?  Annually or even in a decade  Out there and again, you know granted a lot of times we're on top of them and we put them out pretty quickly because again  
**[0:33:39-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:33:39):**  We've got you know doing that i'm not saying that lightning didn't burn  I mean, I can see historically. Yeah lightning occurred dry conditions not much rain and yeah, it burned a big chunk of ground  But for the most part on average and stuff most lightning fires and stuff  
**[0:33:58-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:33:58):**  Pretty pretty limited. I think they were pretty limited in what their scope and their scale was  And their importance  You know the human set fires the native american fires  
**[0:34:09-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:34:09):**  Those are the ones that shaped this just the great plains  Shaped the nation shaped the world, you know, you can sit follow fire all around the world  You know native people have always burned the landscapes that they live in  
**[0:34:24-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:34:24):**  Because again the benefits that they saw from it derived from it not only for everyday life  But also for safety and things like that, you know, they they use that  Only tool in the toolbox. That's that's what you're gonna pull out. I mean it is again, you know, you can't you know  
**[0:34:40-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:34:40):**  They didn't have no shredders. They didn't have no chainsaws. They didn't have  Bulldozers or anything like that fire was fire was it was it you know, that's what they had  Yeah, they didn't even really have a bic lighter  
**[0:34:53-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:34:53):**  Two rocks to beat together and a stick on fire  You know or carry a some kind of pot with coals in it to the next spot  use them to start a fire, you know all kinds of things and uh  
**[0:35:05-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:35:05):**  and and you know and and i've said a lot too that  Just you know, I think hollywood did a really bad job of portraying native americans as you know, just  Savages that didn't know anything you you look at the historical accounts. They knew fire  
**[0:35:23-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:35:23):**  They knew when to burn it, you know, there's some great stuff that's been  some books that are out there about historical fire stuff and  About you know reasons that they burn, you know, they had it down to  
**[0:35:35-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:35:35):**  There's a great account of some tribes in california  that were  Really big into basket weaving and so they used rushes and sedges and wetlands to to weave their basket with well  
**[0:35:46-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:35:46):**  They they learned that if they burned those areas  And then come in after you know after the fire  Those made baskets that were stronger lasted longer and things then then if you use old growth rushes and sedges  
**[0:36:00-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:36:00):**  You know, we used fire, you know, make it, you know arrow making they did it all the way down to again  It's some of the shrubs or trees that they use to make arrows from  That if they burned it off top killed it then it would resprout and the resprouts would grow long and straight  
**[0:36:14-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:36:14):**  You know, so make great errors if you didn't do that  You got gnarly twisted, you know old growth that you could make a good arrow out, you know  So even just down to the small details they had it down with fire  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:36:29):**  You know pretty interesting  Okay  You know it your comment about how many fires of lightning start?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:36:37):**  In the last decade it just on my ranch in the last five years. There's been three  In the last decade it just on my ranch in the last five years. There's been three  One of them one of them was actually this past summer  
**[0:36:55-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:36:55):**  And  I don't know how much rain fell that day, but it was just enough to put out the fire because it was  it  
**[0:37:04-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:37:04):**  The lightning bolt hit one of my fence post on top of the hill  On my fiberglass fence post it melted the clip off and vaporized about 50 yards of wire  And and that was it I just said and then there was a spot there that was burned  
**[0:37:18-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:37:18):**  I haven't been back there to in a couple of weeks  We were actually burning one of our patches. Oh, it's probably been about six seven years ago on one of our places  And it was a summer burn and we got we were burned alone  
**[0:37:32-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:37:32):**  We're about to get the backfire totally finished and I come up in there and I looked at the cedar and it was kind of  brown at the bottom, you know kind of like I said  You know, we haven't burned, you know, we haven't burned here in three years  
**[0:37:44-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:37:44):**  Why is that brown and then I got to looking and there was an area around that cedar tree that had regrown?  But it wasn't quite as tall as everything out there and it didn't it wouldn't burn  And I was looking at it and I looked at the cedar and there was a crack in the bark and all that  
**[0:37:58-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:37:58):**  It got struck by lightning and it burned an area that was maybe  I don't even think it burned a quarter of an acre around that cedar  But you know the rain had put it out. We never we never had a clue that that thing even had started out there  
**[0:38:10-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:38:10):**  You know, there's a lot of that I think that goes on  Yeah on small scale  Yeah  
**[0:38:19-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:38:19):**  So let's uh, let's shift gears and talk about the threat of woody encroachment on the plains  It's there isn't it? Oh man, um, you know  We we can kind of dive off into rangeland the rangeland analysis platform. I've talked about it a little bit  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:38:37):**  on the show  and  It's not  
**[0:38:41-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:38:41):**  I don't want to say that it's that it isn't user friendly because it is  Yeah, but you kind of got to know what you're looking for what you're looking at and yeah  And I know that's not not necessarily your wheelhouse. We I'm trying to get direct twidwell  
**[0:38:56-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:38:56):**  To return an email so I can get them on the show to talk about wrap and and its role. Um, so maybe you could could you  Give us just a brief background  On rangelands analysis platform and then tell us how you use it. I don't haven't used it a lot  
**[0:39:11-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:39:11):**  But again, i've been on it looked at it. Um  and  You know, then it's it's a great tool again. They're getting more and more. I know lord  
**[0:39:20-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:39:20):**  Goodman just told me yesterday they'd got it up and running now that you can look at  You can look at  forage loss by county  
**[0:39:29-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:39:29):**  Due to woody encroachment pretty much throughout all the great plains looking at all that, you know  That's scary to see how much forage by county that we're actually living, you know  You could do that for your own ranch. You can go on and you know outline that so again, you can look at productivity  
**[0:39:45-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:39:45):**  You know, they've got that new part of it where you can get they're they're estimating current production for the ever for the past 16 days  So you can kind of look at that and see where that production lies within there  Uh, you know you flip it to bare ground shrub cover tree cover  
**[0:40:03-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:40:03):**  uh, you know for specific areas large areas, uh, and it's really  There's just a lot of man. There's so many things you can do with it and look at it  You know a lot of it's just spending some time on there  
**[0:40:15-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:40:15):**  and doing that it is  It is user friendly to point. I think I think part of it is there's just so much stuff you can do with it  You don't know where to start. You know, I think that's a big part of it because it's pretty uh  
**[0:40:27-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:40:27):**  And then what do you do with all the information? Yeah. Yeah, and then what do you do with all it?  Yeah, a lot of it is to look at and see hey  Yeah, i'm getting i'm getting way behind the eight ball here because of woody plant encroachment, you know, and this is you know  
**[0:40:40-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:40:40):**  This is where it's at. This is what i've got. Um, you know, that's it. That's a big part of it and I see that  There's a lot of people using that to start mapping things, uh, especially on watershed scales or you know more landscape scales kind of stuff  But again, it's still even great for an individual, you know looking at at your own properties and things like that  
**[0:41:04-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:41:04):**  My favorite thing to do with it is take like the oldest series that they have  The oldest data they have to show the the tree cover in the great plains  Yeah, and then the newest one. Oh, I know it. Oh you you get people's attention with that  
**[0:41:19-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:41:19):**  Yeah real quick. Uh, and then then again, and you know, like I said if they're producers, you know livestock producers  You flip that over and look at  Forage look at total forage production  
**[0:41:30-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:41:30):**  Over that same time scale and go, you know from it went from there and usually it's at half of what it was  30 years ago  Yeah, so it's half you you've lost half  
**[0:41:42-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:41:42):**  Of what you've got, you know, and the sad thing is a lot of people have not changed the stocking rate since then  You know, it's like well grandpa run 30 head on this place. I can do the same thing  well grandpa didn't have 30 plus percent cedar cover out here and  
**[0:41:57-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:41:57):**  Woody plants and then you you haven't changed the stocking rate. There's no way you're going to get a fire to go anyway  because it looks like a  Tiled floor out there pool table covered with cedar trees. Can you relate?  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:42:11):**  A percent canopy cover of cedar trees to forage production loss  uh  Yes, you can you know  
**[0:42:19-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:42:19):**  Dave engel did a bunch of great work on that early in the 90s and stuff on on that and showing that you know the production  Uh, you know, he had some see i'm trying to go up out my head. That's some great numbers that like  400 trees per acre  
**[0:42:35-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:42:35):**  you know you which  400 trees per acre kind of depends on size, but these were all small trees invading  You know, you you already were down to about half of forage production within that so you start looking at cover  
**[0:42:48-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:42:48):**  you know again you think that  50 percent cover stuff 50 percent cover is a lot a lot of times people will look at 50 percent cover and say  Oh that thing's totally covered with cedar. Well, it's  
**[0:42:58-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:42:58):**  It's not but it's it sure looks like it again. You definitely have lost  50 percent of that ground cover, you know, so again as you start to as that number starts to increase, you know  Your production starts to decline  
**[0:43:12-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:43:12):**  You know and then it's going to get that point where they meet and then they just fall off  You know in doing that and then we're left with an eastern red cedar forest. That's right and you know, and again, it's  You know, what's that? What's that really good for? You know, well, I mean  
**[0:43:30-0:43:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:43:30):**  So  We can play that game. I mean some of the environmentalists, you know, they love to say trees are good cows are bad  Trees are good cows are bad. But I think in this case  
**[0:43:41-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:43:41):**  there's a lot of nuance because  If we let if we let the eastern red cedars take over the plains, which they're winning the war  They're winning right now for sure. We're not even making a dent in it right now  
**[0:43:55-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:43:55):**  But if we let the cedars win  It's going to continue to desertify  Get dry get dusty  
**[0:44:03-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:44:03):**  and erode and  It's also like the destruction of you know, major economic activity, right?  You know, and it's not just it's it's destroying  
**[0:44:14-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:44:14):**  The production it's not just taking away from the production of the land, you know by the trees taken taking moisture taking  Land space area and reducing the overall health and productivity  You know, it's it's also reducing habitat for a lot of other wildlife  
**[0:44:29-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:44:29):**  And then you just let's just even think about human health  So allergy and asthma with cedar pollen  30 30 years ago  
**[0:44:40-0:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:44:40):**  Here in oklahoma, we had a lot of  years ago here in oklahoma, we would get we'd have you know, typical south winds prevailing winds, especially starting in about december  Redberry juniper in texas would start to pollinate man. We'd get up there people, you know  
**[0:44:54-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:44:54):**  You'd you'd start to feel allergies go all the way into march because again, you'd have redberry juniper then you get  Blueberry juniper and then you get eastern red cedar all pollinating and man  That's problem and a lot of times used to be when we get a north wind it would clean the air out  
**[0:45:09-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:45:09):**  Well now kansas got so much cedar now you can't seriously you just you don't when the wind blows from the north  It's cedar. It's pollen coming from kansas and nebraska from the south. We got texas, oklahoma  And so again, but you look at human health issues of allergy and asthma issues, you know  
**[0:45:25-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:45:25):**  Most people get asked it starting in about december going all the way to march  I guarantee you most people have problems with allergies and you look at it cedar pollen  So again, that's a big that's a big health issue within that. Uh, you look at  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:45:40):**  wildfire issues, you know again  volatility of fuel  Granted, you know  
**[0:45:46-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:45:46):**  Cedars can make a great fire break if they're wet, you know, they're not going to burn, you know  Got leaf moisture the fire will go out when it hits a solid stand of cedar because there's nothing underneath there to burn  It's too wet. The leaves are too  
**[0:45:58-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:45:58):**  Too wet that you know, they're not going to burn  But get it dry drowsy conditions, especially like we're in right now, man. It's just cranky big-time fire and you're not going to stop it  And so you're putting people at risk fighting the fire  
**[0:46:12-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:46:12):**  At that risk your risk, you know homeowners landowners are at greater risk because you have greater fire intensities greater problems  That can happen  Especially in urban areas that allow that to grow up along those edges and stuff, you know  
**[0:46:26-0:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:46:26):**  You know, there's all kinds it doesn't you know that issue doesn't you know?  And I think that's what we definitely got to work on that that issue definitely impacts that that single that landowner  And actually those around you because again just like you if you're if you're concentrating and you're working on your ranch  
**[0:46:44-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:46:44):**  To keep it cedar free or to keep it best that we can but my neighbors aren't doing anything at all  It makes my life difficult don't it because i've still got a seed source. I've still got all that stuff  Still trying to pound and come in here, you know, so again, we all got to work together to eliminate an issue  
**[0:47:02-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:47:02):**  But you know you you work on that you work trying to get that done and that cedar issue  You know just keeps growing but again, so we got to work to pull that away from community  So again, not only does it impact you as an individual  
**[0:47:17-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:47:17):**  It starts to impact the community also impact a region also impact  A large region like the whole entire great plains because again, we've got  We've got cedar issues from texas all the way to north dakota now, you know, and again 30 years ago  
**[0:47:31-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:47:31):**  We did you know south dakota and north dakota would laugh at you like yeah, we don't have a lot actually I was in kansas  You know 20 plus years ago and people were oh, we don't have a cedar problem here and more  Really? You haven't looked because you know, it's always the same thing  
**[0:47:46-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:47:46):**  You know, we're on the same piece of ground  We see the same piece of ground year in and year out  And we don't notice those subtle changes, you know kind of a lot of times it's just like whenever you're a kid and  
**[0:48:00-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:00):**  As you're getting older you look at people and go  Oh, they're not very old and all of a sudden one day you look at them. It's like golly  They've really aged and it's they didn't age overnight. They just take it's a process and doing that same thing  
**[0:48:13-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:13):**  You know that woody plants  You know invasion didn't happen overnight. And again, you know, we're not going to change it overnight either  It's it's going to we got to get to work on it  
**[0:48:23-0:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:23):**  Because it's it's been years coming and it's going to be years for us to get it back  But we've got to work on it and get and you know and get after it  Yeah, I don't have gray in my beard. It's just like it didn't suddenly show up. It's just been kind of you know  
**[0:48:37-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:37):**  Yeah, I get that  You look at yourself in the mirror every day. That's not great. It's chrome. Yes. It's just face chrome. You're chroming up there  Quick question  
**[0:48:49-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:49):**  Yeah  What's your favorite kind of drip torch forestry supplier or panama?  Forestry supply I hate panama torches. I go the other way  
**[0:48:58-0:49:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:48:58):**  Yeah, no, you're from up there. You're from north. Yeah  That line you go up there and get to nebraska. My buddies in nebraska. We argue about this all the time  I give them a hard time about it, but they're they're big panama guys. I've always liked my i've always liked my  
**[0:49:12-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:49:12):**  Normal drip torches forestry suppliers, whatever you want to call them  Uh, I can sling fire with them long ways do a lot of stuff. I just like the way they they work. Uh,  That's it's a chevy and ford question in it. Yeah, pretty much pretty much  
**[0:49:29-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:49:29):**  Yeah  I just I don't like the I don't like the two-piece lid with the spout on it  I like having the I like having the spout over on the other side. That's yeah, it's personal preference  
**[0:49:38-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:49:38):**  I just wanted to know it is i've and i've used them both and uh, you know, I can use them  But I just just like my regular torches  Feeling that so you get to play with a terra torch sometimes too though, don't you?  
**[0:49:50-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:49:50):**  Uh, we've got one we don't use a whole lot man. Those things are just a pain to clean up  You know once you use it, you need to use it. You need to use it a lot to make it kind of work wild  Under that i'm, you know, i've actually got to burn with heli torches. I burned with helicopters and i've used ignition with dates  
**[0:50:07-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:50:07):**  You know ping pong ball machines. I've been involved with some of that. Uh,  I've used you know  propane  
**[0:50:15-0:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:50:15):**  I've burned with  All kinds of different stuff used a fire rake. I remember setting over a half mile of backfire with a fire rake one day  you know  
**[0:50:26-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:50:26):**  Getting grass in the teeth and keeping it lit and just dragging it along and you know  Kind of the old-fashioned way of doing that kind of stuff. So  kind of like  
**[0:50:36-0:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:50:36):**  You know what? I always remember people tell me  Oh  We we use a tire behind a four-wheel we'll soak it in diesel and light the tire off and hook it to a chain  
**[0:50:44-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:50:44):**  And drag it behind a four-wheel. I've never done that one yet. So  I haven't either it just seems that seems really really safe. That's that. Yeah, that sounds redneck as you can get right there  the other one that i've never done and probably have no desire to do would be  
**[0:51:00-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:51:00):**  Like there's there's guys that would take it a pipe  Yeah, and tie the back of it up on a four-wheeler  And let the other end of it down on the ground just have a little hole drilled in it  
**[0:51:10-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:51:10):**  Yeah, and maybe a little wick and they're driving around on their forward with this pipe full of fuel just dripping fire behind them  I like my drip torch. I can put that out. Yeah. Yeah, that's what that's, you know, it's really erison's, you know  I've helped a lot of people get started burning and trained with that and a lot of people's never seen a drip torch  
**[0:51:28-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:51:28):**  You know, they've used it, you know, even just the handheld propane torch, you know  Trying to the light and do that and you give them a drip torch, you know, no matter what brand it is  And you don't use it and they're like, wow, this is really nice to be able to to do that and uh, and to have that  
**[0:51:45-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:51:45):**  Here's here's one for you question for you  Is that I can tell them myself big time?  So how many times have you ever been on a fire?  
**[0:51:54-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:51:54):**  Get ready to start a fire and you don't have anything to start the fire with  No matches no lighter  That has actually not happened to my group I  
**[0:52:07-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:52:07):**  I  Since I've been doing this so long like I and I used to smoke cigarettes  I just got in the habit of carrying a lighter. Yeah, and I haven't smoked in years  
**[0:52:19-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:52:19):**  There's a BIC lighter in my pocket and there's probably a half a dozen of them laying around in my office  You never know when you're going to need a BIC lighter. That's right  I've got I always carry one but again early on in my stuff  
**[0:52:30-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:52:30):**  I would not carry one as often and do that, you know, and you got got where people didn't smoke, you know  You know, so everybody's doing that  Yeah, that's the greatest thing, you know  
**[0:52:40-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:52:40):**  You write a good burn plan you get everything planned out the weather's good you get everybody there and you get all the equipment  there and you get out to the site  and  
**[0:52:48-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:52:48):**  Let's light this fire and it's like  Guys 10 side by sides a half a dozen trucks. Nobody has anything to light the fire with that's really what I like to do  That's really great. That's embarrassing as I'll get out. So  
**[0:53:03-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:53:03):**  One time what I had to do  I mean we it wasn't like we could run back to somewhere and get some  I took a page of the fire plan rolled it up back in the day when you actually had cigarette lighters and vehicles  
**[0:53:14-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:53:14):**  push that in stuck in it stuck the  Piece of paper in the on the lighter and then fanned it. I got it to light and I used my fire plan to light  The fire with so that's it. You got to do what you got to do every now and then whenever especially when you make stupid mistakes  
**[0:53:27-0:53:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:53:27):**  So i've never had to take one of my burn plants and light it on fire to start a fire  That's one thing i've never had to do well I got you beat on that one i'll let you have that one there we go  You had any bad wrecks like not wrecks you had any bad uh getaways bad escapes, uh, you know, I've burned  
**[0:53:53-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:53:53):**  I'm, almost at 1400 burns that i've done in the last 35 years  uh, i've had three escape fires and my escapes I mean that is  Fires where I have to call other people to help me put it out. So call the fire department do that  
**[0:54:09-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:54:09):**  It's not out of control until it leaves your property  Well, even if even if it does spot over on the other property I can get it out with you know  That's a spot fire to me. That's uh,  
**[0:54:19-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:54:19):**  You know, that's a spot fire spotted. We were able to suppress it with equipment people on site get it done. That's good  You know those fires where you got to call for help. It's getting bigger and out of control more than that  I've had about three of those  
**[0:54:36-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:54:36):**  You know nothing  Again, even of those actually one of them I called the fire department  We actually had it out by the time the fire department got there and as soon as the fire department got there their  
**[0:54:47-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:54:47):**  transmission on their truck went out anyway, and so we had to help them haul it back into town  kind of deal with the other ones, you know, maybe  You know got out burned about 120 acres over on some neighboring properties and stuff, but no, you know, no  
**[0:55:05-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:55:05):**  No damages, you know, no insurance claims. No anything like that and all the  the burns and years that i've been burning and things like that, but you know  I was talking to somebody else and we were talking about spot fires and escapes the other day actually, um on that  
**[0:55:21-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:55:21):**  And you know it  If you burn long enough, you know things, you know, you're always going to have spot fires  You know that that's just that's part of burning and you know, it's kind of like riding a horse, you know  
**[0:55:30-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:55:30):**  If you don't fall off every now and then you just you haven't rode enough miles  You know because your things are going to happen same thing with burning you're going to have some spots  You know how to you know, typically you learn when they're going to happen and you're looking for one  
**[0:55:44-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:55:44):**  And when it does happen, you're right there on it and they typically don't get very big and no problems  And things like that  We always talk about but with escape fires typically always seems like it's a big  
**[0:55:58-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:55:58):**  it's always a compounding problem that happens and that's and the ones that i've had are the exact same way is  The fire will you find the fires out and then all of a sudden?  A piece of equipment breaks down, you know, or it gets stuck on the way there  
**[0:56:15-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:56:15):**  You know or they drag the hose and it pulls the nozzle, you know, just all kinds of goofy things  You know run they run over the hose had one one time it wasn't it wasn't an escape but it was getting close to it  The guy was had stretched the hose out and was spraying water down next thing  
**[0:56:32-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:56:32):**  You know looked over he'd laid it in a really hot area with a bunch of coals there  burnt the hose into and so all of a sudden that piece of equipment was rendered useless pretty much  You know, we had we had one, you know again the same thing where  
**[0:56:48-0:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:56:48):**  On the way one of the vehicles just quit working for all of a sudden it wouldn't work  You know, so so that broke down and then all of a sudden you get there and then you're you have less water than you think  In one of the trucks and all of a sudden you run out of water, you know  
**[0:57:02-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:57:02):**  So you got a lot of times it's always that it's these compounding problems that just keep compounding and compounding until it's like guy  I gotta have some help here to get something out  Yeah  
**[0:57:16-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:57:16):**  I'm, not gonna say I haven't lost the fire that i've been burned boss on  I'm gonna say that we I mean we have lost fires. Of course. I mean everybody does you do it long enough  You're gonna lose one. You're gonna have to call the volunteers  
**[0:57:28-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:57:28):**  volunteers be embarrassed feel bad  I mean it it sucks having to come  It it really sucks having to call the volunteers come bail you out of a situation  
**[0:57:39-0:57:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:57:39):**  and  You know, we can talk to her blue in the face about how to actually do a burn  And what to do burn day on the ground?  
**[0:57:48-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:57:48):**  But I think you and I can agree that 90 percent of it is days before the burn sitting in here in the office  Looking at the map making the plan making your contingencies identifying  you know areas in preparation that are weak that you're going to need units at because  
**[0:58:06-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:58:06):**  When the fire comes here at 11 o'clock  There's going to be enough lift. We need to be 500 yards down downwind to catch the spot fire. That's going to happen  That's going to happen  
**[0:58:17-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:58:17):**  That's right, you know, and that's that's the deal, you know  You know, I burn everything I burn I burn it in my head long before it ever gets burned  You know, I think I think through it. I've always done that, you know, we're always  
**[0:58:30-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:58:30):**  I picture how it's going to burn and the other thing I do  You know tell people because a lot of times  You know when you go out and you walk or you drive around your burn units, you know getting ready to you know  
**[0:58:42-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:58:42):**  Plan it how you're going to burn it do whatever everybody's always looking inside the burn unit  I actually probably spend more time looking outside my burn unit to what's around it  And that helps me dictate a lot because again if I look out here and say all right. Oh over here  
**[0:58:59-0:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:58:59):**  I've got a neighbor over here that doesn't graze and he's got grass, you know  Hip high to elephant out there. It's like man  I really don't want to send a fire that way because if there's a spot gets over in there  
**[0:59:11-0:59:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:59:11):**  And it's gonna be hard to ever get that thing out or they got an area where they they've cut all these cedar  And they're just laying everywhere and they haven't done anything with it. It's like golly if it gets in there where  It'll take six weeks to mop it up if we can ever even get it out  
**[0:59:26-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:59:26):**  And so I want to send fire if I can if I can send my smoke this way  I want to send it away from that or if I got a neighbor  That grubs it down to the ground, you know  
**[0:59:36-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:59:36):**  Like yeah, i'm gonna send my fire that way because if this spot's over there, it ain't going anywhere or you know  No big deal kind of deal. So I look a lot outside the burn unit as to what's around me  You know not only for smoke as a big part of it  
**[0:59:51-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=0:59:51):**  But also for my fire which way I want to send it to make it safer and easier  You also look at fire breaks that I may have, you know, I may I may have over here  I can use a county road, you know, so I got a bare ground county road over here on two sides  
**[1:00:05-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:05):**  I really want to send it that way. You know traffic's not going to be a problem  Smoke in that way. It's no big deal because it's just a dirt county road  But i've got  
**[1:00:14-1:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:14):**  You know, I got 30 foot of bare ground fire break over here  It'd be a whole lot easier to backfire off of this than it will over here where i've got  You know, i'm gonna have to put in a fire break or do something like that, you know  
**[1:00:26-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:26):**  Or or have to work off a mowed line and stuff. I'd rather work off of that bare ground road that's already there  It's a thousand percent easier to burn off of a two-track road than it is to build a fire guard to go down fence lines  and that's one of the  
**[1:00:40-1:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:40):**  One of the things that we really  Are good about doing here in the red hills  I say that but  
**[1:00:47-1:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:47):**  is  you know, we've had a burn association since 2008 and  We really try to promote a lot of burning culture not just in our area  
**[1:00:57-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:00:57):**  We're trying to promote other other burn associations in the state to get started  but the power in that is  You know, we have a group that you know goes and does this a lot. We kind of know each other. Um,  
**[1:01:11-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:01:11):**  Fire culture  Man fire culture is a tricky one, you know, we talked a little bit about the flint hills  They have a very strong fire culture and you know, their burn season is like april 7th to april 15th. It seems like  
**[1:01:25-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:01:25):**  million and a half acres get burned in that week and  Look, I get it. You know that that's that's the business plan  That's what they need to do to make a living make their land payments. I get it  
**[1:01:35-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:01:35):**  I like you know, I like looking at the you know, mid-summer later summer window  It might not always be the most ideal from a grazing planning  Point of view or being able to manage stockpiles  
**[1:01:51-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:01:51):**  But i'm starting to look at that as just another management challenge to overcome  And and just something else to figure out. Yeah  um  
**[1:02:02-1:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:02:02):**  The other thing about like that like seasonality and burning at different seasons  You know, not only doing that makes a lot of times makes burning simpler, you know  I always tell people, you know  
**[1:02:14-1:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:02:14):**  One of my favorite quotes is, you know burning is not rocket science because I am definitely not a rocket scientist. I'm not that smart  And so but it's it's simple it's easier and I think people are scared of it because they think it's  They think it's a lot more difficult. It's a lot more problematic in it and it's not that different as long as you think through  
**[1:02:32-1:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:02:32):**  It's just like anything else the more you're around something the more you get comfortable with it the more doing it  That you more that you do it the more you can do it you do it safely  But you know make it so so again burning stuff in the springtime and then  
**[1:02:47-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:02:47):**  Burning into those burned areas in the summer and it makes life simple because it's that fire is not going to go across those areas  You burned in the spring. There's no old growth to carry it so you can do that and then burning stuff in the summer  You go turn around and burn it in the spring granted. Yeah, it you burn it in the summer  
**[1:03:05-1:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:03:05):**  There's enough fuel, you know, there's enough grass regrew and things like that. It will burn  But you're dealing with really short stature fuel  Simple and easy to put stuff out, you know, so again, you know build on your burns and do things makes life simple and safer  
**[1:03:21-1:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:03:21):**  You know, that's that's a big part of that too is how do you make it?  How do you make the burn safe simple and easy because it really shouldn't be a lot of hard work out there  You know, it should be it should be enjoyable, you know, really burn is fun. It is fun  
**[1:03:36-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:03:36):**  And you know and you can make it a you can make it sometimes people make it really difficult  It shouldn't be difficult  But like you said with the group you burn with the more you burn with a group man the greater  
**[1:03:47-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:03:47):**  Yes, because everybody knows their job. Everybody knows what they're supposed to do what they're looking for man  It's fun to have a great burn crew to burn with it's that is one thing that is so much so enjoyable  Is to have good burn crews to you know, you don't worry about anything, you know, you know, you know  
**[1:04:03-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:04:03):**  If I sent you down the line over here lighting, you know where to go, you know how to light you're we're not gonna worry about it  You're not gonna send you know create too big a head fire or anything like that, you know  Whatever we need to do, you know, you're gonna it's gonna be done, right?  
**[1:04:17-1:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:04:17):**  Sometimes you put the guy on the torts that doesn't know how to stop and sometimes you put the guy on the torch that goes really slow and really careful  It depends on the day. That's for sure. I I spend almost as much time on  Let's just say like line assignments what crews I'm going to put on what line  
**[1:04:36-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:04:36):**  That's almost as critical as like fire guard prep and the planning for wind directions is  Having the right team go down the right line to deal with the hazards that they're going to be presented with.  Yeah, you know, there's that's that's things I always look at is again which side is the most difficult or is the greatest risk and a lot of time I'll be always be on that  
**[1:04:58-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:04:58):**  I've you know, I always put myself over there. I want to be  If I'm in charge, I want to be in charge of the bad side  I don't want to have it easy because I want to know what's going on and be in control of doing that  
**[1:05:08-1:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:05:08):**  Yeah, and so you know who I put where that's always a big thought about that  Like I said, there is there's times to burn whenever you need the slow poke  Person that don't walk real fast  
**[1:05:21-1:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:05:21):**  To be lightened because we need to go slow today  And then there's other times man. We need some speed because we need to get we got great conditions. It's perfect  Let's go and get it done  
**[1:05:30-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:05:30):**  uh, you know, that's  Reminds me of one we did a a couple years ago or my friend  uh on the ranch my friend russell blue runs  
**[1:05:39-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:05:39):**  it was uh  Like we show up and i'm kind of expecting like a 35 3700 acre deal  And he's like, oh no  
**[1:05:47-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:05:47):**  We've expanded and added on a couple extra units  It's 5500 acres. There you go. Like okay, what's my piece? And he said you're gonna be east boss and line boss  And here's the map and I looked at it. I go  
**[1:06:02-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:06:02):**  Dude that is like eight miles here we got to cover and he said  Yeah  So I looked at it a little bit more and made some quick crew assignments and we went and briefed it and the last thing  
**[1:06:13-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:06:13):**  I said at the brief is guys we got 14 miles to get around this monster speed is life. Let's go  And I think it's less than three hours later. We we were around it. Yeah  you know and  
**[1:06:27-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:06:27):**  You're probably the same way. I would rather burn a big unit than a big one  I would rather burn a big unit than I had a little one. Oh, yeah  It takes all day. It doesn't matter. It takes all day. Yeah, I always tell people, you know burnings like camping  
**[1:06:41-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:06:41):**  You know, it don't matter if you go camping for three days or three weeks  You still got to take the same amount of junk  The only thing you the only thing you got to bring is more food  
**[1:06:51-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:06:51):**  Yeah, and burn is the same way. It don't matter if you're burning three acres or three thousand acres  It takes the same amount of equipment. You just got to bring more torch fuel  Uh, you know and that's that's the deal with you know, so you might as well  
**[1:07:02-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:07:02):**  Big burn units are way more forgiving. You know, I spent a lot of time burning a lot of small stuff  You know, that's what's risky. I'm burning this little bitty chunk inside this big chunk  You know, I remember burning some uh research plots up in northwest, Oklahoma  
**[1:07:18-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:07:18):**  We were doing some work on they were like seven ten acre research plots. We're in the middle of a  In the middle of a two thousand acre pasture burning seven acres  In  
**[1:07:31-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:07:31):**  grass and sand sagebrush waist high  And i'm looking around going. Yeah, this thing gets out. We're having fun  Uh, you know and it unfortunately it didn't uh, but it's like holy smokes, you know  
**[1:07:44-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:07:44):**  I'd rather i'd rather burn the two thousand than I had that seven. I had to burn in the middle of it, you know  Yeah, and I was I was trying to go this direction earlier when I was talking about, uh prescribed fire associations  You know and back to my comment that yeah, it's a lot easier. I'd much rather burn off of even just a two-track road  
**[1:08:04-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:08:04):**  Than a fence line. So we have a tendency to put fence lines  On our property line like my god, it's got to be right on the line  and  
**[1:08:13-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:08:13):**  a lot of times it's really  Unpractical to try to get down that fence line and if you try to stay just on your property  You might have to box around some canyons that really really need fire  
**[1:08:25-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:08:25):**  To get in there just for access. So one of the great things about our burn association  is  Uh, you know, we have uh, we have several state prescribed fire coordinators like funded positions  
**[1:08:38-1:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:08:38):**  Yeah, ours is jess crockford. I know you know it. Oh man. Jess is so  so great  Like his actual job title escapes me right now  
**[1:08:47-1:08:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:08:47):**  But he he goes around and he helps people set up burn associations and write burn plans  And he'll even show up on the get on the day of your fire and run a torch for you  And let me tell you jess is a lead igniter  
**[1:09:00-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:09:00):**  Life is good. Yeah, he's on the eight. Yeah  I could go  I got to burn with jess back in september. I come up and did a  
**[1:09:08-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:09:08):**  Uh burn training for the nrcs there in kansas and we were outside pretty prairie over where dusty  And that area and jess come over and helped us every day that we burned and they had so much fun working with jess and  Doing that. He's one of them ones, you know exactly right man a great crew member, you know, if you send him over there  
**[1:09:29-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:09:29):**  Things are going to get done. They're going to get done, right? They're going to get done safe and doing that  It's it's good to have you know, good folks like that  But like I said the burn association part man makes it different and makes it great  
**[1:09:40-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:09:40):**  And like you said you start, you know, you got those boundaries and that's what we're always worried about with fires  You know that fire getting off of your property, you know, so I always say, you know fences are the biggest determinant of fire  Because we always don't want it to burn through the fence not because it's not going to damage the fence  
**[1:09:59-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:09:59):**  It's because we're worried about it getting across that property line. Yeah  And if we take away those fences  Those property boundaries fire is able to function across the land like it should and that's where burn associations  
**[1:10:14-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:10:14):**  That's where that fire culture again. That's why the flint hills of kansas, you know, o'sage  Country in oklahoma why they burn so much and they're able to do that  There's no boundaries fire. No, no, no, no boundaries up there because everybody  
**[1:10:30-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:10:30):**  Burns expects to burn and it does that and that's why you know fire can function on that landscape  And that's where you know  We've lost it because we got these boundaries and we don't want fire to get off of our property on the next  
**[1:10:43-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:10:43):**  But if we get together with neighbors form that burn association start that fire culture  You're right. It's a whole lot easier to burn from this lease road or two-track road on my place  To the county road lease road  
**[1:10:56-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:10:56):**  Creek whatever on the neighbor  Over here, we ain't going to try to put a fire break in this big old canyon and trying to deal with all that  Let's just burn the whole thing out. We can go from point a to point b and  
**[1:11:08-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:11:08):**  Life is good be done before lunch  That's right and be done and be done instead of working all week on this thing and babysitting it and all that  You know if we just kept it on our place  
**[1:11:19-1:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:11:19):**  And doing it that's the that's the great  Process of what burn associations should be is it gets neighbors talking about  Fire and using fire because how many times you know when probably when y'all started using fire, you know  
**[1:11:31-1:11:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:11:31):**  You were one of the few folks out there that were burning  And you know you had the naysayers and the negative people that were neighbors and doing that but you also had other neighbors going  Well, why didn't you let it come across the fence? I'd like to burn my place, too  
**[1:11:45-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:11:45):**  We don't have a plan and we don't have a break  But a lot more than often than not if most time if neighbors will talk to their neighbor you got to talk  You know amazing what communication does you know talk to them and say hey i'm planning on burning this. What do you think about that?  
**[1:11:59-1:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:11:59):**  Well, i'd like to burn too. Okay, let's make a plan and make it simpler we can go  Whole road to whole roads, you know  Great example that was this last spring where I live at live on this on this section I live on  
**[1:12:14-1:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:12:14):**  There's four landowners on four quarters there and one of the neighbors called me said hey i'm going to burn today  And I said, oh, okay, and i'll be glad to help and so we started working  I said i've talked to all the neighbors. They want to burn. Have you talked to them? No, not really  
**[1:12:28-1:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:12:28):**  I said well, let's call but all of a sudden I look up and another neighbor over there had started a fire  It's like hey, hold on a minute. Let's let's all get together and do that before you know it in about 10 minutes  We made a plan and we burnt the whole section, you know, we just went around the roads  
**[1:12:43-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:12:43):**  rung it out and life was good instead of trying to burn this quarter here and this  You know make life simple, you know make fire simple  Can do that. Yeah, one of the things that we've had a problem with is like and this was decades ago  
**[1:12:58-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:12:58):**  Dad would burn a piece  And the neighbors would be like no no, no, we don't want to burn with you. We don't want to burn with you  We don't want to burn with you  
**[1:13:04-1:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:13:04):**  So dad had burned a piece and then two or three days later  They light their pasture and burn through our fence into our fire cars. Yeah, that's right. Yep  Yep, so come on, let's let's let's do it together. It makes it simpler. It makes it cheaper, you know and everything else  
**[1:13:21-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:13:21):**  You know  So I apologize, uh, I do have to get going this morning. So we're gonna have to cut this a little bit short  If folks want to know more about  
**[1:13:32-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:13:32):**  How to start a burn association or some resources?  Where could they go and where can people find you?  On social media, uh, I'm you know, just john weir  
**[1:13:45-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:13:45):**  J-o-h-n-w-e-i-r and so facebook. Uh, i've got just my own personal facebook, but I publish all  Post a lot of fire stuff the things that we can do also if you look up oklahoma state natural resource  Extension we've got a great facebook page there with some great folks that put a lot of good posts out  
**[1:14:05-1:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:14:05):**  A lot of good stuff out there  A lot of good posts out a lot of them are about fire  But all it's all about natural resource about land management things that we can do  
**[1:14:15-1:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:14:15):**  Uh within that for burn association information, uh, the oklahoma prescribed burn association our website, which is ok-pba.org  We have information about starting a burn association we've got  information we've got actually bylaws, you know copies of bylaws and different  
**[1:14:35-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:14:35):**  Documents that other burn associations have used that are already there that you can look at you use help to form one  Um, you know again, like I said depending on what state you're in  There's you know, there's always a lot of people out there that can help  
**[1:14:49-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:14:49):**  Within that, you know, like I said, kansas has got some great folks working in their  kansas burn association  The folks up in nebraska. There's some great great stuff. Texas has some great resources and stuff as well as oklahoma  
**[1:15:02-1:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:15:02):**  So it depends on where you're at. There's some uh, there's resources out there to to help with that  Uh, we've got a bunch of good fact sheets if you'll look up oklahoma state extension  Uh, it'll take you to the oklahoma state  
**[1:15:17-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:15:17):**  Cooperative extension page and then you can do a search on fact sheets just type in fire and you know  We've got all of our different fire fact sheets and stuff that we worked on  I got a fact sheet about starting a burn association even within that but also other great  
**[1:15:30-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:15:30):**  Fact sheets about all kinds of different stuff about growing season fire, you know fire equipment fire planning things like that  So doing that so there's a lot of a lot of information out there about  Very cool very cool. I'll make sure I get as much of that stuff crammed into the show notes as I can  
**[1:15:50-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:15:50):**  and  Like I don't even think we scratched the surface today of  Of talking about fire. Yeah. No, you never can't so  
**[1:15:58-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/92-John-Weir-Dr-Fire-e1rblue#t=1:15:58):**  We need we need to do this again for me or sometime. We'll do it again when you get a chance. So  For sure  well, I really appreciate your time today john and uh

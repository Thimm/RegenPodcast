**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:03):**  A fellow ag podcaster proposed a friendly little competition, but I can't share any  more details than that till the very end.

Settle in and enjoy an epic ride with Bob Kinford.  So Bob, great to talk to you again.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:26):**  Welcome to the show.  It's great to have you today.  How are you doing down there?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:30):**  Well, we actually got some moisture this week and I was able to go get stuck.  So if I can get stuck, it should grow something.  You got stuck.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:41):**  That's a good experience for you down there.  Texas, isn't it?  Well, almost.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:45):**  I mean, it's, you know, if you drive across and you've got a bunch of rabbit holes or  something in the sand, yeah, you can get stuck.  But normally you don't have to worry about getting stuck, but I went ahead and fed the  
**[0:01:58-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:01:58):**  few cows I've got yesterday and went driving off and it just swallowed my truck.  You probably don't even have carry chains or really have much of a way to get yourself  out, do you?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:02:10):**  Oh, I didn't.  I didn't carry change when I was in Montana.  I kept it four wheeled.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:02:17):**  I've actually only been stuck about a half dozen times in my life, but when I do get  stuck, I'm stinking stuck.  I was right down on the spare tire.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:02:28):**  And it wasn't because I was trying, it just, the bottom fell out from underneath it.  So I think my impact was good enough to where any place where there was a puddle, it was  a lot bigger underground than it was on top of the ground.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:02:45):**  Well, you know, I'm really excited to hear about what happens now that you've got some  moisture because how long has it been since you've had any significant rain at all?  A year.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:02:58):**  Wow.  I mean, Saturday night before it started, I had one part of one quarter section.  When I was up in Kansas with you and Josh and everybody, there was a storm went across,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:03:18):**  one center pivot at a diagonal.  So the whole stinking pivot didn't even get it, got an inch.  And that was the first rain that was over two tenths since last July.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:03:32):**  And then the rest of the place, it's like, you know, I've got, it's only 3500 acres and  I've got the one gauge on the northwest corner.  And then the other one is kind of in the south middle, more or less, but down by the house.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:03:48):**  And that one had never had more than a tenth in it since last July.  And how much rain did you get last weekend, you said?  Oh, I have to total it up.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:04:04):**  We got two tenths on Sunday night, or Saturday night, and then got another two tenths Sunday  night.  And then between Monday afternoon and Tuesday night, we got an inch, solid inch across the  
**[0:04:24-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:04:24):**  whole place.  Which is unusual.  Inch and a half of rain is worth taking.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:04:33):**  Well, no, yeah, yeah, basically, it was an inch and a half over four days.  So yeah, that's worth taking.  And as far as I can tell, I don't think I had much runoff at all, if any, which is unheard  
**[0:04:45-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:04:45):**  of for down here in an area where you usually have runoff on less than a quarter inch rain,  people start running water.  And that was a one inch rain the other night.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:05:00):**  I mean, other than on the roads themselves, there was not really any puddles.  I'm really interested to talk to you again in a couple of months toward the end of the  growing season and see what kind of forage this rains drone.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:05:14):**  Oh, yeah, it's gonna be interesting.  I've already got a bunch of little tumbleweeds and looks like maybe a little pigweed coming  up.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:05:24):**  And it's just today's worst day is actually warmed up enough for it to do anything.  So it'll be interesting to even see what it looks like by the end of next week.  But the older cows that I got when I made that trip up there and figuring they're just  
**[0:05:41-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:05:41):**  gonna be able to last through the end of last month on the the mesquite beans.  Well, those mesquite beans actually turned when I was gone to where they're just going  right straight through the cows.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:05:56):**  They kind of drop down because a bunch of them were calving and they calved.  You know how that goes when there's not much feed and they calve, they just kind of crater.  So I'm starting feeding them a little bit and we're going to ship them out on the 14th.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:06:10):**  I'm going to let stuff grow and then see if I can't get a thousand head of yearlings in  around September 1st to October and run them for about, probably run them for about four  or five months to be able to do everything.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:06:27):**  Okay.  Because that's been really pretty dense on the weeds.  So how are your cows doing?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:06:32):**  Are they holding together better or?  Oh yeah, yeah we've been through a couple small paddocks and this morning, it's going  to be a couple weeks before I release this.  
**[0:06:42-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:06:42):**  So this morning we moved them into, it was 130 acres, like 130, 135, something like that.  And I decided I wanted to saw off part of it because 250 cows in 130 acres, that's probably  10, 12 days worth of feed in there, but I didn't want them in there that long because  
**[0:07:04-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:04):**  after about five days you're going to get some regrowth.  Anyway terrain topography.  This would be an interesting time to experiment with that.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:14):**  Oh yeah, but anyway, so I just saw it off 40 acres and they're in 90.  And it's about 90, 92 acres left in there.  And they're doing a pretty good job of staying together in a group, but I did notice after  
**[0:07:29-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:29):**  we turned them in today to the fresh paddock, they did make a lap of the whole thing and  they got really strung out.  And I'm not sure I always really liked that behavior where when you turn them in, they  
**[0:07:42-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:42):**  make a whole lap around the paddock.  Yeah, normally they don't.  That's kind of a sign that for some reason they were unsatisfied.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:51):**  They might've been.  You know what I mean?  The last paddock they were in, they were in, they should have been out of there in the  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:07:59):**  morning.  They should have been out of there in the morning instead of early afternoon because,  oh, well, I had a fun morning.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:05):**  I was getting my coffee and trying to get ready to get out of the house and I got a  phone call.  Hey, you got some cows out on the highway.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:14):**  Okay.  Appreciate that call.  In the next three minutes, I got four more phone calls with the same message.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:23):**  So yeah, I get out there and they packed up at a gate that I should have fixed five years  ago and blown out and they were on the highway.  I had over a hundred out on the highway grazing up and down the ditches.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:35):**  They were strung out for a half a mile.  It was just a wonderful, wonderful way to start the day.  Let me tell you.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:41):**  Well, yeah, at least they were working cows and they weren't chasing water lines or something.  Well, yeah, but this is a group I haven't really worked with very much.  I've only had these for about two weeks.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:08:55):**  Oh, okay.  Well, that gives you really good practice.  Unfortunately, just right after I got on scene, I had a neighbor show up with a feed truck  
**[0:09:07-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:07):**  and I'd already stopped him from going east and he kind of watched that east side and  I went all the way to the west end and brought them all up on foot with my side by side and  we got them all up there in a group.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:21):**  He flipped his siren on and bailed into the pasture and I all followed him right in there  and he dribbled out just a little bit of feed and they were happy and he snuck back out.  Then I got to fix a gate that I should have fixed five years ago.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:34):**  You know.  You never do anything like that.  You never do that, do you Bob?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:39):**  What?  I said you never do that, do you?  You look at it and go, well, that'll keep working until it doesn't.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:46):**  You know what my brand is.  What is that again?  Number two, a lazy four you.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:09:58):**  Yeah, I dig it.  I dig it.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:03):**  So yeah, I had a whole day all the way back and it wasn't bad.  Nothing got hit.  We got everything off the highway and no drama.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:14):**  Well, I'd say it breaks up the day.  That's what I like about ranching is you never, you can think you know what you're going to  do, but then that can change before you get there.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:25):**  It only takes one phone call to screw up your whole day.  And it's just that one phone call.  Yeah, but it didn't really screw up your whole day.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:35):**  I mean, it kind of changed things around a little bit.  You had to readjust, but how much did it really screw it up?  Oh, not really.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:44):**  Nobody died.  I mean, nobody died.  You didn't have any, what did you have that you were going to do today that was really  
**[0:10:51-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:10:51):**  all that urgently important?  Well, moved my hungry cows out of a paddock that they should have, that they needed to  be moved out of first thing in the morning.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah, but how long did it take to move them out?  Ten minutes.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:07):**  So it's like your big important thing you absolutely had to do was only a ten minute  job.  So you needed something to keep you busy.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:17):**  Yeah, I need something to keep me on my toes every once in a while.  That's why I have friends like you, Bob, because you keep me on my toes.  You have a friend like me crying?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:25):**  You got to keep your sense of humor on it.  I mean, and it's all part of it, right?  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:42):**  Exactly.  It's like I tell people, it isn't that you had a wreck.  It isn't that it was even a big wreck.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:51):**  It's how you recover from it.  Yeah, we got along the highway.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:11:58):**  And a lot of times those wrecks are fun to put back together.  So it gives you good practice on your stockmanship and you got something a little bit different  to do.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:12:10):**  So I mean, why sweat that?  I'm not sweating it.  I'm laughing about it.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:12:15):**  I'm laughing about it because it wasn't bad.  This neighbor and I, we've had some Hatfield McCoy bullshit in the past and it felt good  to work with him.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:12:33):**  He showed up to help me without me asking because he knew there was a situation.  Oh, that's a good deal.  He'd gotten a phone call too.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:12:43):**  So everybody got a phone call.  Yeah, he didn't have to.  He showed up, he helped me out.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:12:49):**  Well, he showed up and he didn't go, oh, they're not my cows and leave.  Yeah, I mean.  Well, that was a good thing.

Well, you actually got along once, which is a good thing.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:13:12):**  Yeah, it felt pretty good to shake his hand and made sure he knew that his help was much  appreciated.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:13:19):**  Yeah, that's a lot better than, you know, wondering if you're going to get shot over  the fence.  I've lost my ability with those situations.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:13:33):**  Let's just move right on.  So we're talking about stockmanship and you're really known for your stockmanship and you're  very outspoken, probably not all of my listeners are familiar with what we're talking about.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:13:51):**  And so what's the 30,000 foot view of your style of stockmanship?  30,000 foot view?  Too lazy for you?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:14:06):**  I don't know if you want to say a high flow, low pressure or high pressure, high flow.  I mean, you know, you were up at YNW with Josh and Gwen when I had that two day clinic  down there and then, you know, we played around that one morning at your place and it's actually  
**[0:14:31-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:14:31):**  kind of relaxing.  It's low stress, but you put an extreme amount of pressure on cattle for a short amount of  time to create a flow, but it's more like instead of what we think about getting on  
**[0:14:49-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:14:49):**  cattle and putting pressure on them and putting the pressure on them to make them go someplace,  we put the pressure on them to where they can see that the point of release is where  we want them to go.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:15:05):**  To get them to go where you want them to by making them think it's their own good idea.  That's kind of how I have it in my head.  And I think...  
**[0:15:14-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:15:14):**  Basically, I mean, and it keeps changing in my mind because trying to explain how this  works is, you got to kind of see it to even see that it does work because I admit it sounds,  you know, I'm out in left field, two ballparks over for a lot of people.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:15:36):**  It sounds like you're crazy sometimes.  I'll be straight up with you.  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:15:40):**  You said that and it's like people tell me that and it's like, oh, well, if you want  to...  Well, that's why I've gotten out of some Facebook groups.  
**[0:15:46-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:15:46):**  They keep telling me I'm crazy.  And it's like, well, okay, if you can't grasp it, I'm not going to waste my time.  But it's a lot like a potter and you've got a chunk of clay on that potter's wheel.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:02):**  You know, you're not...  It's spinning around.  It's spinning.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:05):**  It's kind of like the mind of a cow.  And you've got to grab a hold of it and put the pressure on it the way you want to get  that piece of the clay to follow the shape that you want.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:16):**  And I think it's important to note that every time you go into the pasture, whether you're  in the feed truck, side by side, on the wheeler, on a horse, you change how those animals are  acting.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:33):**  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  And as soon as you pull into that pasture, and one of them notices you're in there, you  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:40):**  have changed that whole herd's grazing behavior.  Yeah, definitely.  And just the way...  
**[0:16:48-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:48):**  You can get on your horse and ride through, poke around and have them all sit still.  But if you're wanting to move, you can ride through there at some pretty dang crazy angles,  actually.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:16:57):**  You know, when you think back when you were hilltopping on that second day at school.  And I went riding down through there, and it looked like I wasn't doing anything.  And then made a little tiny move down on the one end.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:17:12):**  And as I processed cattle, they kind of wrapped around.  And then everything just kind of started...  Everything just from that started flowing.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:17:21):**  And then I went...  There was cattle sitting off to the side, and I went right directly to them.  And they all wrapped around me and then started going the direction I wanted them to go.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:17:30):**  There was no getting around them and pushing them.  And those were yearlings that were pretty fresh, so it's not like they were broke to  death dental cattle.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:17:40):**  So it works.  Every little...  I mean, just...  
**[0:17:46-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:17:46):**  Okay, when you talk horsemanship, and they talk timing, balance, and feel.  And for anybody that's read Tom Dorrance's book, Through Unity, every once in a while  they'll put in there about the search for places in that book that he will mention that  
**[0:18:07-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:18:07):**  you have to focus on where you're wanting the horse to go.  You got to focus.  But he only mentions timing, balance, and feel, and he doesn't say focus.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:18:18):**  But if you don't have that focus, it's not a three-pronged stool.  It's a four-pronged stool.  And if you don't have the focus, you're not going to be able to accomplish as much as  
**[0:18:30-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:18:30):**  you want to accomplish, no matter how good your timing, balance, and feel is.  And these cows are the same direction.  If your horse is just gawking off into space as you're going by them, they're not going  
**[0:18:43-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:18:43):**  to do anything.  But what happens when I take and I pick that head up, and I get that horse to focus in  on that cow with a little bit of a bend in its body as I'm going by, they pick up and  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:18:56):**  move.  Because you've got that horse's focus working on you.  So you're looking at the cow or the horse is looking at the cow, you're approaching  
**[0:19:04-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:04):**  it from a direction that tells it where you want it to go without putting pressure on  it.  So the pressure is off as soon as it starts going the way you want it to go.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:16):**  Right.  And you know, when it gets lined, when those animals get lined out, and their heads are  pointing the right direction, their ears are forward.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:26):**  You got to be out of the pressure, you got to be pulling all the pressure out of that  situation.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:31):**  And exactly.  If you don't, then you're asking them to do something else that you're not really  wanting to ask them to do.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:41):**  And a lot of it is just so subtle.  It's just so subtle.  It's a subtle move here.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:19:49):**  It's one step here into that flight zone at the right angle at the right time to make  that animal move.  And then it's when it works.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:00):**  It's like that fade turn.  Cow turns and is going to go running back and you turn with it and take that one step  extra and they just shut down and go.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:12):**  Sometimes they don't, so you have to take an extra step or maybe two or three extra  steps off.  But going, you know, focus on the cow, but moving away from it and they turn around and  
**[0:20:23-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:23):**  go back in.  You know, every cow is going to react a little bit different.  So you constantly have to have, you know, either a foot or on a horseback, you've got  
**[0:20:33-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:33):**  to be making that those changes step by step as you're going.  Right.  And that's and it's getting back to that focus.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:44):**  You've got to be focused on what you're doing.  And when a person's first trying to pick this stuff up, you've got to be concentrating on  it because if you don't concentrate on what you're doing, you wind up falling back into  
**[0:20:57-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:20:57):**  your old methods and your old habits.  And so you've got to really kind of concentrate on it until it gets to the point where making  these adjustments are just second nature.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:21:12):**  And once there's some nature, then you can really start having fun with it.  So you know that.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:21:20):**  This isn't anything new, is it?  No, it isn't.  But what is I think what's happened over the eons, I mean, some of it is kind of new.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:21:36):**  And a lot of people that follow the Bud Williams, see, the Stockman ship methods, they don't  all that doesn't work.  You know, that's not what Bud did.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:21:50):**  Well, actually, Bud did more than what he taught.  And when I, you know, I was forced to go to a Bud Williams clinic.  I can't remember a school, there was either 91 or 92.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:22:09):**  And I didn't want to go.  The manager that sent me and his cow boss, they went when I first got there, were actually  worse when they came back from the Bud Williams school.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:22:24):**  So it's like, okay, you know, they were worse when they came, you know, came back from it.  So either the guy is full of it, or they didn't understand it.  And it was a deal where you're either going to go or you're going to get another job.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:22:41):**  So I went.  And I'm sitting there, I understand it, you know, it was just made sense.  But people were asking the same questions over and over and over.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:22:52):**  And at the last day when we broke for lunch, I stayed back and I talked with Bud.  And I asked him about some of this stuff that I was doing.  And he said, Oh, yeah, that works great.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:23:03):**  And I said, Well, do you have another class that you teach that?  He says, no, this is the only class I have.  And I asked him why, and he said, well, it's too advanced to teach.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:23:16):**  And then he pointed out, my boss, and he pointed out a couple of guys that were in the class  that kept asking a lot of questions.  And that was their third time there.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:23:29):**  So it's, that got me to thinking on this and how to teach it.  And it finally dawned on me probably, oh, probably about 12, 13 years ago that it's  not advanced, it's basics.  
**[0:23:51-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:23:51):**  Everything that we do with a cow is basic stockmanship.  You can have basic stockmanship that's really bad, or basic stockmanship that's really good.  And once a person can get their mind wrapped around this, and quit doing their predatory  
**[0:24:09-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:24:09):**  move where you got to get around there and start going back and forth across the back,  it starts falling into place.  And some people, some people really have a talent for it.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:24:21):**  And some people have got a deal that just comes from inside of them.  You know, when Ethan stepped into that bunch of cows when we were just starting to go over  the different approaches, and that was a bunch of soured cows that were farmed down to the  
**[0:24:40-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:24:40):**  point where they're not even a cow anymore.  And they did what you asked them to do.  But when Ethan stepped in there, I mean, that was pretty incredible to watch.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:24:52):**  Those cows, it was almost like they stood at attention.  And that's because he's got something inside of him that is exerting energy that those  cows were understanding.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:25:03):**  That those cows were really, you know what, I just had a thought on that though.  Well, he also works with sheep.  Yeah, but, and this is one thing that is really funny because my first school in Mexico, the  
**[0:25:21-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:25:21):**  guy didn't, he hated anybody going down there and doing schools for a variety of reasons.  But and he didn't speak any English, I don't speak any Spanish.  And by the end of that, we were getting along good.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:25:35):**  And the last day he goes, oh, like goats.  Because there is no difference between the basic instincts and reactions between goats,  sheep, cows, llamas, alpacas, elk, kangaroos, any grazing of rabbits.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:25:55):**  If you can hit it just right, you can do a fade turn on a rabbit and stop it.  And you can actually hurt it around a little bit.  Which is, it's fun to do.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:26:08):**  That's, I mean, it's, I do these things because I'm not all there.  I kind of got to experiment.  But whatever he's giving out is, it's an energy that they're looking at.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:26:25):**  And I'm going to get off tangent here, because there's been a lot of stuff on Facebook about  predators, you know, you know, all this about predators hurting the animals, right?  But anybody who's calved out up north, I know Dan Gooden well, if they're night calving,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:26:42):**  they have watched and seen coyotes going through a night pen and picking up afterbirth.  And there might be one or two cows fighting them over that afterbirth, but they're walking  through looking for that afterbirth.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:26:58):**  And those cows aren't paying a dang bit of attention to them.  No, no.  And you can, funny thing, you can have this week, you know, just this week, in both, in  
**[0:27:11-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:27:11):**  two of the herds that are on the ranch, while I've been out checking cows, there have been  coyotes in the middle of both of those herds of cows this week.  And the cows aren't paying any attention because they're looking for gophers.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:27:25):**  Yeah, the cows don't care.  You know, the calves are just, they're just trucking right through.  And I've got three week old calves.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:27:31):**  I'm not worried.  And the thing is, I've also seen mountain lion and bear go right through the middle  of cows, and they don't even hardly, I mean, they might switch an arrow over towards them  
**[0:27:45-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:27:45):**  or something, but you know, unless you're looking really close, you don't see any reaction  off those cows.  Because they know when they're being hunted.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:27:55):**  Well, that's because the focus isn't there from the predator.  And how does that translate?  How does that translate to stockmanship?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:28:09):**  Well, that translates into these animals aren't being herded by the predators.  You know, they're not, you know, think about it, these predators, they would really like  their game to be easy to catch.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:28:26):**  They don't want them to keep moving.  So why do we think that these predators are driving the animals?  Something something anecdotal.  
**[0:28:42-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:28:42):**  Yellowstone.  You know, Yellowstone, basically, if you can get ahold of old private journals, you know,  and Bass and Fremont Carson and that guys, they would go through Yellowstone or the Indians  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:00):**  were after.  Indians would go there.  Exactly.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:06):**  It was evil ground.  And you know what, they didn't even bother.  They didn't even bother stopping the trap because there wasn't anything in there to  
**[0:29:14-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:14):**  trap.  There was and there was no game animals in there.  This whole thing of Yellowstone being this natural environment, our government put bison  
**[0:29:27-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:27):**  in there.  The elk wound up getting kind of driven up there from pressure from, you know, civilization.  So they made it up into the park.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:36):**  And the first set of bison they put up there died.  And they said, well, they weren't mountain bison.  So they went and they got mountain bison and they put them up there and then they fed them  
**[0:29:44-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:29:44):**  every winter.  And then from everything I gleaned out of this, which it gets hard to find sometimes,  they quit feeding, you know, or they're at least cut back on their feeding program when  
**[0:30:00-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:30:00):**  they released the wolves in there.  So you know, it's like, yeah, the wolves knocked out a bunch, but at the same time, how much  of that was winter killed because they weren't feeding them.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:30:15):**  And it's one of the things that I really, the older I get, the more I realize it.  We observe the extremes and very seldom look at the middle.  You know, yeah.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:30:30):**  Oh, wow.  There was, you know, 15, you know, 10 or 15 million bison going by at once.  It's like, you got to laugh.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:30:39):**  I mean, if you've ever counted even a couple of hundred cows through a gate and then you  figure, well, you're going to get an estimate on a million or 10,000 or whatever bison going  through, you're not going to be anywhere close.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:30:55):**  There's no way to say that.  And then as they're going across, you know, they don't, they basically don't even notice  those herds of 150, 200.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:31:05):**  You know, they just notice them when they come together during breeding season.  And the other thing that really gets me about that is how come there is so little mentioned  about the big herds of elk they had, big herds of antelope, big herds of deer.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:31:29):**  Where's all their habitat gone?  Where's all that habitat gone?  Well, it was all the same habitat.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:31:38):**  Those animals were completely crisscrossing and it's like, oh.  And they were all using the forage differently too.  Yeah.  
**[0:31:48-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:31:48):**  And it was, but they would also be using the same forage depending on what time they went  through.  You know, it's not that the bison just ate the grass and then the antelope milk came  
**[0:32:02-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:32:02):**  through and ate the weeds.  When those weeds were the most nutritious, that's when the bison would eat them.  You know, it's, I had that discussion with my freshman high school biology teacher.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:32:14):**  Well, we have grazing animals and browsing animals and grazing animals prefer grasses  and legumes and browsing animals like deer and elk, they like, you know, acorns and nuts  and scrubs and twigs.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:32:29):**  And it's like, well, if that were really true, then why do you see deer out in alfalfa fields?  And why when those pine cones break open or the acorns start dropping, do those cows quit  eating grass and start going for the acorns and the pine nuts?  
**[0:32:50-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:32:50):**  So I mean, we've kind of educated ourselves into some corners to where we don't think  out of the corner.  I mean, we're not even in the box because the whole box has these animals eating various  
**[0:33:08-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:33:08):**  things.  But we paint the grazers into this box and the browsers into, or into this corner of  the box and the browsers into another.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:33:20):**  So we need to, I think we really need to start having a lot of different research done on  what these animals will eat.  And also, you know, because that's one of the things of doing IMG, once you get herd  
**[0:33:39-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:33:39):**  instinct rebooted, but some people get so sick and tired of hearing that, they think  they, or our cows stick together.  Well, yeah, you got them in a 20 acre pasture all the time, you know, with the same cows,  
**[0:33:50-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:33:50):**  you know, which are a family group moving around all the time, well, those family groups  are going to stay together.  You know, but you get out like on your place.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:33:59):**  If, you know, normally your cows, when you would turn them in there, they kind of scatter  out across there.  Now they're kind of running together and you're just, you know, you're just getting started  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:34:10):**  with us.  So, yeah,  Yeah, might stick together whenever I move them for a while.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:34:15):**  And they're getting better at it too.  Yeah, and you're not, you're not going and doing like we do at a store where you sit  on that and you concentrate on it for five days and then it's there.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:34:24):**  Oh, it's like an hour or two a day when I go out to, you know, either check them or  move them or, you know, yeah, mineral or whatever.  I mean, you're not going out there, pick them up and kind of making sure they go to water  
**[0:34:37-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:34:37):**  at the same time and then hang around and wait for them to come off water and make sure  they come off with just the changes that you've made in your stockmanship and you're still  doing your same daily routine, they're coming together.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:34:52):**  Now have you noticed any difference in their raising habits as far as what they're eating?  I saw calves eating thistleheads this morning.  Not eating what?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:06):**  Thistles.  Oh, okay.  Eating the heads off the thistles.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:11):**  Yeah.  And that's one of the things that they should be grazing, you know, because that's good  feed, you know, but it's one of those things, oh, we got to spray it, you know.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:23):**  This wasn't a pasture they might take over.  That's good cow feed.  You know, let's, you know, one of the things I have written down to cover with you today  
**[0:35:34-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:34):**  is tumbleweeds.  You had some really interesting results from testing tumbleweeds, and I know you mentioned  it earlier that you'd gotten some, you know, when you got in the rain that you've already  
**[0:35:45-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:45):**  seen some little tumbleweed sprouts.  So tell me about how good a forage tumbleweeds are.  Okay, tumbleweeds, you kind of need to feed a little bit of energy with them.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:35:57):**  You know, on cows, cows do good with them, but still need a little bit of dry matter,  a little bit of energy with them, you know, when they're green, because they're running  up at 25%, 26% protein.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:36:11):**  And it'll be running 75, 76% TDN, but their calorie levels are down.  So you feed a little bit of energy in there with them and they do good.  Well, in the winter, when they go dormant, people, oh, they won't eat that, they won't  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:36:29):**  eat that.  If you can get them started on it while they're still just a little bit green, they'll eat  them all winter.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:36:36):**  And that first set of cows I had on them out here before last, and I didn't get the actual  weight, but he was wanting them over 700 pounds.  When they came in, they averaged 435.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:36:55):**  They were here for roughly 210 days, and they averaged a little over a pound and a quarter  a day with no supplements.  Basically eating tumbleweeds.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:37:07):**  Eating tumbleweeds.  Now this last winter, this little set of cows that I've got in now that we sold most of  them off here before I went to Kansas.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:37:20):**  We should have gotten these other ones out, but basically I had a little bit of dry grass  here and there that I was able to stockpile despite it being so dry.  And some of it was really weird because some of it was already oxidizing, which is a whole  
**[0:37:38-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:37:38):**  other discussion on soil quality and how fast these plants oxidize.  So I went ahead and I grazed that all off.  And then other than that, they were on tumbleweeds.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:37:51):**  Some of the tumbleweeds were from 2020.  And a bunch of them were from 2019.  And I went last November, I went ahead and I ran forage tests on them.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:38:06):**  And the tumbleweeds from 2020, when they were dormant, were running at 17% protein and almost  50% TDN.  The ones that were from 2019 were still running at 5% protein and 40% TDN.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:38:30):**  So all I did is I'd go out there.  I got me some molasses in a trash pump and I stepped it down to one inch deal with a  nozzle on the end of it.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:38:41):**  And I was driving around and spraying the 2019 tumbleweeds with molasses.  And boy, they would sit there and hammer that for a little bit.  And then, okay, we got enough energy.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:38:53):**  And then they'd go over and I was spraying those tumbleweeds twice a week, 600 gallons  on 84 head.  And they came through the winter good.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:39:07):**  So these people that they don't want to graze weeds or they say they want to spend money  to get rid of the weeds, it's like graze them out, get the impact.  And you may get more weeds next year, but you're going to have a little bit of grass  
**[0:39:24-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:39:24):**  here and there out of that.  And I've already seen signs of a little bit of grass last year, but it just didn't get  very big just because of the fact that it was so damn dry.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:39:38):**  So this year is going to be interesting to see how much grass comes up in there.  Gray's honored and given plenty of rest and recovery.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:39:49):**  That's what I'm going to do.  Right now I'm trying to figure out and it's going to take me a couple of three weeks before  I can come up with any sort of a plan.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:39:58):**  I may wait until November, put 1,000 head of calves on there and take it.  Just take, cramp it all down and get it eaten up and pull out.  Or if by the end of next month, if I've got them and they're three foot high like they  
**[0:40:15-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:40:15):**  were, then I'm probably going to go ahead and try to get a bunch of calves in and go  through it once and let it recover and then come back to the first part and just do it  a second time.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:40:30):**  But it's those tumbleweeds.  In 2020, I got 54,000 grazing days off of a place that if it didn't have the weeds on  it and it was the normal grass and everything that's in this area, would have amounted to  
**[0:40:55-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:40:55):**  about 16,400 grazing days.  And you got that by training them to eat other weeds.  I don't train them to eat weeds.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:41:08):**  I keep them in the pens for a couple of days, play around with them and then I'll go out  there every couple of days and play with them a little bit and they just start eating the  weeds.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:41:21):**  And the cool part is that some of these cows are like, that I'll get in down here, will  be you know, crater cows just throwing in stuff and they're, if a group splits up or  something I start riding towards one group, the other group comes running back too.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:41:38):**  You know, they're coming back on their own violation.  I'm not putting any pressure on them to do it.  They just come running back.  
**[0:41:44-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:41:44):**  So you know, there's something there that is really making these cows want to come together.  And when you get these trading cows that are doing that, that the reason that a bunch of  them got traded off is because they were too wild and tardy to begin with.

On top of diversifying the diet.  And it's just, I don't know, my wife thinks I'm crazy, but it's like, I just get tickled  
**[0:42:21-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:42:21):**  by all the changes that there are in these damn cows when you go out there and play with  them and then being able to see the changes in your forage conditions and that by what  you're doing.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:42:34):**  So how did it all go wrong?  Like we said earlier, IMG, it's nothing new, right?  It's lost.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:42:46):**  It's a lost art because this is, so what's different between IMG on somebody's ranch  and what they used to do with five guys and 5,000 head of cattle driving them from Texas  to Montana?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:42:59):**  Well, one of them asked the same question all the time and I'm not totally sure where  it all went wrong, but I do know that all these rodeo events and that don't do us any  good.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:43:20):**  They're spectator events.  They're spectator events.  Yeah, it's cool to run that calf down and get it tied down in eight seconds, but if  
**[0:43:31-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:43:31):**  you go to doctor on all your calves like that, then you're having to run down everything.  And if you're, I've hit times where I was doctoring between 40 and 50 yearlings a day  or get on a pneumonia rec, scours rec up north and you're doctoring 50 to 90 head of calves  
**[0:43:52-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:43:52):**  a day, your cattle get wild if you are jumping up there and going fast rope everyone.  So we've got this buckaroo puncher attitude thing going on in this country and it's like  both of them take, both groups take it to the extreme.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:44:16):**  Punchers got to see how fast they can do it, how much dust they can make fly and the buckaroos  are trying to make, you know, see how fancy they can look doing it, you know, but there's  gotta be a balance in there where you go in there, you take a shot, you know, you take  
**[0:44:32-0:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:44:32):**  the first shot available.  You don't sit there and spend for, you know, what seems like an eternity getting it set  up to do that double turnover with a half twist, Del Viento to doctor calf, just rope  
**[0:44:47-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:44:47):**  it.  You know, you can sit there and just pick that rope up and throw it, make a catch and  get it doctor, get it over with and you're not stirring up the cattle and, and which  
**[0:45:00-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:45:00):**  the buckaroos aren't stirring up the cattle, but they're getting the job done in a hurry.  I mean, I've watched four guys up out of Winnemucca and it took them two hours to doctor like  20 calves and it's like, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:45:21):**  And they thought I was the weird one, you know?  You should be used to that by now, Bob.  Boy, I've been the odd one.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:45:30):**  I've been the odd one out since I was a kid.  I can't believe that.  Oh yeah, it's true.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:45:37):**  I just have always had one of a different way of thinking and looking at things and  it's getting even more different the older I get.  So you don't like rodeo because it's fast and it's flashy and it's not good for the  
**[0:45:55-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:45:55):**  animals and it's, you know, I think there's a lot of things.  Well, it's not that we don't like rodeo.  It's just, I mean, that takes a lot of talent.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:46:04):**  What they're doing takes a lot of talent.  Oh, no doubt.  I mean, and you don't want to take that back to the ranch for the most part.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:46:16):**  You know, it's, you know, like saddle bump.  Okay.  Every once in a while, yeah, you're going to have a horse.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:46:21):**  Well, it is not like it was, you know, 30 or 40 years ago when you'd run a four year  old into the ground crowd, get it choked down and blindfolded and climb up on it and do  a, you know, Monty Walsh ride around the round crowd, open up the door and you're outside  
**[0:46:39-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:46:39):**  and put on 30 or 40 miles in a day.  We're not doing that anymore.  The horses aren't even anywhere close to being like that because they're not raising them  
**[0:46:50-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:46:50):**  like that.  You know, those, the foals are getting handled and they're bred to be more gentle.  So you know, we don't need to take that onto the ranch, but at least if you can ride a  
**[0:47:05-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:47:05):**  saddle bump, you should be able to stay focused enough to get one road at the ranch.  But other than that, all of the way they're doing the team roping and everything 900 miles  an hour, you know, you don't need to do it.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:47:19):**  But then again, if you try to do, like if you see, have a stockmanship deal, like, oh,  let's say the rain cow horse.  Okay.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:47:32):**  You block it up and then you have that animal with a knot in its tail and take it down the  fence at a walk, turn around, bring it back down.  And by the time you're done messing with it and going around, you know, its tail is down  
**[0:47:44-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:47:44):**  and it's relaxed.  You can't have that because that's for most people is boring to watch.  So what you're saying is stockmanship is boring to watch?  
**[0:47:55-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:47:55):**  Yeah.  Stockmanship is, and I, I think kind of, I can see the point because people want to be  distracted.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:48:05):**  They want to have all the dust flying and everything, but I prefer watching somebody  that I can't even tell what they're doing when they do it.  And there's not a whole lot of those guys around.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:48:21):**  But you get somebody that's really good that just eases through things and just makes things  happen.  You know, everything's flowing.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:48:29):**  And that to me is a thing of beauty to watch.  Being able to have that horse sit down hard and come around, round hard with the cow.  Yeah, that can, you know, that is, that's something that is needed once in a while.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:48:48):**  But for the most part, you don't do it.  You know, that little black horse that I rode up there, that sucker can sit down and come  around.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:48:56):**  But he already ever gets a chance to do it because you're not, you know, you're getting  that, that energy flow going around you for where they are going to where they need to  go without being pressured or, you know, like going to the head all the time.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:49:13):**  We do it three or four times.  Yeah, they might, they're gonna settle down and you get them to where you want to go.  But if you can remove that pressure, they get there a lot faster.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:49:25):**  When I'm coming around an animal and I'm trying to, you know, and I'm trying to make my approach  and move it, you never go for the head.  You go for the hip.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:49:35):**  Yeah.  Or go past the hip at an angle where they turn around and look at you until you get  them facing the right direction and back off and then they'll start going forward and then  
**[0:49:45-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:49:45):**  you can pick them up driving a little bit.  But you know, you don't have to go up there and just work pressure on them.  Right.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:49:54):**  And it's, it's not trying to pressure them from behind.  It's not trying to pick up their eye or their head.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:00):**  It's the hip.  It's driving that focus point on the head.  That, that deal of, oh, you got to get their eye, you got to get their eye, you know, I'm  
**[0:50:08-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:08):**  not even going to say who it is, but there's these people out there that are given the  stockmanship clinics and seminars and they're always saying, oh, you got to get the eye,  you got to get the eye.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:17):**  You have their eye as soon as you come into the patient.  Exactly.  I want to just slap them and say, you have their eye.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:25):**  If they're not doing what you want, you are in the wrong position.  You're putting too much pressure on them.  If they're not turning and they're trying to beat you, you're putting too much pressure  
**[0:50:36-0:50:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:36):**  on them.  Take a little pressure off, let them slow down and turn.  But by golly, they don't want to, they just don't want to do that.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:43):**  Oh, we got to run that cow down.  We got to run that steer down.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:48):**  Well, you got to get their eye.  You got to get their eye.  Well, it's like I say, you have their eye, they see you, but you're not giving them any,  
**[0:50:59-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:50:59):**  you're putting too much pressure on them.  They're not going to stop until you get to a point where, you know, okay, yeah, you get  up there far enough that, oh, okay, well, he's in front of us now.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:09):**  Now we'll turn when they turn around to go.  But you know, it's like in that clinic when I'm coming up, how many times did you see  me come up directly in back of an animal?  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:20):**  They would turn their head to look at me.  I shift the direction I was going and they would wrap around and go by me.  That's the direction I wanted.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:27):**  Saw it several times.  And I hope we got good drone footage of it.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:32):**  Yeah.  I need to find a way to get that narrated and I need to find an editing program where  I can take them to the Aeros like on football games.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:44):**  So if any podcast listener out there, if you've got an idea for that, take it to take it to  the Rachling Reboot Paddock on Facebook or just message Bob.  I think your friends list is about as big as mine these days.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:51:56):**  Like, no, I didn't.  That doesn't sound good.  It seems like the more we do this podcast, it's like every day they're getting four or  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:04):**  five friend requests from people.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:10):**  Oh, no, I know how I know how that goes.  Believe me.  It's like I'm at almost the 5000 limit.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:17):**  It's like unless somebody is doing the grazing and softsmanship, I just kind of set off to  the side and ignore them.  You know, every once in a while, maybe somebody that I knew in the past or someone will find  
**[0:52:33-0:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:33):**  me and want to friend me and I'll do that.  But for the most part, it's the only friends I'm doing right now are ones that are directly  related to what we're doing with regenerative grazing.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:46):**  That may sound snobbish, but it's like that's basically why I'm on there anyways.  Right.  So let's circle back to rodeo.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:52:57):**  And we both kind of agree that there's not very many skills in modern rodeo that are  translatable to skills on the ranch.  So what about ranch rodeo?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:06):**  How do you feel about ranch rodeo?  Well, ranch rodeo is I'm really gonna I mean, I'm gonna get this.  We're both gonna get hate mail for it.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:21):**  But let's go anyway.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:24):**  Yeah.  I like hate mail.  Let them take the pressure on somebody else.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:27):**  Look, look, Bob, a hater is one step away from your biggest fan.  You already have them because I don't know.  I've seen some movies where the biggest fans weren't very good.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:39):**  Oh, no, they're thinking about you every day and you get to live in their head rent free.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  That's true.  
**[0:53:46-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:53:46):**  So, you know, they they do make these events up, but they're timed.  They're wanting to do it fast, which yeah, that's how boy you get that done fast.  That's good.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:54:01):**  But then when you start looking at the amount of stress that you get on that animal, because  of the way that you did it, it's not good.  And people want people want to say that, oh, well, that stress they go get a drink of water  
**[0:54:16-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:54:16):**  and they gain that back.  But that isn't true.  I measured it too many times and they don't.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:54:25):**  I mean, I had one set of steers on our on our 48,000 acre ranch in New Mexico that got  moved or went run through the shoot twice during the summer and then once more and got  shipped in the fall.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:54:41):**  And the one group that I did not have any help with the airplane to gather weighed seven  and a half pounds more than the average on the rest of the steers, just because of the  way they were handled at one time.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:54:57):**  So, you know, if you multiply that, say, okay, seven and a half pounds, that one time, multiply  that times three, that's 22 and a half pounds per animal.  That's a big thing.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:55:12):**  That looks good in the bank account.  I mean, that's a nice bonus.  Well, the only part rawback is, is on 1997 head of steers, you're going to need a big  
**[0:55:26-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:55:26):**  bigger pot, another pot.  And there was, you know, this deal that I got now that I'm running now, it had been  an intensive grazing deal under pivots and they made the mistake of going with Bermuda  
**[0:55:44-0:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:55:44):**  grass, which takes way too much water and then you can't plant any winter for it, Charlie,  because the Bermuda is still growing when you plant that and it takes it over.  But we were shorting off a lotus, six weight steers.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:56:01):**  And they average six, it was between 6.30 and 6.35.  I don't remember exactly what.  So we weighed them, we turned them into a pan that had water.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:56:13):**  We went to lunch, came back and we sorted the lighter end off.  And then we took that six weight to put them out faster.  Well, we shipped four days later and those steers were only weighing six and a quarter,  
**[0:56:34-0:56:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:56:34):**  you know, 6.25.  Okay.  They were not willing to 6.30 that they were, or 6.30 plus that they were when we sorted  
**[0:56:41-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:56:41):**  them.  So no, that strength does not, you know, does not just come right back.  You know, you may get compensatory gain on the next guy, but personally, I don't want  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:56:54):**  to give compensatory gain away.  I want to keep it.  Right.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:57:01):**  I mean, so all the ways that they're doing the stockmanship in these rodeos, ranch rodeos,  and with the cutting horse competitions and the working cow horse competitions, it all  works against this when we try to use those methods when we get out onto the ranch.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:57:26):**  So what do people want to do?  They want to try to make their horse be like them crow horses.  And you know, I've seen some really handy guys on a horse that just are hell on cattle,  
**[0:57:39-0:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:57:39):**  you know, and your job, even if you're just an idiot cowboy is to take as good a care  of those cattle.  So your boss can make more money.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:57:50):**  But they kind of lose the aim of the bosses don't see that.  You know, it's like I told, I guess you might have been there when we're talking about that  and you do something and people go around and you do something that they were trying  
**[0:58:10-0:58:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:58:10):**  to do and they didn't get done.  And then they look at the world up and look at you.  And the day before I left the Flying W, they've got a neighbor up there that's big in the  
**[0:58:21-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:58:21):**  ranch rodeos and that.  And Josh went to, he had some running around to do and when Josie and I were out faster  when he caught up to us, he says, yeah, there was one of the heifers over in the stairs  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:58:37):**  and he says, I just slipped in there.  And he says, the neighbors were there wanting to use the fence and they were going to help.  And I said, no, that's okay.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:58:43):**  He says, I just picked that heifer up, opened the gate, worked her through, didn't lose  anything.  And the guy went there and he said, and it was just like you said, it's just in the voice,  
**[0:58:52-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:58:52):**  the same voice that you say, what was up was lucky.  But they do, they never seem to think about, well, maybe you're doing something different  that allows you to do it that way.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:59:08):**  So you were lucky, but boy, they got to work hard.  You got to make that best one.  But people are getting better.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:59:16):**  They're getting better and starting to look at it.  There's a lot of people that are loading cattle out in the pasture, you know, pulling their  bulls and just parking the trailer in the pasture and going for it.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:59:27):**  Which, you know, I got to applaud that.  That's pretty cool that they're doing that.  You know, it shows that they're wanting to go, you know, they're wanting to go for the  
**[0:59:35-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:59:35):**  right direction, but we can all get better.  So how could we tweak rodeo and ranch rodeo?  Well, I don't know if we can tweak it.  
**[0:59:51-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=0:59:51):**  But OK, we could tweak different parts of the industry.  Feedlots.  I think that I really wish they would get a deal going in feedlots to where feedlots  
**[1:00:07-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:00:07):**  send their top riders to a contest.  You know, like say these big ones like five rivers and these big feedlots that have got,  you know, several of them, they take the top 10 riders from each lot, OK, and then they  
**[1:00:23-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:00:23):**  have a contest and then it goes state, regional, and then have a national contest.  The winner prizes all along the way once you get the state level.  And then the winner of the overall deal gets a new truck and a living quarter softwares  
**[1:00:39-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:00:39):**  trader or even just the trader.  You're going to get people wanting to try to get that.  What the contest would be is they would go down and they would mark, you know, just with  
**[1:00:50-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:00:50):**  a paintball gun, just go through the pens and mark them.  Pull one cow out in each alley that a guy is going to be riding and put a heart monitor  on there.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:01:01):**  And then rather than doing it on a timed deal, you're going down there and you start out  with, say, a 200 score.  Every time you trot an animal, you get points knocked off.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:01:18):**  If you lope an animal, you get even more points knocked off.  If you lose animals out the gate, you get points knocked off.  Then you get points added back on for having the lowest reading on the heart rate monitor.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:01:37):**  And then if you do have a timed score or a tie score, the fastest time wins.  But you're not going for the fastest time.  You're going for the smoothest run of pulling those cows out of individual pens in the alley.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:01:56):**  And you're not, you know, you get points off for making mistakes rather than adding on,  you know, like they do in the softwares classes and adding on courage points.  But really getting in there and almost getting in the rest.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:02:12):**  You know what I mean?  And it would be like paint drying.  It would be like lots of paint drying.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:02:18):**  It is not a spectator sport.  It's more of a proficiency test.  Or pen miters.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:02:29):**  And you could have, you know, something similar for people on ranches.  Rather than how fast you're doing it, how smooth you do it.  But there again, there's not going to be many people who want to watch that.  
**[1:02:47-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:02:47):**  So it would have to be something that would be, you know, sponsored by Beaky Way and I  don't know, pick a trader company and a truck company.  Because I'm not going to advertise for any of them.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:03:05):**  But something like that.  And have actual schools rather than, you know, I'm going to the Sam Hills Beef Symposium  here in her conference down at Monahan Spectus next week.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:03:23):**  Just I'm going to go down there and try to meet Temple Grandin.  Well, tell her I said hello.  Well, I will.  
**[1:03:32-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:03:32):**  If I get softer, her bodyguards may keep me away.  I don't know.  I've been trying to get a hold of her for years and she doesn't ever respond to emails  
**[1:03:47-1:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:03:47):**  or making a connection on LinkedIn or anything.  So it confuses me that I'm in her book, but she won't converse with me.  I don't know if she listens or not.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:04:03):**  Maybe she'll hear this.  Yeah.  Well, it's the thing is, is she's going to give a livestock handling demonstration.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:04:13):**  Ron Gill is going to do a livestock handling demonstration.  And what happens in those things is people are watching.  But until you go down there and do it, because I don't care if you're using Bud Williams  
**[1:04:32-1:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:04:32):**  talkmanship methods or Temple Grandin's methods or my methods, you can watch me do something  or watch one of these other people do something and listen to what we're saying.  But you've got too much going on at once because you can't really see what the cow is doing  
**[1:04:49-1:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:04:49):**  to make me do what I'm doing.  You can watch Winkle.  Yeah, boy, that cow went right there.  
**[1:04:56-1:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:04:56):**  But the angles and everything else are so off that we really can't come back to our  off-shelter work invasion field.  We can't really observe it that close enough to be able to just pick it up and do it.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:05:11):**  So that's why I think we need to have a lot more stockmanship schools where even if it's  just like the two-day schools where maybe you can get a set of pens and put 100 cows  in there and you play around with those 100 cows this morning.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:05:28):**  You go out in the pasture and you play around with some out there, but you watch it and  then you walk through it and then you do it.  And everybody there gets a chance to do it.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:05:38):**  And it's got to be small class sizes.  So you get 20 people in there and it gets too much on the cattle.  It gets too much on the people and you don't get enough time in on the cattle to really  
**[1:05:52-1:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:05:52):**  start grasping stuff.  You know, that's kind of why my raising school, you know, stockmanship raising school, go  for five days because I want people to go through and get the time in the cattle, get  
**[1:06:09-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:06:09):**  the time observing what's going on, and then also see the changes in the cattle between  the start of it and the end of it.  They'll change one day.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:06:21):**  One day.  One day.  Yeah.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:06:24):**  Yeah, just change from one day to the next.  It can be pretty, pretty drastic, you know.  So you know, like my personal observation when you were here and we were out riding  
**[1:06:35-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:06:35):**  my cows, I'd had them for a year and there's one cow that I call no tail and pretty sure  that she's a half feral roped out heifer that wasn't supposed to get pregnant but  did.  
**[1:06:53-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:06:53):**  So they sold her at rock bottom prices, which is fine because she had a calf with her.  Anyway, she was always the one as soon as we'd pull out into the paddock, she'd  be at the other side watching us.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:07:05):**  You and I went out there for what, four hours.  You messed with her for 20 minutes and ever since then she's been a lot calmer, she's  been in the middle of the herd, and she's been much less skittish.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:07:19):**  Like I can get within 50 feet of her now.  That's cool.  That's good to know.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:07:27):**  That's good to know.  And I mean, 20 minutes we messed with her was, you know, getting her started the way  we wanted and then we kind of left her alone for a little bit and went back.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:07:37):**  It wasn't, you know, we're picking that bull up and those other few that didn't  make the move with everybody else.  But as soon as we picked her up and got her moving, she was expecting us to keep chasing.  
**[1:07:53-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:07:53):**  Yeah.  And when we didn't chase, because we went off to go get the bull, she looked back and  was like, uh, okay.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:08:02):**  But she was confused, like she didn't know where she was supposed to go, but then she  started going.  And the thing is, is when you do that and you give them time to think, well, then they  
**[1:08:11-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:08:11):**  just automatically gentle down and, and I don't know how much their thought process  is on.  Well, yeah, it'll be easier to go over there by those cows.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:08:21):**  You know, you don't know what their exact thoughts are, but there's something about  it that just gets them to relax down.  You know, and it's, it's, I mean, it's like when in the ostrich cows, you go riding out  
**[1:08:37-1:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:08:37):**  there and you know, they, even if they're strung out a little bit when they were calving,  I mean, they, you go riding at them and then what do they do?  They go right to the other cows.  
**[1:08:50-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:08:50):**  And even though that you're riding at them at an angle that most people would think,  well, you're going to chase them off.  And that's where, that's where a lot of people get, have problems when they first start this  
**[1:09:00-1:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:09:00):**  because they're afraid you're going to be chasing the cows off.  But just as soon as you get the cows have a reaction to you, you react to that reaction  and you know, you might have to react two or three times, but then they'll, they'll  
**[1:09:14-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:09:14):**  roll right back around and go buy you and go the direction that you want.  And it might not always be the one that you're riding at, the one you're focusing on that  reacts and takes the rest of them with her.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:09:27):**  Well, the thing is, is sometimes you'll be in that, that's the thing of how you gotta  adjust all the time because people will get, okay, we're going after that one.  Well, you might get one cow, three cows back to where you actually get a reaction off that

**[1:09:55-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:09:55):**  But you know, you pick one that you're going to focus on and you go at it and then you  have to be watching the whole bunch of cows that you're riding at and then go off of whichever  cow starts to react the fastest.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:10:11):**  Or there's a reaction, you know, that one that you're riding at, it might have to be  the first one to react.  But then you've got that other cow decides it's going to make a big reaction and start  
**[1:10:22-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:10:22):**  to run off.  Well, then you just change what you're doing to get that one to roll back without chasing  it.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:10:32):**  You know, it's that deal of that old potter's wheel, you know, you're putting that pressure  on there to get it to change into a shape that you want.  And it needs just enough pressure to tease it into the shape.  
**[1:10:46-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:10:46):**  If you use too much, you'll have a blowout and you'll ruin all your work.  Yeah, but that's, I mean, you might have that once or twice when you're starting, but it's,  it gets to the point that having a blowout is like so uncommon.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:11:04):**  It's I mean, sometimes you want to make them blow out so you got something to do.  Because it can get, you know, it can get pretty, I don't want to say monotonous or boring because  you're going out there and they're just rolling around coming by and, you know, you're in  
**[1:11:22-1:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:11:22):**  a situation where, where you're working with somebody else and going out and working a  different group every day and it starts to get boring.  Well, you can kind of have things scatter a little bit and then just put it back together  
**[1:11:35-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:11:35):**  real quick.  Because it doesn't take you any time to put that stuff back together.  Cows on highway is still not a fun way to start your day, Bob, I would much rather start  
**[1:11:46-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:11:46):**  my day drinking coffee in the pasture, relaxed and not.  Well, yeah, yeah, but it's, it could be worse.  You could be buried in your spare tire.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:02):**  Don't ever, ever cuss the mud.  Never cuss the mud.  No, I didn't cuss the mud.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:07):**  I actually, when I got stuck yesterday, I started laughing.  And I, and I took a picture of it and I sent it to my son.  He's working at a part time at a neighboring farm and, and so he sent me back.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:25):**  He said, well, I can beat you.  Here's mine.  But they, they come over with a, with another four wheel drive pickup, backed up to the  
**[1:12:33-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:33):**  trailer and pulled me out backwards because it was with that spare tire buried.  It was going to act like a, act like a D9 cat trying to pull it through the other way.  I found if you're signed to the frame rails, it's usually better to pull out from the back.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:48):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, and so since CK can't be here today, she did want to make sure that I, she had a couple  
**[1:12:58-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:12:58):**  of questions she wanted me to make sure I asked you.  Oh no, no, no.  I got to be a cyclist, but not answer.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:13:09):**  So what were, what are some of your favorite places to travel?  Oh, sheesh.  Everywhere.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:13:17):**  I should say, well, no, I can't say anywhere.  Anywhere that it's remote and I can work out.  I mean, I've worked from the right on the Canadian border.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:13:36):**  In fact, I had one day I worked in Canada cause we have to get cows back and you know,  maybe kind of a lonesome go to the North and let the fence down.  And I've worked down into Mexico and Australia and I, I just liked seeing new country and  
**[1:13:51-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:13:51):**  new cows every place I go.  So saying that I have a favorite, what the places that might be favorite, they they've  been overrun by people from urban areas trying to become country that those areas kind of  
**[1:14:11-1:14:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:14:11):**  gotten to where they're not the same anymore.  Us crazies that like to live, live way out in the boonies are getting pushed even farther  and farther back in the boonies, huh?  
**[1:14:22-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:14:22):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, it's like you get up to Montana and, and so much of that country has  
**[1:14:29-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:14:29):**  been broken up anymore.  And some developments all over the place and you know, that state, I used to love it.  You know, you could break down and you'd be the white guy in the Indian reservation and  
**[1:14:41-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:14:41):**  break down and, and somebody would stop and pull over and help you.  And from friends I have up there anymore, that's kind of gone by the wayside, which  is a shame because that's one of the great things about that state with the people.  
**[1:14:58-1:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:14:58):**  New Mexico, you can break down those self-haunting ways as they drive by it.  That's what everybody here does.  Yeah.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:15:06):**  No, you can't say that when, when, uh, when I were, yeah, you're right.  I can't, you did break down and, uh, did have a neighbor stop and help you.  Yeah.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:15:16):**  And it's like, I, I spent more time talking to people that were stopping to help than  I did loosening that, that fuel filter up and getting it pumped up for the other tank.  So that was, that was kind of a refreshing deal when I was there in Kansas that, that,  
**[1:15:31-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:15:31):**  uh, that that happened.  But I just, you know, as long as, as long as I can go out working cows in a new country  and new cows, I, I'm just, I'm about as happy as you can get, you know.  
**[1:15:48-1:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:15:48):**  Is there anywhere you've been, you wouldn't want to go back?  Oh, I don't know.  I didn't, it's kind of a mix up.  
**[1:16:02-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:16:02):**  I went to California twice last year.  In fact, I went to two places twice and I mean, I'd like, I'd like to go back to people,  but I mean, crimey putting up with California traffic.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:16:19):**  It's like, you know, I want to have, I want to have, you know, a 50 caliber on a turd  up there with radio controlling somebody to run it for me, you know, just to change lanes.  I've been to California.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:16:34):**  I've been to, uh, I've been in Northern California.  I've been to the Lake Tahoe area.  Oh, you know, it, it is pretty, it's really pretty out there.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:16:43):**  The problem is it's just all the Californians and they ruined the place.  Yeah.  Well, I was, I was raised about 80 miles from Lake Tahoe, you know, Sierra Nevada.  
**[1:16:54-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:16:54):**  That was kind of my running grounds when I was a kid.  We'd go camping up there and that and, and, and it, but it's just gotten so crowded and,  and it's like, the people have just really, I don't know how to put it, they've just really  
**[1:17:14-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:17:14):**  changed for, uh, you know, for all the political correctness, they don't have much humanity  left.  You know, it's like, I can't disagree with anything you just said at all.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:17:32):**  Yeah.  And I, and I hate saying it because, you know, I am kind of an introvert.  I'd rather be, you know, I'd love to get stuck out in remote places with a bunch of cows  
**[1:17:42-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:17:42):**  and good string of horses and you know, somebody dropped by on the weekend or something that,  you know, but I still like people, but it's like, geez, they just have no consideration.  I mean, you can have somebody sitting back off of your, your left hand side of your trailer  
**[1:18:04-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:04):**  and be there for 20 miles in the same place.  But then as soon as you make a turn signal, by golly, they got to pull up and cut you  off.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:14):**  You know, it's like, what is the point?  You know, you really want me to get road rage with my three quarter ton pickup, 22 foot  trailer with your little Miata.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:26):**  Giant steel brush guard on the front that deer just bounce off of at 70 miles an hour.  Well, I don't have a brush guard on my truck yet.  I mean, I've got one.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:38):**  I just need to put it on.  So, yeah, it's just.  How did you figure out that our cows forgot how to be cows and, and you could teach them  
**[1:18:52-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:52):**  how to be cows again?  How did you figure it out?  It was a long, long, long process.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:18:57):**  I started wondering when I was about, I don't know, I was before I was 10.  And I would ask people, you know, well, how come your sheep and your goats, they all raised  together?  
**[1:19:13-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:19:13):**  But your cows scatter out.  Well, that's just what cows do.  And I was already at that point.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:19:20):**  I mean, my dad was an electrician and I was just, you know, surrounded by these farms  and ranches.  And I spent all my free time on those farms and ranches, you know, either fishing or helping  
**[1:19:33-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:19:33):**  them work cattle or goats for sheep.  And by the time I was 10, I was starting to weed people out that I wouldn't go help just  because they were too wild and crazy on their animals, which to be making that sort of a  
**[1:19:55-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:19:55):**  decision when you're, you know, not even a teenager, not even close to being a teenager  is kind of weird.  So I've always been drawn to the war-expressed ways of doing things.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:20:09):**  You started figuring out by not ever being told what it was, not ever being told what  to do, by just watching what worked and didn't.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:20:19):**  I don't, you know, you can ask me to do anything and I'll do it.  You tell me to do it.  Chances are, I'm going to just refuse right off the bat.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:20:28):**  I don't, you know, it's just something about getting ordered.  I just, you know, have never, never gotten along with, but ask me and I'll do it.  And, you know, I got out onto some ranches where I was starting to call and it was like,  
**[1:20:42-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:20:42):**  okay, running that four year old, you managed to get on it.  Damn, he got it road rolling.  Well, hell, let's go out and gather cows and they throw the gate open.  
**[1:20:53-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:20:53):**  And it was like, I could do it, but it didn't feel right.  So you know, then I get a nap on her job and I get out there and rather than doing it that  way, I started playing around with them.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:09):**  And you know, it's really funny because the first time I ever heard about Ray Hunt was  somebody telling me, you need to quit doing that Ray Hunt stuff.  That's going to get you hurt.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:20):**  So it's, I've always been drawn to this.  And then I also would, you know, I might offer two jobs.  One of them was for $750, $800 a month.  
**[1:21:33-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:33):**  But it was in a bunkhouse or I could go out with three or 400 cows with a string of colts  by myself, but I only paid $300.  I take the $300 job.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:43):**  I mean, it's-  Trenton Larkin Cause that's your happy place.  Dave King That's what I'm doing and not putting up with  
**[1:21:49-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:49):**  the BS has always meant more to me than the cash.  Trenton Larkin Yeah, that's your happy place.  On a horse with cows by yourself.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:21:56):**  Dave King So, you know, you're starting these colts  and you're getting into, you know, you get in fresh earrings and that and you're trying  to get everything settled down.  
**[1:22:06-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:22:06):**  You know, the horse does something stupid, but you get a good reaction out of the cows  or you start playing with it.  I mean, that's basically where I started that fade turn is because a horse I was going to  
**[1:22:17-1:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:22:17):**  go turn the steer and the damn horse right before I got up there started bucking off  to the right and the steer went to the left.  And it did it again.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:22:26):**  And on the third time I thought, well, I'm going to do this a little bit different.  And right before I felt that horse getting ready to blow, I picked him up, ducked him  off right a little bit.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:22:34):**  And sure enough, the steer turned around.  So okay, well, let's play with that.  So it just little pieces of doing things by yourself where you're not being interfered  
**[1:22:45-1:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:22:45):**  with allowed me to come up with what I'm doing.  Trenton Larkin That's a lot how I've picked it up too.  You know, I so you know, my part of the story, you know, I know you and I talked about it.  
**[1:23:01-1:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:23:01):**  But so growing up on the ranch, you know, we had horses and nobody, nobody taught stockmanship  in the 80s and 90s.  Like that wasn't even talked about, you know, it wasn't till the late 90s that that people  
**[1:23:13-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:23:13):**  started talking about Bud Williams and Temple Grandin and low stress.  So when I got out of the military, and I moved back to work on the ranch in 2006.  You know, we had a there was a Bud Williams VHS that was in the area that I had access

**[1:23:36-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:23:36):**  You know, I read I read some of his bunch of his articles, I read some Temple Grandin  articles, learn about flight zones.  And I just I built everything off of that just skills, what's worked?  
**[1:23:49-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:23:49):**  What doesn't?  Oh, well, that was interesting.  They did.  
**[1:23:53-1:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:23:53):**  That cow went exactly where I wanted her to.  Why did she do that?  What did I do to make her do that?  
**[1:24:00-1:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:24:00):**  And putting those, you know, and putting those little pieces together and figuring out exactly  how that works and how you're affecting the cows psychology with those subtle little movements,  you know, the position of your shoulders, whether you're, you know, whether you're in  
**[1:24:16-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:24:16):**  there with a, you know, like an angry body set and your shoulders are really tight and  square.  You're in there.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:24:24):**  It doesn't even have to be angry body.  You can just have the emotion.  You just have the emotion.  
**[1:24:33-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:24:33):**  And that's what people really don't realize is how sensitive these are to your emotion  and focus is tied into emotion as well.  But I mean, I'm down to two horses now.  
**[1:24:49-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:24:49):**  I did have a forehead and I can walk out there on the pen with a halter and I had horses  coming up, you know, about that paint mare.  She's always kind of should be standoffish.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:25:01):**  Everything else is coming up to me.  I have a bad day for, you know, getting into an argument with somebody first thing in the  morning and I'm in a bad mood.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:25:13):**  I go down to the pens.  I go to catch my horse for the day and they just start running around me like a bunch  of bunks.  
**[1:25:19-1:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:25:19):**  You just put in the round pen the first time.  Just offer your emotions and I mean, part of it is body language.  Body language changes when you're upset and all of that comes into play and we need to  
**[1:25:37-1:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:25:37):**  learn to control that as much as we can and what I like to think of it though, not making  the cow go where I want it to, but let it go where I want it to.  And let her think it's her idea to go there.  
**[1:25:57-1:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:25:57):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I'm going to, it's like saying, you know, we've got, I've got a barbecue going on down  here, I've got prime rib, lobster, all this stinking, whatever you want to drink is there.  
**[1:26:12-1:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:26:12):**  We got dancing girls, we got everything.  If I come up back and start shoving you to go down to that, you're going to turn around  and you're looking at me and wondering what the heck I'm up to.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:26:23):**  Why are you pushing me?  You're going to turn around and throat punch me, you know, but if I come walking up right  to you and then you see me and you turn around and see what I'm doing and I just point and  
**[1:26:34-1:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:26:34):**  go, Hey, we got a hell of a feed going on down there.  Check that out.  Yeah.  
**[1:26:41-1:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:26:41):**  And then you're going to go, I don't have to tell you anymore.  So the analogy is, is you, you know, where, where a lot of people would, uh, you know,  go get behind the cow and try to drive her to the party.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:26:56):**  You want to walk from the party out to those people and just touch them on a shoulder.  And Hey, the party might just be a draw down there that, you know, you're just starting  to throw, throw things together and you want them to start down that way.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:27:11):**  But yeah, you, you want to, Hey, you know, once you head down that you're making that  point that you want them to go to be their focal point from your approach.  And if you're making the focal point for them, be you because you're driving them, they're  
**[1:27:32-1:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:27:32):**  not going to want to go.  Are they, you know, some cows would go, but if you get one that's, that's a little bit  flighty or feral or whatever, they're not gonna, they're gonna try to outrun you some  
**[1:27:42-1:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:27:42):**  place else.  For sure.  So you get this mindset to doing it and I'm getting to go that way.  
**[1:27:51-1:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:27:51):**  And the thing is, is when you start this stockmanship, you know, if you're going to be, if you're  going to try putting them together and having them go in a, in an IMG situation on, think  of a migratory grazing situation where they're going together, you know, and I've dropped  
**[1:28:09-1:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:28:09):**  off some stockmanship groups because, Oh, you could do it with a four wheeler.  You can move cows easy with a four wheeler.  No, you can't because you cannot get the angles to get these to just go up and go by it.  
**[1:28:21-1:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:28:21):**  Now, once you get the cattle where they're in that frame of mind, I have one client,  Chris Gordon's and up there at Mashed Oak, he said he got, got lazy and got in a hurry  a couple of times.  
**[1:28:34-1:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:28:34):**  If he'd go out and he'd start driving up with a four wheeler, but he would, he would cock  his body around to where he was facing the cattle as he went by them.  And he kind of stand up and crouched down as he went by and it'd work.  
**[1:28:48-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:28:48):**  But when you're just starting this out, you're not going to do that.  You know, you can't, you can't get that, that four wheeler to be looking at the animal and  moving down the side of those and then having to step in or step out, depending on, on what  
**[1:29:08-1:29:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:29:08):**  was presenting itself as you were approaching.  Now, you know, I mean, you just can't do it.  And now as, as a guy that participates in a lot of what you would call recreational  
**[1:29:20-1:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:29:20):**  fencing, we run, you know, we run, we run wheelers.  We run side by sides, like a side by side is my go-to tool for moving cows.  I mean, that's moving cows, doing herd work, bringing strays up, taking mineral, working  
**[1:29:36-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:29:36):**  on fence, whatever.  I'm in my side by side all the time.  We agree on that.  
**[1:29:41-1:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:29:41):**  And I agree with everything you just said.  There's, and the way I've gotten my cattle into, into working for me is, you know, there  is some of the approach you can do, you know, while you're moving, while you're moving,  
**[1:29:58-1:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:29:58):**  but then you have to stop and get out and I have to do things on foot.  I have to make the final, you know, 20 foot, 20 feet towards the cow on foot and then,  you know, do the fade turn and the look to get her to go where I want her to go.  
**[1:30:13-1:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:13):**  Yeah.  And I've done that with, with the two herds that I'm working with a lot that have been  on the ranch for 60 days and they're just clicking it.  
**[1:30:23-1:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:23):**  Things are just clicking.  Good.  Good.  
**[1:30:26-1:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:26):**  That's what I like to hear.  So I like to hear it when, when people get it figured out.  You've got, but you've got to understand how to do it either on foot or on horseback.  
**[1:30:40-1:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:40):**  Yeah.  You've got to understand that before you can really start to translate any of that  stuff into the side-by-side or into the four wheeler.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:47):**  Yeah.  Or, or even a dirt bike.  Yeah.  
**[1:30:51-1:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:30:51):**  But I don't think that, I don't think that, you know, when you're doing on, now the  side-by-side isn't that loud, but like a dirt bike is not that loud.  I think a lot of, I think you're going to get a, and it may not be a big difference.  
**[1:31:08-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:31:08):**  I don't know, but you're going to get, there's going to be a difference.  I think doing a horseback or a foot is going to be pretty identical, but when you start  using the machinery that's louder, um, you're like, Oh, sheesh.  
**[1:31:23-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:31:23):**  Yeah.  You gotta be real, real careful of how loud your machine is.  You know, I mean, I'm going to be 67 here in two weeks and I'm still picking up just  
**[1:31:35-1:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:31:35):**  little tiny new ones.  When I was over at the mash though, and you know, just most of the cows were getting up  and we're just going to kind of yeast feed there and get them up.  
**[1:31:47-1:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:31:47):**  And I noticed that the cows that weren't quite ready to get up, you know, they're laying  there, you'd approach them and you know, cows got that rhythm that they're chewing in when  they're chewing their cud, you know, chomp, chomp, chomp.  
**[1:32:00-1:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:32:00):**  And they would, if they weren't quite ready to get up, it would be chomp, chomp, chomp,  chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.  I mean, just chewing really fast and grinding their teeth.  
**[1:32:12-1:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:32:12):**  Okay.  Then I went down to, uh, down, down to Oklahoma to visit my, my good buddy Pedro, my Mexican  son Pedro.  
**[1:32:24-1:32:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:32:24):**  And they have them doing, you know, they're wanting to get out their horseback, but the  way things are, that he's been spending more time in the four-wheeler and checking calves  on the four-wheeler.  
**[1:32:34-1:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:32:34):**  And, and so we go out there and I said, okay, go up to one of these cows.  I don't want, I want to show you something, but you know what happened?  Instead of the cows speeding up how fast it was chewing, it completely stopped.  
**[1:32:56-1:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:32:56):**  So there is a difference in how you, on how they're reacting to the four-wheeler versus  being your horseback.  Interesting.  
**[1:33:05-1:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:33:05):**  You know, and we went to several cows and every one of them did the same damn thing.  They just quit chewing.  And yet on the mass show doing it horseback, you do that cause, cause I, I call the, you  
**[1:33:19-1:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:33:19):**  know, call the guy on over and, Oh, look at this.  And every one of them would chew faster and be grinding their teeth, which that's, that's  kind of a sign that they're going through a little bit of stress.  
**[1:33:33-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:33:33):**  Well, there could also be some other variables.  I mean, the cow, I mean, there, there, there could be a thousand other variables in there,  but that is a very, very interesting observation.  
**[1:33:43-1:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:33:43):**  Yeah.  And that's why, you know, we went to several different cows on, on with each method and  each time the cow gave the exact same response of either, you know, chewing faster and grinding  
**[1:33:55-1:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:33:55):**  her teeth or just like completely freeze.  Well, I kind of the deer in the headlights look, I'm pretty sure that that's one of those  things you're going to be looking at every time you go to a pasture and every time you  
**[1:34:07-1:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:34:07):**  go to another ranch.  Oh, that is giving me something else to look at when I go down, you know, get an inside  of cattle or I go to a school or clinic or something.  
**[1:34:17-1:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:34:17):**  That's just something else for me to look at and wonder about.  I'm going to start looking at it too.  So that's be interesting to circle back, go in a few months and talk about it.  
**[1:34:30-1:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:34:30):**  Well, I'm going to be, we don't have the date set, but I'm going to be going back up to  the flying W for a five day school when they bring their, get their yearlings in next year.  And I'm going to have a, I'm going to just go ahead and do a two day clinic for everybody  
**[1:34:53-1:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:34:53):**  that's been to a school or clinic that I'm not even going to charge you guys for it.  I'm just going to do it just so that everybody can get brushed up.  And we can kind of go across that.  
**[1:35:04-1:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:35:04):**  And that'd be a good time to catch up.  I think that'd be cool to have a,  I'd like to have you stop by again for a day or, you know, or two days.  
**[1:35:15-1:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:35:15):**  And then we can go out and we can try it on my cows first with the side by side, then  we can go out on a couple of horses.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  
**[1:35:25-1:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:35:25):**  And that'd be the test right there.  Because if they behave one way with my side by side and they behave the other way,  Yeah, the same cows, yeah, that would be a good test.  
**[1:35:36-1:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:35:36):**  But you know, we look at things on this stress and it's like, we can't even tell when, you  know, our wife gets mad gradually through the day, but then all of a sudden we notice  it, you know, and the number of people that have friends or family members that get so  
**[1:35:57-1:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:35:57):**  stressed out, they commit suicide and nobody has a clue.  So just telling me that we can tell, we can't tell when another person is so stressed out,  they're going to kill themselves.  
**[1:36:10-1:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:36:10):**  But we know if our cows are stressed or not.  You know, it's, we don't.  I think we can tell if they're on one end of the extreme stress spectrum or the other.  
**[1:36:23-1:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:36:23):**  Yeah, well, in some ways, but when, you know, your cows are already going through some changes.  And you know, it's like you get up there to the mast, oh, he's got that big bunch of English  cows that and it's like, you know, the English Continental Cross.  
**[1:36:43-1:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:36:43):**  But they, those cows are so stinking relaxed, but at the same time, you're actually more  responsive.  You know, and you go riding out there to them and they see you riding towards them, they  
**[1:36:59-1:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:36:59):**  turn and they come to you, you know, 1300 to 800 cows coming to you when they see you  coming.  And go wherever you want them to go.  
**[1:37:09-1:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:37:09):**  As long as you're using these nephids, now if you turn around and okay, they're coming  to you and you want them to go the opposite direction, and you start mashing on them to  turn them around, you're going to run up to a big fight.  
**[1:37:23-1:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:37:23):**  But if you brought out the back end up and go against them, right, they turn around,  everything turns around and goes the way you want.  And you can affect them from, you know, from 100 yards off.  
**[1:37:38-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:37:38):**  But they're also super, super just relaxed and content in ways that are kind of hard  to explain.  Because until you see it, all the differences, I mean, you're seeing some of those differences  
**[1:37:55-1:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:37:55):**  now.  Oh, yeah.  You know, show up in your cows a little bit.  
**[1:38:00-1:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:38:00):**  But the more you do, you go through this, the more these things are going to show up.  Yeah, I agree.  So, I've got a few questions from the Ranching Reboot Paddock that we need to get through.  
**[1:38:14-1:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:38:14):**  So I think you've probably already read most of these.  So Michael Kinsey wants to know, how do you train the cattle to only eat the top third  of the grass?  
**[1:38:24-1:38:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:38:24):**  You don't, they just do it.  And he worded it, make Bob explain.  And I'm like, man, you don't make Bob do anything.  
**[1:38:35-1:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:38:35):**  Brian, I'm rubbing my eye at him right now.  So the next one we got coming up is John Wagner.  Well, I'll explain this a little bit more.  
**[1:38:55-1:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:38:55):**  As you make your changes in your stockmanship, there's a whole bunch of changes that come  around on these cattle on top of acting as a herd.  And one of the big ones is rather than just going for the sweet forage or that fresh,  
**[1:39:17-1:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:39:17):**  young, short grass, they're going for the most nutritious plants there.  Your nutrition in your grasses is generally in the top third, which is kind of interesting  when you stop and think about that, you know, as long as you leave half that plant, then  
**[1:39:39-1:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:39:39):**  what's going on?  The roots don't need to expend any energy.  You've still got your solar panels going, your roots are still growing, and your grass  
**[1:39:50-1:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:39:50):**  regenerates.  And it regenerates faster because you're not having to draw the energy down off the roots.  And it's got a bigger solar panel, it doesn't have to go as far to recover.  
**[1:40:04-1:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:40:04):**  So it just recovers that much faster.  And one of the things I'd like to put out, this is one of the things I'd really like  to see a study done on because I had cattle going on an IMG deal on center fillings.  
**[1:40:21-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:40:21):**  And the guy I was working with, he was all for fences, he's trying to figure this deal  out with the fences, and he's doing daily moves.  Well, we both have the same number of cattle on the same size pasture of the same type  
**[1:40:37-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:40:37):**  of grass.  And basically, I mean forage quality and everything is the same.  Well, he's out there with his fences, and he's doing his daily moves, and they're biting  
**[1:40:49-1:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:40:49):**  that down to about two inches.  Well, my cows were only taking the top third.  Places may be down close to half, but they were just taking the top third to one half.  
**[1:41:03-1:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:41:03):**  You would think that those cattle would be ready to go out faster than the other ones  because they weren't eating as much grass.  But actually, the other ones were having to come out of the pasture two to four days earlier  
**[1:41:22-1:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:41:22):**  than the ones that were just eating the top third of the grass.  Now there's got to be something in there where, it's like you have your Bobolinks and your  cheese nuggets and stuff.  
**[1:41:40-1:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:41:40):**  If it's a higher nutrition, you need less of it to be full.  And these cattle, they're all Mexican cattle, come from the same source.  They know how to hustle in big country.  
**[1:41:56-1:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:41:56):**  Well, yeah, they know how to hustle in big country, but you've got these two.  I did my little Wiki on them, and they're eating the top third, and they're staying  in that pasture two to four days longer before they get all the way around.  
**[1:42:10-1:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:42:10):**  It was easy to tell when they got around it because they started around the outside, and  they worked their way around in circles until they got to the middle.  And when they finally got into the middle of the pivot, well, we're done.  
**[1:42:20-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:42:20):**  Well, this guy was doing his daily moves, eating it all the way down, happened to pull  off earlier.  It's taking longer for his pastures to regenerate.  
**[1:42:38-1:42:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:42:38):**  But there was no difference in gain.  Now, those cattle are eating more, but gaining the same.  So that's telling me that when the cattle are eating more of that plant, their gut bacteria  
**[1:42:57-1:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:42:57):**  is efficient because it's got the wrong nutrition level.  That's interesting.  So when you get these cattle making this change and you don't force them into the change,  
**[1:43:17-1:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:43:17):**  you're just doing your stockmanship and being consistent with it until they come together.  They make that change to eating that top third of the plant on their own.  It's not something that you're craning them.  
**[1:43:30-1:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:43:30):**  We don't have to...  We're craning ourselves, not the animals.  We're craning ourselves to let these animals graze the way they would normally graze, which  
**[1:43:41-1:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:43:41):**  is looking for the best nutrition possible.  And I've got a guy, Bill Johnson in Missouri, that he's been doing this for a few years.  And he sent me a picture here a year ago, a video actually.  
**[1:43:56-1:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:43:56):**  It might have been last January.  I don't know when.  I can't remember exactly when it was, but he had all this lush green grass about six  
**[1:44:06-1:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:44:06):**  inches high.  And he's got a big stand of multi-floral roses.  And those cows were all in those roses eating the new leaves off the roses rather than eating  
**[1:44:20-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:44:20):**  that fresh green grass.  There's a lot of nutrition in those leaves.  And in those rose petals.  
**[1:44:27-1:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:44:27):**  That's where all the sugars are.  That's where they put all their energy.  But that's a good follow-in.  
**[1:44:33-1:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:44:33):**  It's a good segue into the next question from John Wagner is, how do you instill the behavior  in the livestock so that they do not return to areas that have not fully recovered?  Because the areas that aren't fully recovered don't have the highest planar nutrition.  
**[1:44:56-1:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:44:56):**  It's that simple.  Cows are kind of like people in a way.  Boy, I get stressed out and I start eating Snicker bars and Mars bars.  
**[1:45:11-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:45:11):**  I kind of like a glass of milk with it.  But cookies, cake, anything with a lot of sugar in it, when I get stressed, I'll start  re-cramming on the junk food.  
**[1:45:24-1:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:45:24):**  And that's exactly what cows are doing the same thing.  They're out there, they're stressed, they're not happy.  We think, oh well, cows are out there eating.  
**[1:45:32-1:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:45:32):**  They don't have any stress on them.  And they're going for that real washy, low nutrition level grass.  But if you've got your grass out there, and even your grass that's headed out a little  
**[1:45:48-1:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:45:48):**  bit is going to be more nutritious than that grass that's just coming back.  Because unlike what people say, the grain isn't natural for animals.  Grain is just grass seed and they will take and strip those off because that's got more  
**[1:46:06-1:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:06):**  nutrition in it than grass that hasn't been recovered.  It's a lot of fun to watch my cows in September eat Indian grass seed heads and Big Blue.  Yeah.  
**[1:46:19-1:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:19):**  Yeah.  Just get out there and just strip it off.  They're eating yuccas and thistles this week.  
**[1:46:27-1:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:27):**  Yeah, those yuccas are fun.  Boy, they really like that.  That's cow candy.  
**[1:46:35-1:46:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:35):**  You're lucky.  Your yuccas are a lot shorter than ours.  They got to climb up the side of them sometimes to be able to get their tongue wrapped around  
**[1:46:42-1:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:42):**  the stalk to pull the washes down.  My corianderies, they like to pull the whole plant up and like munch on the roots and then  spit out the fiber, all the fiber bits off the bottom of the leaf.  
**[1:46:55-1:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:46:55):**  Then of course, they love the blooms on the stem, those yellow blooms.  Those things just have to be super, super tasty.  Yeah, those blooms are cow candy.  
**[1:47:08-1:47:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:47:08):**  But it's just as you change your stockmanship and getting the more you get to where you  go out there and your cows are responding by going where you want them to go without  having to put a lot of pressure on them.  
**[1:47:29-1:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:47:29):**  Just kind of go riding out there.  They pick up your head and they look at you, oh, you want to go over that way?  Okay.  
**[1:47:36-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:47:36):**  Then just start coming to you and go by you.  The more you've got that in there, the more that they're acting as a herd, the more you  find out that they have a really wide variety of what they eat.  
**[1:47:51-1:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:47:51):**  I was up in North South Dakota here a few years back and they were asking about, what  do you think they'll eat?  Leafy spurge.  
**[1:47:59-1:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:47:59):**  I said, well, I didn't try it yet, but I can't see why not.  You know, it's got any nutrition in it.  We do the school and his extension agent comes out.  
**[1:48:13-1:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:48:13):**  We're going to go look around and see where they need to spray for their leafy spurge.  By golly, their big batches of leafy spurge were gone.  Cows have just gone in here and ate it on their own.  
**[1:48:28-1:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:48:28):**  You don't have to teach them to eat weeds.  You don't have to teach them to graze that top third because I don't know of any way  that you could teach them to do that.  
**[1:48:40-1:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:48:40):**  It's just a natural thing that happens when you get your stockmanship right.  I think there's a part of it that, okay, so almost all the weeds in a pasture, almost  everything in a pasture, a cow will eat at some time of the year.  
**[1:49:03-1:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:49:03):**  And you're like, I'm struggling to come up with an example.  Well, African root.  African root.  
**[1:49:12-1:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:49:12):**  It's deadly when it's green.  Cows will eat it after it's froze down.  It's probably a pretty good feed after it's frozen in the winter.  
**[1:49:23-1:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:49:23):**  You know, I never got around to it because I was living down to my brand, but this next  year I'll have to take and send in a forage sample on it.  And also on silver nightshade because I discovered that the day after silver nightshade freezes,  
**[1:49:41-1:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:49:41):**  cows will hammer the heck out of it.  Interesting.  Yeah.  
**[1:49:46-1:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:49:46):**  And it's, now that's my, you know, any cattle that I've had for, you know, a month or more,  they'll hammer it.  Other cows may not touch it at all, but once you get them to where they're looking for  
**[1:50:02-1:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:50:02):**  that highest nutrition, I mean, there's just, you know, there'll be a change in that weather  you get that freeze.  And then all of a sudden, there they are.  
**[1:50:10-1:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:50:10):**  You can't take them off of that silver nightshade.  They're just hitting it.  So our stockmanship methods actually inhibit cattle behavior.  
**[1:50:25-1:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:50:25):**  And people think, you know, they make this claim that, oh, well, my cows are calm.  My cows are relaxed and everything.  You know, I really got to push on them, get them going anywhere.  
**[1:50:37-1:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:50:37):**  And it's, I kind of relate it to, like a friend of mine in Australia said when I was down  there, you know, we're talking about all this and he goes, yeah, Bob, you know, and he was  a chopper pilot.  
**[1:50:49-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:50:49):**  And he goes, he'd be amazed what a good chopper pilot and a couple of guys on bikes that are  good, how fast they can get those cows quiet.  And I said, so you're, you know, you're saying that that helicopter and dirt bikes calms  
**[1:51:07-1:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:51:07):**  them down?  He goes, yeah.  I said, well, do you mean to tell me that the only reason that the Jews were really  
**[1:51:13-1:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:51:13):**  kind of calm, quiet, and stress free from the barbed wire machine guns?  Because it's the same thing.  We think just because they're quiet means that they don't have any stress, but sometimes  
**[1:51:26-1:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:51:26):**  they're quiet because they have too much stress.  And I can see that.  And I think some people are that, get that way too.  
**[1:51:38-1:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:51:38):**  You know, I started getting stressed and I can be just real quiet, just, you know, kind  of halfway watching and I'm cautious about what I'm doing, whereas, you know, the rest  time I'm just kind of be bopping around and doing what I do and I'm relaxed.  
**[1:51:56-1:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:51:56):**  But people can't tell that I'm not relaxed when I'm being quiet and cautious.  And you know, like there again, we're going back to the point you can't tell it in a person.  How are you going to tell it in a cow?

**[1:52:26-1:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:52:26):**  fencing?  Well, if you don't have to buy recreational fencing and you don't have to make daily moves,  you're late.  
**[1:52:42-1:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:52:42):**  You know, and here again, I got this discussion on Facebook and you get these people that  have got little, you know, they got a hundred acres.  Okay.  
**[1:52:52-1:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:52:52):**  Yeah.  Go ahead and do your fences on a hundred acres.  If you're rotating between 200 acre pastures, you know, and they're irrigated and whatnot,  
**[1:53:02-1:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:02):**  that's a different story.  You can do it.  IMG is going to be cheaper.  
**[1:53:06-1:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:06):**  You get out down here for...  In big range country.  Yeah.  
**[1:53:13-1:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:13):**  I did a grazing program on the circle ranch down here.  A couple of years ago.  It's been damn near 10 years ago I did that.  
**[1:53:22-1:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:22):**  But um...  You sure it wasn't just last week?  Oh man.  
**[1:53:26-1:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:26):**  I don't know.  My kids don't fit having birthdays and making me older, you know.  But it was 32,000 acres.  
**[1:53:33-1:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:33):**  So I had 460 some odd head that I'm running through the raising program.  Now normally they would have, they'd be out there and putting up temporary fence and having  crews move the fence.  
**[1:53:49-1:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:53:49):**  And then whenever they had, you know, they get to, you know, one pasture without then  all those sub pastures and moving the fences and their next move was going to be two or  three miles away.  
**[1:54:01-1:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:54:01):**  They're going out and they're getting three or four guys to go move cattle.  Well I did the same thing and doing it three days a week.  Now and I couldn't run a true IMG where it was all in one herd because the water system  
**[1:54:18-1:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:54:18):**  was set up where, you know, you couldn't...  You had four or five water points in the same pasture.  So you'd break them up into groups of 100, 120 and then work with each group within the  
**[1:54:33-1:54:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:54:33):**  deal.  But then I got to the one end of the ranch where I had, I was able to split them in half.  I could leave the house at noon, drive the 25 miles out there, make my moves on both  
**[1:54:51-1:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:54:51):**  of my adjustments on both groups and I'd be back in town by six.  I don't think you can get much more efficient on it than that.  And when our NRCS guy went out and he did the measurements and everything, he said I  
**[1:55:09-1:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:55:09):**  actually got better coverage, better impact doing that than they had done with the fences  and that it was like 80% cheaper on the labor.  So it's going to vary when you get to bigger places.  
**[1:55:31-1:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:55:31):**  And if you get in a real rough country, yeah, you might need to make your adjustments on  there every couple of days or every day if you've got like a riparian area you're trying  to protect or you're moving your point for the watering every day or every other day  
**[1:55:52-1:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:55:52):**  you won't be out there.  But if you don't have that riparian area or the ground isn't extremely rough where you  got to keep sending them up different draws, I'd let cattle go for up to a month and they  
**[1:56:08-1:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:56:08):**  began to find for a month.  And that was on a section of Milo that I was grazing standing Milo and I put them up where  they were alongside of the one fence and they barely made it down halfway down the fence  
**[1:56:30-1:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:56:30):**  about maybe 70 yards wide on 722 head of stairs.  When I went after a month to pick them up, there were only five heads that weren't right  in the main bunch and they were only like 100 yards away.  
**[1:56:43-1:56:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:56:43):**  So yeah, the labor savings is pretty astronomical when you get into your infrastructure part  of it.  On these bigger deals, you can make a pretty big savings on that too because rather than  
**[1:56:58-1:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:56:58):**  having all those small water points going out, you can either bring them together or  make a couple bigger ones or get portable ones with storage tanks.  You know, that punchy tank in...  
**[1:57:16-1:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:57:16):**  Yeah, the one that looks like a chicken drinker.  Like an oversized chicken drinker.  Yeah, and it's got a 3,000 gallon storage tank on it.  
**[1:57:26-1:57:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:57:26):**  So, sheesh.  You know, you say, you know, you've got six of them.  You have three of them set up where your cows are at.  
**[1:57:34-1:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:57:34):**  The other three would set up a mile and a half away.  Just bump them into your water line.  All your water is only going when you're doing it.  
**[1:57:44-1:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:57:44):**  All your water is just going to where your cattle are at at one point.  So you're not losing water pressure going around to, you know, three, four, five different  water points.  
**[1:57:58-1:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:57:58):**  Or if your set's not raising in different pastures, you know, you may have a water line  going through that's watering 20 different places at once.  So you're, you know, you really have problems with your water flow then and cattle are forced  
**[1:58:12-1:58:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:58:12):**  to sit around and drink.  But with those portable ones like that, you can just go ahead and your cattle are drinking  all at one spot.  
**[1:58:21-1:58:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:58:21):**  You've got storage to where it keeps up with them.  And then when you make your move, you just move them down to the next tank, set of tanks,  and then leapfrog the other ones to the next spot.  
**[1:58:36-1:58:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:58:36):**  So you know, that right there is saving you a bunch on water infrastructure.  Yeah, that pipe's not getting any cheaper.  So, yeah, this stuff isn't getting any cheaper.  
**[1:58:48-1:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:58:48):**  And if you can, and I do not know what the maximum, and of course, it's going to vary  for type of country.  If you're in Idaho or some places down here where you're right smack dab in the mountains,  
**[1:59:04-1:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:04):**  yeah, you might need a couple of guys.  But I don't know what the limit is to the number of cows that one guy can make the moves  with.  
**[1:59:14-1:59:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:14):**  Be something to try to figure out one day.  Well, the thing is, is there at the Mashtolo, Chris Jorgensen has had times where he didn't  have any help.  
**[1:59:28-1:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:28):**  And he was moving 1,800 head of right cows by himself.  That sounds reasonable.  Yeah.  
**[1:59:37-1:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:37):**  So, I mean, how many people were going to...  It's outside the realm.  Yeah.  
**[1:59:42-1:59:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:42):**  So we don't know.  And I mean, ranching for profit says one person per thousand head.  So okay, we've got here, and I mean, he's got one other guy working with him now.  
**[1:59:54-2:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=1:59:54):**  But I mean, if one guy can be running 1,800 head, what is the limit?  I don't know what the same limit is.  I'd like to push it.  
**[2:00:05-2:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=2:00:05):**  That'd be fun to do sometime.  It really would.  Oh yeah, I believe it.  
**[2:00:10-2:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=2:00:10):**  I like to push limits.  And speaking of limits, we're definitely pushing the limits.  This is our record longest episode by at least 15 minutes.  
**[2:00:19-2:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=2:00:19):**  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, no, don't apologize.  I love talking to you.

There's plenty of stuff on the table, and I'm sure this is just the first of many great  
**[2:00:34-2:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/23-Bob-Kinford-The-Truth-of-Intentional-Stockmanship-e150jpm#t=2:00:34):**  conversations coming down the line in the future, Bob.  Yeah.  I really want to thank you for your time.

A couple of days before release date, Clay Connery, host of the Working Cows podcast,  texted me and proposed a friendly little competition, Red Hills Rancher versus Working Cows, first

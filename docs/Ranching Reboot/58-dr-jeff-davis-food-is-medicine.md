**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:05):**  So today we're here in the Eastus Media Studio and I have my friend Dr. Jeffrey Davis with  us.  And we've been riding around a little bit on the ranch this morning talking about cows  
**[0:01:14-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:14):**  and grass and ecology.  And well, Dr. Jeff, let's get into you.  So what do you do?  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:24):**  What's your day job when you're not out here riding around looking at my cows?  Yeah, so thank you for having me.  This is actually the first podcast I've ever been on.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:31):**  So hopefully I get it right.  So my background is in family medicine.  My board certification is as a family doc.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:40):**  And so I always say that a family doc is someone who's kind of a jack of all trades but master  of none.  You know, we're really trained to take a high level view of a person's health.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:01:52):**  And we have certain areas of expertise that we get into.  But really touch on just about every part of human health you can think of, whether  it's hormonal health, whether it's nutrition, cardiovascular health.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:02:07):**  So that's my general background where I come from.  About eight years ago, I changed my focus on how I did my practice, how I practiced  my art, I guess you could say.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:02:24):**  I was seeing that I was giving people, the way I like to phrase this is I was using pill  for problem, meaning that someone would come in with a complaint and I would match that  complaint to a pill and given prescription they would walk out.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:02:39):**  And I was rinsing and repeating that over and over again.  What I was feeling though is I wasn't really helping people live healthier lives.  And part of what's happened in medicine is that as we've gone down this third party  
**[0:02:55-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:02:55):**  payer system, insurance companies are, they pull back on how much they're paying doctors,  especially primary care.  We're kind of bottom of the barrel when it comes to reimbursement.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:03:08):**  And so the way you fix that is in volume.  So you need to see, you know, a family doc back in the day, 10, 15 people would be a  full day.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:03:19):**  So there's family docs now that see 30, 40 a day.  And I know that in one of the areas, so my main clinic is in Wichita, Kansas, and then  we have a satellite clinic in Hutchinson.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:03:30):**  And I know in Hutchinson, the large clinic in that town, their goal is to see a patient  every seven and a half minutes.  Seven and a half minutes.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:03:40):**  Seven and a half minutes.  That sounds about like about how much time that I normally get to spend with my doctor.  Yeah, in fact, when we opened that satellite, I remember a patient saying, oh my gosh, you've  
**[0:03:52-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:03:52):**  spent more time with me today than I've ever spent with my doctor.  And I thought they meant like, you know, the amount of time I spent in this appointment  compared to a normal appointment with him.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:04:03):**  And I explained to him, I go, well, you know, because we don't take insurance, and I'll  get into that a little bit later, we're not required to have that high of a volume and  we can spend more time talking.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:04:11):**  And they said, no, in all the years cumulative I've spent with my doctor, you just spent  more time with me.  So and that's really where I think I realized that this pill for problem approach wasn't  
**[0:04:24-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:04:24):**  working.  And I wasn't getting, I wasn't being fulfilled by my job.  So I put myself back through training, went and learned a lot more about nutrition.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:04:36):**  Because they don't teach you a whole lot about nutrition in medical school, do they?  No, I always joke that you, what I learned about nutrition in medical school, I could  write on the back of a matchbook with a crayon.  
**[0:04:49-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:04:49):**  Like it was a short lecture.  And probably everything in that lecture was wrong.  From what I've, or I would say, from what I know now, it was wrong.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:01):**  And I don't want to stop the roll you're on.  But aren't we really understanding that the basics, the basis of human health has to start  with nutrition?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:11):**  Yeah, I mean, in our clinic we have this, we have these principles, we call them the  pillars of health.  And essentially it's looking at five things that you need as a human.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:23):**  And so I always say you need food, right?  Food and water.  So those are our inputs in your world.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:30):**  You need to move.  So even people in comas have to be moved occasionally or they die.  Like get bed sores or fluids accumulate.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:38):**  Exactly.  So you got to pump lymphatic fluids around, you got to keep muscles moving.  So you need movement.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:44):**  We need sleep.  In fact, Guinness Book of World Records now no longer allows you to try to set a new record  for sleeplessness because people die once they get, there's a threshold where if you  
**[0:05:55-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:05:55):**  try to go without sleep much longer than that, you die.  I know I've been without sleep working hard when I was in the military for close to 60  hours.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:04):**  And it's like, it's like drinking a case of beer.  You have no idea what's going on.  Yeah, you're impaired for sure for that.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:11):**  So and then elimination.  So you know, we think elimination of bowel and bladder, but it's also eliminating toxins  in your environment.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:21):**  Maybe eliminating negative narratives about yourself.  You know, things that we tell ourselves and we are harder on ourselves than probably most  people are on us.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:29):**  So we help patients think about that elimination as being things that maybe you're doing in  your lifestyle that's not productive, things in your relationships that aren't productive.  Your negative narratives, not just your bowel and bladder movement, but bowel and bladder  
**[0:06:41-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:41):**  is obviously a big function of that.  And then the fifth pillar is purpose.  You know, something we were talking about this morning is that your passion and what  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:50):**  you're doing really drives that purpose.  And you have a very clear focus.  And I mean, I can tell something comes up to you.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:06:58):**  You immediately think about how is that going to make me grow better soil, grow a better  cow?  And if it doesn't, I bet your answer is not interested.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:07:08):**  Most likely, yeah.  So those are kind of the five principles that guide our care for our patient population.  So about eight years ago, I went back and I did some education in a field that's called  
**[0:07:23-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:07:23):**  integrative and functional medicine.  And I always joke that functional medicine is, it's complicated.  It's fixing the problems you didn't know you had in ways you don't understand.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:07:34):**  So but that's functional medicine.  I think the better way to look at it is fixing problems by starting with lifestyle first.  So you know, like I said this morning, we were talking about how to fix a problem.  
**[0:07:48-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:07:48):**  I would rather fix a problem by subtracting something from the equation than adding something  and adding me either a pill or even a supplement.  I would rather figure out, okay, do I need to take something away from what you're doing  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:00):**  or maybe a food that you're eating or something that you're doing that's destructive?  And that would be where we would start.  So that's kind of functional medicine.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:08):**  Every problem we approach, we start by saying, okay, how is the organism doing as a whole?  Really try to think of the person as a whole person.  So more holistic approach to medicine, looking at the entire system rather than just saying,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:20):**  well, this is a symptom, we're just going to keep throwing pills at it until it gets  better.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:25):**  So and family docs really, I mean, we out of the gate were built to think about the  whole human.  I mean, you know, I used to say that I was a wound to the tomb, you know, but I don't  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:35):**  deliver babies anymore.  So it's just a cradle to the grave.  But we really do take care of just about every problem you can think of.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:42):**  So I think for me that my background really helped me understand that, okay, I need to  take a more holistic approach and go get more education.  But what it also meant is I can't do it in seven minutes.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:08:53):**  So did all this hit you just like all at once?  Or was it kind of like a slow dawning realization?  I would say I would say it was an iterative process.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:04):**  My resolve to be more satisfied in my practice led me to trying to figure out how I can affect  change that's translational change in people.  Like I'm going to take you from where you are now and put you somewhere else.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:19):**  That's translating you.  And then realizing that, okay, I can't do that in a seven minute visit.  So in the current model of third party reimbursement, I'm either going to have to get, I'm going  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:32):**  to have to sell a couple of my kids.  Or a kidney.  Or a kidney.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:38):**  Or I'm going to have to change the way I, change the value proposition that I have in  what I do.  And so what I did, and it's kind of crazy, we were talking about Obamacare or the, I'm  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:48):**  sorry, the Affordable Care Act.  I don't want to use the-  Yeah, the very appropriately named Affordable Care Act.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:09:54):**  Because everybody's health care has gotten more affordable.  But so I started a practice, Pray Health and Wellness is the name of my practice.  And we went cash only, which means I took no government contracts, no third party payers.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:09):**  Everything was, you know, fee for service.  And we have a membership model where we do this, where people just pay a monthly membership.  And for that they get, you know, we do a pretty advanced lab panel once per year.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:20):**  And they get discounts on medications, discounts on other labs that might be needed, and they  don't pay for their appointments.  So we just kind of, we really are trying to simplify the model and saying, we're here  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:30):**  to take care of you.  And then I have a whole team of people that help me do that.  So I have-  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:36):**  So it's kind of like, this is your subscription and come in and we'll help you figure out  how to feel better.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:42):**  So we have, we have a naturopathic doctor.  We have doctors of osteopathy.  So my background is MD.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:50):**  So there's MDs, there's DOs, there's NDs.  We have a doctor of chiropractic medicine.  We have-  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:10:56):**  I thought you, I thought your real doctors didn't associate with chiropractic doctors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:02):**  Growing up, the term was chiropractic.  But you know, it's a funny story.  I had, I woke up one morning and I could not move.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:10):**  And I tried all the tricks I knew how to do.  And I couldn't, I had a rib, I guess, that was out of a facet, which is a tiny little  joint in your back.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:19):**  And I went and saw a chiropractor and he did his little thing and I thought, well, that's  not going to do anything.  And the next morning I woke up and I felt perfect.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:28):**  And I thought, okay, I need- you know what?  Maybe there is something.  Maybe there's something to it.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:32):**  And so I think a lot of things are like that.  Like I think you can kind of subdivide most doctors into two groups.  The group that says, well, that's interesting.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:41):**  That wasn't what I thought.  I need to probably learn more about that.  And then the group that goes, well, that doesn't make sense.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:48):**  I don't believe in that.  That's scary.  Right.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:11:52):**  So I try to fall on the side of saying, hey, I don't know everything.  And you know, there's definitely ways of doing things that are new.  And so I'm open to a lot of different ideas.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:03):**  And I think that's served our patient population well.  Awesome.  And I guess since Tanya just spoke up, I should have mentioned in the intro that my lovely  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:11):**  better half Tanya is here in the studio with us.  I got a little bit focused on my spiel and just kind of left that part out.  Sorry about that, dear.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:19):**  It's okay.  I won't stay quiet too long.  Okay.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:24):**  One of the things I just wrote down, and we can- we need probably get to this later, is  like how would another doctor that's listening to this who just had the light bulb moment,  what would you have to say to him if he wants to be more like you?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:43):**  And maybe that question is not fully formed and we can always circle back to that later.  No, I think that's a question I get a lot.  You know, and it was funny when we started the practice and decided to go cash based,  
**[0:12:53-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:12:53):**  that was the month before Obamacare became law of the land.  So here I was, medical practice in Wichita, Kansas that said we don't take insurance when  everybody in the United States is now required to have insurance.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:04):**  And I thought, great, we're sunk.  Your investors probably thought you were nuts.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:10):**  And well, my investor was me.  You know, my wife and I, we emptied our savings accounts and I started going back and moonlighting  and working in the ERs.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:18):**  And we started really pinching pennies when we opened the business.  You know, got a small gift from my father and that helped us kind of get rolling.  And you know, we started with two providers.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:31):**  Was myself and my nurse practitioner, Jolene Zvenuska, who she's just unbelievably talented.  What year did you open?  So this was, we just celebrated our eighth anniversary.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:42):**  So yeah, eight years ago.  And you know, Jolene's expertise was in women's hormones and women's health.  And so we made a pretty good team.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:13:52):**  And now we have 11 providers and two clinics.  And it's been amazing.  In fact, over the pandemic, I was fairly controversial in our area for using for actually treating  
**[0:14:05-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:05):**  COVID, which I never would have dreamed that being a doctor that treated somebody who is  sick would be controversial.  But that's, that's where it came.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:14):**  And what happened is our practice exploded.  I mean, we have a waiting list now.  It got up to over a thousand people.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:21):**  And so we had to publicity is never a bad thing, even if it's controversial publicity,  really.  And if your waiting list is that big, like, what's that in comparison to your client base?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:31):**  I mean, you don't have to say the number if you don't want to.  I'm just I'm just kind of curious.  Like, do you have as many people on the waiting list as you can take care of?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:38):**  Yeah, so that that well, that's why we started the waiting list is we wanted to make sure  number one, that we kept the quality high.  We didn't want to I didn't want to then go back to that, oh, I got to see somebody every  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:47):**  seven minutes.  And so we said, well, we're gonna have to find some more providers.  And we got to find people who think outside the box and don't just do pill for problems.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:14:56):**  So that makes it a little bit more challenging to find a doctor.  But we brought two new doctors on and so we're starting to work through that waiting list.  But you know, in a in a direct primary care model, which is the business model we follow.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:08):**  So in a direct primary care model, a doctor can take care of anywhere from 800 to 1200  people depending on support staff, depending on how you want to do that, you know, and  there's some direct primary care clinics where it's the doctor, a nurse and a receptionist  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:24):**  and that's it.  They don't have any other support staff and that doctor supposed to remember details about  1000 patients.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:29):**  Yeah, right.  And and so I like the team approach.  And I like I feel like more, more minds working on a problem is better.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:37):**  So we have actually, the way we are clinic is actually constructed all of the doctors  sit in one office.  So my old practice, each doctor was in their own pod that couldn't physically be further  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:49):**  from another doctor.  And I think that was kind of by design, everybody kind of went off in their own hallway in their  own at the end of their own hallway.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:15:56):**  Well, yeah, they want to have their own echo chamber.  You know, or just or just put their nose to the grindstone, maybe, you know, not be distracted.  So in in my clinic, I said, No, I want us all to be in the same room.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:06):**  So we sit in a room about this size, we have desks all the way around the windows.  And what's fun about that is we can come in and say, man, I had a really difficult patient  and that's struggling with this issue.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:17):**  And here's what we've tried.  And, you know, I'll be talking out loud.  And some people say, Oh, you know what, I read an article the other day.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:22):**  Have you tried this?  Or have you thought about this?  Or, you know, just be somebody who thinks about the problem from a different angle.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:28):**  Right.  And that makes me a better doctor to hear that, for us to be able to as a team kind  of work through these problems.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:35):**  So I think that's another something I would recommend if any doctors think about doing  that is don't don't feel like you got to be the one man army.  Don't try to do it all on your own.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:44):**  Clean out the break room, move all your desks in there.  Yeah, yeah, get it.  Talk to each other, talk to each other and find out what's working.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:16:51):**  And what I think what I really love about the model that I've discovered over time  is the patience we attract.  So when, you know, in my old practice, when someone's I'd say, Oh, what brings you  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:01):**  in today?  Well, back you're the you're the guy on the back of my insurance card.  I'm supposed to go to like, Oh, that makes me feel great.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:07):**  Yeah, you know.  And so now, you know, when when someone sees me, it's like they they're there because  they need help.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:17):**  And they believe I have something that can help them.  And they have purposefully sought you out.  And from what they know about you and your practice and how you treat people and they  
**[0:17:26-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:26):**  want to pay the premium in cash to come see you.  Yeah, yeah.  And so what it does is it gives us that patient that's really motivated towards that translational  
**[0:17:37-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:37):**  change, which ultimately makes my job more fun.  And hopefully makes me a better doctor, you know, better at meeting that patient's need.  So that I think that's the thing I love about the model is that, you know, we know exactly  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:49):**  how many patients we have because we know how many are on the membership and continue  to pay.  And and that's, you know, that's our value proposition.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:17:57):**  If we're not creating value, that number is going to go down.  If we're creating value, that number should go up.  So it makes understanding your your how you're doing at your job a lot better.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:06):**  Because the way you know, and a lot of people don't know this, but a lot of doctors have  to keep track of in an insurance model where Medicare is paying, you have to there's all  these performance indicators, little checkboxes that you got to match for each visit, like  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:19):**  you know, for a while there, you had to ask everybody about whether they had guns in the  home because that was somehow important to their health.  Yeah, right.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:27):**  And you know, and if you didn't meet a number, you didn't mark that checkbox on a number  of people, then you didn't meet the meaningful use criteria for Medicare.  And then your reimbursement would go down.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:38):**  Well, at first, they put it out there as a carrot.  So they say, if you meet it, you get this extra bonus.  And then in year three, it won't be a bonus.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:46):**  It'll be a, if you're not meeting it, it's a penalty.  It's a penalty.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:18:51):**  So, so I don't have to listen to what the government wants me to think is meaningful.  What's meaningful is what you and I sit down across from each other and say, all right,  this is just you and I. And it brings the doctor and the patient back together again,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:19:06):**  rather than having that third party influence there.  Because I really don't care what an insurance company thinks is medically necessary.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:19:13):**  Who is a, who is a medical adjuster sitting in an office or around a boardroom or in front  of the computer screen?  Who are they to tell you, the doctor on the scene in the room with the patient, what is  
**[0:19:25-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:19:25):**  or is or isn't medically necessary?  But I can also see the point of it where, you know, they didn't want doctors to be able  to go out and just prescribe a bunch of tests, prescribe a bunch of drugs so they could line  
**[0:19:38-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:19:38):**  their pockets.  The insurance company has to, they got to control their costs.  But the insurance company, who's their real customer now?  
**[0:19:47-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:19:47):**  Well, their customer is the government because the government's underwriting all this in  the ACA.  And I mean, I try not to get horribly political on this podcast.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:20:00):**  But you know, when you put government in charge of anything, there's no accountability for  the product and the quality always goes down and the cost will do nothing but go up.  Yeah.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:20:09):**  So it's funny, the DPC model, so Direct Primary Care, Josh Umber, who's probably one of the  most well recognized DPC doctors in the country, he's been on Hannity's show and he speaks  a lot and he helps a lot of practices set this model up.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:20:26):**  And he and I were on a kind of a roundtable discussion with some people who were running  for office and their goal was to see could DPC somehow help Medicaid?  So Medicaid is our welfare system and it's going broke, right?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:20:42):**  Just doesn't have enough money in the system.  And Josh had basically shown them that like, hey, with the typical and I think at that  time he was charging $50 a month with a $50 a month capitated rate for every Medicaid  
**[0:20:54-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:20:54):**  patient in the system.  Here's the care you could deliver.  And they would have made money by doing that they would have saved I don't remember how  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:03):**  many million but it was it was a big number.  But they couldn't wrap their heads around the simplicity of it.  That's what it is with so many.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:10):**  I had so many times that people came into my business and asked if I took insurance.  I do massage.  And I've noticed what you're talking about from day one.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:21):**  In the beginning when I started I think there were people in Kansas a lot that worked for  chiropractors that did take insurance for massage, but it's very rare now very rare  because massage is not regulated in Kansas, which is amazing.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:35):**  Because I don't have anybody breathing down my neck about how I do my job and I never  have an Oklahoma change regulations not a year ago.  And there are so many rules around what sort of massage someone can practice now that they  
**[0:21:49-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:49):**  can't do their job.  And then they're now being asked to take insurance on top of that and it totally takes away from  the quality of patient is what it does.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:21:59):**  And that's the first thing that I have really changed about my business since I stopped  working as many hours is I've kind of kept my quality customers that are there because  they want to be there.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:22:10):**  They're there once a month and they go do the things that I teach them when they leave  and you don't get that over the time at all.  Well I think a fundamental misunderstanding people have is they think that health insurance  
**[0:22:23-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:22:23):**  is healthcare and health insurance is not healthcare.  So when we say the Affordable Care Act, they were trying to make insurance affordable,  but what happened is it drove the price up of everything because that complexity is now  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:22:36):**  there.  So yeah, I think you got to separate what healthcare is from health insurance.  Health insurance is they're trying to insure against a loss and there's a claim that has  
**[0:22:46-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:22:46):**  to be filed and then you have to have so many points of documentation to be able to justify  what you're charging the insurance company.  And then oftentimes they'll fight you over it.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:22:55):**  They'll tell you, oh, you can't order that test.  You can order this test.  And it's been an incredible experience just to get completely away from that.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:02):**  I always kind of smile whenever I see the medical management magazine come in that talks  about the latest thing that people are trying to figure out how to wrap their heads around  from a regulatory standpoint.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:13):**  I'm just like, I don't even have to read that article.  Yeah, but that's so relieving.  It's not even funny.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:18):**  Yeah, it's been very freeing.  And like I said, I think this is a model that people are aching for because people are tired  of that seven minute visit.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:26):**  We started using, I don't know, Atlas in Wichita.  I don't know, like 15 years ago probably for a while.  And the reason I used it is because I was 30, couldn't afford health care and couldn't  
**[0:23:39-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:39):**  afford health insurance and still needed health care.  And it was, I spent 50 bucks a month, I think 65 for my daughter and I for four years probably.  And that provided the majority of everything needed honestly.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:23:52):**  Yeah, it's amazing when you look at the costs of things.  I mean, we were ordering like a CT scan.  If you ran it through your insurance, it would be two or three thousand dollars and with  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:05):**  cash you can buy a CT scan for 250 or 300 dollars.  I started shopping around for my tests.  I actually remember doing that for a while.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:12):**  And then the other thing is that people don't take into consideration, I imagine from either  standpoint is like if you offer to give somebody a CT for free, they're going to go get six  of them.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:21):**  And then you end up with like hypochondriacs that want tests for everything and that's  because they're free.  They're free.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:27):**  They're free.  It's not coming out of their pocketbook.  That's a really good point actually.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:30):**  And I think that's something that direct primary care helps control in a very natural way is,  you know, I'll sit down with someone and say, okay, I think I think we need to get an MRI  of your knee.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:39):**  And they're like, well, how much will that cost?  Well, we can get one for about four or five hundred bucks.  And they go, you know, maybe I'll maybe I'll work with that physical therapist you were  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:46):**  talking about.  Maybe I don't need to get an MRI here today.  But if some if I said, an MRI, you're not paying anything for it.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:52):**  They're like, all right, sure.  Absolutely.  I'll go and get that done.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:55):**  So you give people control of their own health.  They're willing to take control of it.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:24:59):**  Yeah.  So but the you know, the problem is that you can't know what the prices are.  And I ran into this problem in the surgical world.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:04):**  I mean, I do colonoscopies, you know, screening for colon cancer.  And that's still a procedure I enjoy doing.  But what was difficult was about that procedure is that you have four entities involved in  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:16):**  doing a colonoscopy.  So you got to have a surgery center to do it.  So they got to get their fee.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:21):**  You have to have an anesthesiologist unless you want to be awake for your colonoscopy.  Most people do not want to be awake for that.  Do you enjoy them more when the patient is awake when they're asleep?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:30):**  You said you enjoy colonoscopy.  I do.  I know that's probably I probably should say why.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:34):**  I think I enjoy it because it's a it's a different part of my brain that I get to use.  So I get to use my hands.  You know, I'm working the dials, the controls.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:44):**  And it's it's a there is a finite.  I know there's a beginning and there's an end.  And you're either going to find something or you're not.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:25:53):**  Right.  So and so if you find something, you can have a pathology fee.  And so then you have, of course, the fee, my fee for doing the procedure so that, you  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:01):**  know, I could I could come up with my fee fine.  But the problem is I couldn't tell the patient.  Well, here's how much the anesthesiologist is going to be.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:08):**  Here's what the surgery center is going to be.  So that led me to create another business called Fair Market Health, which is a whole  nother business that I started to bundle all those fees together.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:20):**  So that someone could say, well, I know I need a colonoscopy.  I'm just going to go in and pay for that colonoscopy and it'll include everything that needs to  be a part of that.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:29):**  And so we now have, I don't know, over 100 procedures on fair market health.  And it's basically a marketplace for the cash cash patient.  And what's remarkable is businesses are beginning to find out about fair market health because  
**[0:26:40-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:40):**  they're the ones that are really absorbing most of the brunt of this expansion in cost.  I bet your colleagues appreciate it, too.  Well, yeah, the surgeons who are like the surgeons who sign up for fair market health,  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:26:53):**  they what they like about it is the simplicity when they see a patient who's coming from  fair market health.  Like I had to have knee surgery three months ago.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:00):**  I tore my ACL doing something dumb on a dirt bike.  And that'll happen.  It happens.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:05):**  Yeah.  And, you know, even though I have insurance, I was like, I want to see what I can see what  the price is through the marketplace.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:14):**  And when I did the math, I would have spent more money had I gone through my deductible  and then paid my 80-20 copay.  I would have spent more than I did when I just paid the surgeon directly.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:26):**  And what the surgeon have told us is that when they see a fair market health patient  on their schedule, they love it because you know what?  That means they're already getting paid.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:35):**  They don't have to fight for it.  They don't have to call an insurance company.  They don't have to see if there's, you know, what's less admin work in the office.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:43):**  Totally less admin.  It allows them to do what they really love doing.  I think that's surgery.  
**[0:27:47-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:27:47):**  I think that's what the ACA really created was a lot of admin work and a lot of paperwork.  Oh, look at the expansion and just oversight costs and hospitals and look at how much the  C suite of most, most of these large hospital systems are just administrator after administrator  
**[0:28:01-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:01):**  after administrator.  I mean, it's like they're the biggest employer, I think, in Medicine Lodge, actually.  And it's not like that we have, we actually don't have any doctors currently.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:11):**  There's two that are coming.  But there's probably like six administrators.  Yeah, six administrators.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:16):**  And so that means they're working that one or two doctors like a rented mule.  A lot of it is admin.  And you know, it's because of all the garbage they have to go through to get paid.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:25):**  And it's a mess to pay.  And I can't imagine why anybody would want to subject themselves to eight or 10 years  of medical school to come out to be ridden, heard on by, you know, a four year degree  
**[0:28:37-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:37):**  holder that's the admin that's making more money than you telling you how to do your  job.  I can't imagine that that that's an appealing prospect for a new resident.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:46):**  Yeah, it's interesting.  So one of the doctors we hired, he was a hospitalist.  So I mean, he just took care of patients in a hospital.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:28:54):**  He's a Navy guy, too.  And he, you know, he was kind of talking about like, what his day involved and it was, it  was very little patient contact.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:04):**  It was mostly paperwork.  And so yeah, you've taken the most well educated person in the medical system and turn them  into a clerical position.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:12):**  I mean, he has to sit down at a computer and enter in each order he wants to order and  he has to do all the documentation himself.  And what other industry do you take the person who, who knows the most in that industry or  
**[0:29:23-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:23):**  has achieved the highest level of training and then go make them do the entry level data  entry work that makes you hate your job.  Oh, totally.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:32):**  Like the part that that would be the worst for me and I imagine you've gotten to see  some change in this is that you don't get to see the results of your work.  Like when you go to work, you don't go and build a house and then leave and be able to  
**[0:29:44-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:44):**  be like, Hey, honey, look, we built that house and see what you've created.  But when you have time with your patient, you actually get to see the results and that's  rewarding instead of going to an office and doing office work that would to me that has  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:29:58):**  to be like, right, ruining doctors.  Yeah.  So it's, it's made, you know, the documentation we do in the office is much simpler now because  
**[0:30:04-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:04):**  we're documenting for what we need to know for that patient, you know, much like you're  taking field notes.  You know, I mean, if you can imagine if the government was making was overseeing everything  
**[0:30:14-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:14):**  you're doing, you had to track every inch that you walked and you had to justify every  wire that you moved and I would not tolerate that.  I mean, and you know, you kind of think about like an oil, something simple like an oil  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:26):**  change.  Imagine if we used our car insurance to go get oil changes.  So you can imagine how the conversation goes.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:31):**  You come in and they go, well, you're going to need this oil change.  Now your manufacturer recommends that you have a 10 30 synthetic, but unfortunately  your insurance is only going to pay for 10 40 non synthetic.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:41):**  So we're going to have to call and get an approval, you know, the prior, the dreaded  prior authorization and then they, that oil change.  And then they come back.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:50):**  What said, well, the price we're going to charge your insurance is $140, but we're going  to negotiate that down to 20 down to a hundred and your copay is only 20.  Right.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:30:59):**  And for, for oil that probably costs 15.  Yeah, exactly.  So, yeah, so you can see that like if you just did that with just the oil change industry,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:07):**  oil changes are going to get more expensive, right?  Because you've just added a bunch of complexity to something that didn't need to be that complex.  So we're supposed, we were making it more affordable though.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:18):**  Right.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:21):**  Yeah.  Have we depressed everybody?  I don't know.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:25):**  I mean, I think there's that you guys would be surprised going back to the five year old  thing, how many grown adults that pay for health insurance don't have a clue how, not  only how the system actually works today, but why it works the way it does and how it  
**[0:31:39-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:39):**  got there and why things do cost so much because people want to blame their doctor right away  or they want to blame any one thing and it's not any one thing.  It's the whole regulatory thing as a whole.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:48):**  And there are reasons that things are so expensive and there are reasons that your insurance  doesn't want to pay for stuff and people don't see the root of the problem.  They want to pill this problem too, really.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:31:57):**  Well, and in the end, you know, that, that month that we opened that Obamacare became  law of the land, that actually ended up being the best thing for our business because now  there are all these people who had health insurance and they went to their doctor and  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:09):**  they got something done and then they got the bill and they're like, wait a minute,  I have health insurance.  And the doctor's like, yeah, and you have a deductible for $5,000 and like a deductible  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:18):**  what?  Yeah.  You know?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:21):**  And so now that people are like, well, how much does it cost for me to get a strep throat  test?  We don't know.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:25):**  That's the other thing.  They don't know.  People are asking questions now though.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:28):**  You know, the number one reason to be admitted to the hospital in the United States is to  have a baby.  Call the hospital and ask them, Hey, how much does it cost to have a baby?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:36):**  Nobody will know.  Nobody knows.  But if you do get an answer, it's going to be completely different from the other hospitals  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:41):**  that are in the same area.  It'll be like seven to $75,000.  My brain, our eye surgery and my tonsil surgery were two good examples.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:49):**  So I had my tonsils out a few years ago and had no health insurance.  Couldn't afford to pay for it all at once.  I couldn't go to the surgery center because I had to make payments and they wanted their  
**[0:32:58-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:32:58):**  money out the front.  So my doctor scheduled it at the hospital because they would let me make payments there.  By the time it was all said and done, I think all four people that I had to pay was over  
**[0:33:11-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:11):**  $14,000 for a tonsillectomy and a polyp taken off my vocal cords.  It was really simple surgery.  I was in the hospital from like 9 15 was gone by noon.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:21):**  I think probably Brian had an eye surgery two or three years ago.  That was the torn and detached retina.  And it was pretty complicated.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:29):**  I think when it was all said and done, it was less than $3,000 but paid cash for it  all.  So we paid cash.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:36):**  I had a deal with the surgeon.  My surgeon, I'll tell you who it is later.  You probably know him.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:42):**  So we had a deal and all I had to pay was for the clinic time and the anesthesiologist.  And my cash price was like so low.  And I was like, well, how much would you all charge the insurance company?  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:33:54):**  And he told me.  And it was 10%.  I ended up paying 10% of what they would have charged the insurance company.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:01):**  So I was like, okay, walk me through this.  How does this work?  He says, okay, well, we take and we submit this big bill, which is kind of high to the  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:08):**  insurance company.  They say, we're not going to pay that.  You need to knock it down.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:13):**  And then we go back and forth two or three times until we finally get to the number that  they're actually going to pay, which is going to be somewhere around here, which is what  you're paying.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:21):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the reality is he would do that cash price all day long, every day.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:26):**  And that wasn't charity care, right?  What he charged you was what we, that's why we called it fair market health.  That's the fair market price.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:33):**  The price is out there somewhere, right?  I mean, if you just let the market do what it'll do, we'll start to see prices fall down.  Which is people asking the questions and people insisting on transparency.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:44):**  Do you guys know how they establish prices in the hospital system?  Speaking of your tonsillectomy?  I have no idea.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:49):**  No, I'd love to know.  I would assume has something to do with medic Medicare.  So Medicare sets the basement.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:34:57):**  Medicare you can't go below Medicare.  So Medicare is basically the threshold that no one can fall below.  So no, the way they do this is they have this thing called a master charge sheet.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:05):**  And let's say tonsillectomy is one of the line items on that master charge sheet.  Okay, the top of that charge sheet, each column is going to be who their payers are.  They're gonna have Aetna, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, you know, Cigna.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:17):**  Are you telling me they have a sheet where they charge different providers different  dollar amounts for the same procedure on the same patient?  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:26):**  Hold on.  I want to hear this all the way through.  Yep.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:29):**  Yep, exactly right.  So they charge different amounts to each one of those carriers.  Okay, because that's a negotiated price.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:34):**  Now of course, they're not going to publish that, right?  Because that would be a trade secret or, you know, that would, you'd see how the sausage  was made then.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:42):**  A trade secret, that's more like criminal behavior almost.  It feels a little bit like it.  But what's remarkable is that then they look at the year and they go, okay, well, how much  
**[0:35:51-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:35:51):**  did we actually get paid, right?  Because you talk about that negotiation back and forth and they'll say, oh, well, Aetna  paid 65% of what we wanted and Blue Cross Blue Shield only paid 50% and then Cigna,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:02):**  oh, Cigna paid 100%.  Guess what the price does the next year?  Goes up.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:07):**  Goes up.  To the Cigna price.  Yep.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:10):**  They just raise everything up to there.  And so now, you know, then it's all done on percentages.  And so Blue Cross Blue Shield as, you know, makes you as a business owner feel really  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:17):**  good.  They're like, well, we're getting you a discount.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:21):**  We're getting you a percentage off.  But a percentage off of what?  It's a percentage off of a made up number.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:27):**  The percentage off of an extremely inflated price that they won't tell you what it's really  worth in the first place.  They'll just tell you that, oh, we're giving you a good deal on it because we're giving  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:36):**  you 50% off.  Here's the really dirty secret.  They don't know the price.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:42):**  The hospital doesn't know how much it actually costs to do something in their hospital.  Because think about it.  If they've charged these really inflated fees, they have to spread those costs out over other  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:36:53):**  cost centers in their business.  So I use an example.  And I imagine there's some just cost sinks in the hospital that aren't going to generate  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:00):**  revenue no matter what.  They have to be accounted for.  So one of the cost sinks is when you get a new physician on, you have to credential them.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:06):**  And that means you've got to sign them up for all the third party payers.  And you've got to do a lot of paperwork essentially.  So when I was an independent provider, I would go.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:13):**  I'm assuming all that paperwork is mandated by the government.  Well, some of it probably is through Medicare.  But it's also just insurance companies.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:22):**  It's just part of their thing for signing up for them.  You're going to have to fill all this stuff out.  And then you've got to make sure that you're keeping regular on everything.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:28):**  So I would pay someone $500 a year to do that for me.  Probably totally worth it.  Yeah, it was totally worth it because I don't want to spend that time doing that.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:36):**  I hate doing paperwork.  So that was money well spent.  In a hospital system, so $500 to credential one physician for a year.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:44):**  In the hospital, they did their credentialing in-house.  It was $37,000 to credential a physician for a year.  Your eyeballs just got really big.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:53):**  You're like, how could it cost $37,000?  It doesn't.  They don't do cost.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:37:58):**  Like when you have a restaurant, you know how much that plate of french fries cost,  including dishes and server and all that stuff.  They don't do that is what you're saying.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:06):**  Right.  And you know how much dawn dish liquid you're going to have to use to clean the plate.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:11):**  But in hospitals, they've lost track of what the real costs of everything are inside  their own system.  But I suppose then there's the argument to be made of when somebody's in the table  
**[0:38:26-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:26):**  in the ER and they're bleeding out and their vitals are crashing, nobody's going  to dicker over the cost of a frickin' Tylenol.  It's fix the guy, get him stable, get him alive.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:38):**  We don't care what it costs.  And is that the mentality that's just infected the rest of the industry?  Like we don't need to tell you what it costs.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:46):**  We're just going to make you better and you can pay us later.  Yeah.  It's, I mean, if you think about the insurance game, it's really, you're signing a blank  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:53):**  check.  Yeah.  Right.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:38:56):**  And I mean, to the…  Oh, when you walk into the ER, you're basically giving them your checkbook.  Right.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:01):**  Yeah.  And you know, to the credit of ERs, I mean, I don't want to make it just bash on the  American medical system.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:06):**  But one thing that we're really good at in the United States is if you have, you know,  a catastrophic injury out on your ranch, right?  You can get to the ER within an hour.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:17):**  Chances of surviving are very high here in the United States.  We're really good at taking care of…  Yeah.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:23):**  I'm not worried about a common cold.  Like you just laid out my scenario right there.  Getting hurt and being able to get to the hospital in an hour.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:30):**  Those are my two problems.  Right.  Well, critical care in this part of the country is less than other places, but it's still  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:35):**  outstanding.  It's outstanding.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:38):**  I mean, you know, the fact that someone could be having a heart attack and in 30 minutes  be in a cath lab with a balloon inflating that opens that artery back up.  That's the miracle of modern medicine.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:46):**  Like that stuff really is amazing.  And it takes a lot of, you know, money and development to do that.  But the…  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:53):**  Emergency medicine doesn't necessarily go into play with this the same way either, does  it?  Well, and I think, you know, there's inappropriate use of emergency rooms.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:39:59):**  Somebody's like, well, I have a headache and my doctor's office can't get me in  today.  So I'll just go into the ER.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:04):**  Yeah.  I've seen and watched that scenario play out.  I don't know how many times.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:12):**  And I almost kind of hesitate to tell this little anecdote because she'll know who  I'm talking about.  But that's fine.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:20):**  She's already mad at me anyway.  And she's not in this room.  There's a woman I used to know that had three boys and they were all in sports.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:29):**  And she had a good job working for, let's just say, a power utility.  So a good, sweet union job with a union negotiated health plan working for the power utility.  Okay.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:40):**  You following me so far?  So basically a public, you know, public employee union that has unlimited power to shut things  down if they really, really wanted to flex that strike muscle.  
**[0:40:50-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:40:50):**  So they negotiated a really sweet health plan for, you know, all the employees and their  dependents.  And it was a pretty low copay and pretty high coverage limits.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:01):**  So this lady would take her kids, just like you said, get us in the flood at eight o'clock  at night.  Let's go to the hospital.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:07):**  Let's go to the emergency room.  Hang on a second.  I thought it was no hospital trips on the weekends and then you better either be bleeding,  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:14):**  dying or have a bone sticking out of your body.  Other than that, we are not going.  You can make an appointment.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:21):**  And I think that's some of the way, that's kind of how we got off the rails in a lot  of this is, you know, unions use their muscle to force, you know, large companies into these  sweetheart health plans that are like, yep, you go to the emergency room, you know, you  
**[0:41:37-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:37):**  only have to pay $200 a month for your part of it.  Low deductible, great, because that's what you wanted in order to keep the production  lines at General Motors working for another five years.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:46):**  And then other industries get that.  You know, the teachers unions get that.  The firefighters unions get that.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:51):**  The police unions get that.  Yes, I like to pick on unions.  Don't judge me too harshly, but that's what they do.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:41:57):**  They use their, you know, their large collective bargaining power to break the arms of these  companies.  And then we get into a situation like we got now, that everybody's got to have health care  
**[0:42:06-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:06):**  and it's super expensive.  And when you go to the hospital, they're super long waits for substandard care from a doctor  that treats you like an abs, that just treats you like a number and a file, doesn't know  
**[0:42:17-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:17):**  a thing about you.  So my personal experience, like I've been trying to find a doctor that I can get a long  with for two years.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:29):**  I went to one and like you said, like I'm not even sure I got seven and a half minutes.  It was maybe more like three or four.  She asked a few basic questions, asked what was wrong with me and then ordered a whole  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:42):**  bunch of blood tests.  I'm like, what do you want this blood test for?  And she gave me a list and is like, anything else?  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:47):**  I guess not.  And then she was gone.  I'm not even sure I got seven and a half minutes of her time.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:42:53):**  She didn't ask me a thing about how I slept, didn't ask me how I ate, didn't ask about  my activity level, didn't ask how much water I drank.  You think I went back to her?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:00):**  Yeah.  Did she didn't ask you about your purpose in life?  No, she didn't ask that either.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:05):**  But she wanted a whole bunch of tests and the tests, like I called over to the hospital  and was like, okay, I got these, these, you know, I got all these tests from this doctor.  How much is that going to cost?  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:13):**  And it was over a thousand dollars of blood tests, a thousand dollars of blood tests.  You didn't even ask me how much water I've had to drink or you didn't ask him about my  eating habits.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:21):**  She didn't ask the most important question first, which was, do you have health insurance  and how high is your deductible?  Because if your deductible was really low, you would have never asked.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:31):**  Yeah.  That's, that's probably true too.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:34):**  I mean, again, that goes back to why I really love the direct primary care model is that  it brings that relationship back to you and me and talking about, well, here, you know,  I'd be like, well, Brian, I don't know what's going on, but you know, I think these tests  
**[0:43:45-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:45):**  will help us figure it out.  But the cool thing with DPC is that, you know, those blood tests would have been a fraction  of that price.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:53):**  Right.  Right.  And so, I mean, for our members, we do a CBC, a CMP, a vitamin D, an omega three, a TSH,  
**[0:43:59-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:43:59):**  a PSA, an insulin and an A1C on every one of our patients.  Only about three of those were in actual English that any of our listeners are going to understand,  doc.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:10):**  They can pause it and rewind.  But that whole panel, we just include that in the price of the membership because that  helps us take better care of you.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:17):**  We don't even want you to think about the cost of that lab panel.  And then, you know, like a vitamin D test, you know, another practice, if you had to  pay cash for it, it was $235.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:28):**  At our place, it's like $30.  Do you do some of those in-house or do you guys have a place where you contract with  those?  
**[0:44:34-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:34):**  Yeah, no, most of our labs we send through LabCorp, but we send our cardiovascular panel  goes to Quest, which is Cleveland Heart is who is partnered there.  And we have a few specialty labs that we use that are kind of harder to find stuff.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:48):**  If I wanted to measure how much glyphosate's in you, I can't do that through LabCorp.  I'd have to do that through.  You can do that?  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:53):**  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:44:56):**  Ooh.  That's like, can you do it to my cows?  That's a can of worms.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:02):**  That is a can of worms right there.  How much glyphosate is in you?  Why are we able to measure glyphosate in humans?  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:06):**  Well, I mean, the science says that...  It's totally safe.  The science says it's totally safe.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:11):**  I mean, glyphosate is totally safe.  It's not toxic or harmful to human beings.  You won't find it in humans because there's no chance that that glyphosate residue can  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:19):**  ever be in human tissue.  And it won't make it to the food.  It doesn't make it to the food.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:23):**  It's perfectly safe.  Trust the science.  Trust the science.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:26):**  So, okay, so answer this one for me.  Why is it that we can measure glyphosate in a box of Cheerios?  Cheerios are made with oats, right?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:34):**  Yeah.  Oats aren't GMO and sprayed with round...  There's no Roundup ready oats, are there?  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:39):**  I've never heard of any.  No, but I guarantee you there's a field that's been sprayed with Roundup and then planted  to oats six months later.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:45):**  Or the year before on that oat field, they grew a crop that they burned...  They grew a cover crop or they had weeds that they burned down with glyphosate and then  maybe planted their oats into that.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:45:56):**  I mean, there's a lot of crops that are probably full of it that are not Roundup ready.  So this kind of brings us around to what we're talking about is that when my...  I started being fascinated with this, not just glyphosate, but also just the idea of  
**[0:46:08-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:08):**  soil.  We talk about our natural resources.  And once I started learning about soil and what's wrong with our food, you start saying  
**[0:46:16-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:16):**  like you said, what's causing that, what's causing that, what's causing...  You said you were gonna be the one to ask what, what, what.  So when you start asking that, well, why isn't our food good for us?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:26):**  Why isn't it healthy anymore?  And then you start going down and at some point you get to soil.  You do.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:33):**  You always get to soil.  It always comes to soil.  So what's interesting is I started seeing in my patients who are farmers, because I  
**[0:46:40-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:40):**  love talking to farmers.  It's something I'm probably a farmer at heart.  Like if I wasn't a doctor, I think I'd probably be doing something like what you're doing.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:47):**  I think the world needs you where you are.  Well, so I talked to my farmers and I'd ask them like, well, what are you doing?  Well, I gotta go buy some chemicals today.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:46:58):**  And they're like, oh, how much are you gonna spend?  Oh, I'm gonna write $130,000 check to spray on my fields tomorrow.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:06):**  So what I, what I realized is, oh, you guys are having the same thing happen in your industry  that happened in my industry.  You were convinced.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:15):**  Pill for a problem.  Exactly.  Yep.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:18):**  There's a pill for your problem.  It's like that at school too.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:21):**  There's a chemical for that problem.  We can just throw more chemicals at it.  Microwave ovens, man.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:24):**  That's what did it.  Like everybody got microwaved and they wanted everything fast, like right away.  So one of my, one of my patients is his, his business is just consulting with farmers  
**[0:47:32-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:32):**  and letting them know here's what you're going to need to spray this year.  And so I asked him, I said, so what's, what is it you're telling people this year?  And he goes, well, we're using a combination of four chemicals now.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:40):**  I said, what was it the year before?  It was three.  And before that, we could get by with two in most cases.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:44):**  I'm like, where does this go?  He's like, it's not pretty.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:49):**  What's the end game here?  What's the end game?  Like collapse at some point.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:54):**  Yeah.  Well, I mean, at some point I think you're going to find that there's just going to be  farmers who can't write that check.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:47:58):**  Right.  That's what I mean.  That's what's going to happen this year.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:01):**  This year.  Yeah.  Because of fuel prices, because of what fertilizer prices because of all of that.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:08):**  So hopefully what happens, those farmers do the same thing that happened to me seven,  eight years ago.  And I was like, I got to figure out a different way to do this.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:15):**  This isn't going to work.  This isn't going to work.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:18):**  This is not sustainable for me.  And so that's what really got me interested in this conversation of connecting with farmers  and listening to them.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:24):**  And, and now I try to convert them.  Like if I know they're a spray, I call them spray farmers, but that might be.  Probably a really polite word.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:31):**  Yeah.  So if I can, if I get a spray farmer, I'm like, Hey, have you looked into regenerative  farming?  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:36):**  That's crazy.  He says, that's crazy.  You're crazy.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:39):**  You're a doctor.  You don't know anything about farming.  Some of them get some, I can either get one or two reactions.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:42):**  They get really hot under the collar.  Or they think it's cute probably.  And they're like, why are you telling me this?  
**[0:48:47-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:47):**  That regenerative crap doesn't work.  Yeah.  Or, or they say, you know, I've been hearing about this.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:48:54):**  It's interesting that you bring that up.  Right.  And so that again, it goes back to, like I said, the two different kinds of doctors.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:00):**  When they have it, they go, this, this is, this resonates with me somehow.  I want to learn more.  Look when you, when you're sitting around the coffee shop and you're hearing one guy  
**[0:49:07-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:07):**  say regenerative agriculture, and then six of your buddies are going out of that crap  doesn't work.  Just keep, keep spraying it away.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:14):**  You don't spray the, spray the weeds away.  And then he comes into your office and you're like, and you start talking about regenerative  agriculture.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:21):**  That's a light bulb for that farmer.  I guarantee you that's a light bulb.  Well, especially when he says I have a test that can check how much glyphosate's in your  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:28):**  body.  How many takers do you have on that?  Do you do that?  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:33):**  I mean, really?  It's, I mean, it's a test.  I, we do probably 10 to 12 of them a year.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:38):**  So it's not a one I, I probably should, to be honest, I probably should do it.  I want you to test yourself.  Yeah, I probably should.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:43):**  There's a lab, there's a lab, the lab that does this testing is in Kansas.  Great Plains lab, great, wonderful business.  They do some really cool labs.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:51):**  Okay.  So since we're on the subject, like have you ever gotten one of those glyphosate tests  back and gone, holy shit, why is this guy alive?  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:49:59):**  Oh yeah, there's, well, and it's not just glyphosate, there's a lot of environmental  toxins.  So I mean, again, we kind of talk about our pillars of health.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:06):**  It's like the elimination step.  Some people can eliminate things very efficiently, like their liver can get rid of it.  It can, or their, their skin can sweat it out or they can poop it out, pee it out.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:15):**  And some people can't.  I mean, genetically, they just aren't designed to be able to handle some of these molecules.  And so, you know, when we're dealing with difficult problems, sometimes we have to dig  
**[0:50:23-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:23):**  down really deep and go, okay, what are we missing?  Like let's start looking for these toxicants or potential toxicants is what I call them.  So yeah, it's like, it's like finding lead.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:31):**  You know, in the United States, we, we say a lead of, a lead of one in a kid is considered  the upper range of normal.  Well, the World Health Organization in every other country, they go, no, lead needs to  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:42):**  be zero in a kid.  Right.  So why are we allowing it to be up to one?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:47):**  Because if it was, if it was up to one, if we allowed it, then, then nobody would drink  any water probably.  We'd probably,  
**[0:50:53-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:50:53):**  Well, there'd be a lot of lawsuits for lead based paint.  Yeah, well, we can, we can also just define a way of problem.  So it's like, like we talked about how they've changed a lot of definitions.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:03):**  A lot of definitions have changed this year if you've been paying attention.  The last two years.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:08):**  So, you know, you can, you can make a whole lot of people have hyperlipidemia, which is  high cholesterol by changing the number.  Just saying, okay, now normal cholesterol is 75.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:17):**  We don't want anybody to have a cholesterol over 75.  Well, guess what?  Now, most of your patient population is going to be hyperlipidemic.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:24):**  Now cows are bad.  Oh man, don't get me started on the,  If you want to get started, like back all the way up to the fifties with the big sugar  
**[0:51:33-0:51:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:33):**  lie and start there.  Yeah, no, I think it's a great place to start because actually there, there was a paper  that was written by a guy, well Ansel Keys came out with his study and at the same time  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:44):**  Ansel Keys came out with his study that said fat was bad for you.  Fat causes heart disease.  Right.  
**[0:51:49-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:51:49):**  I think this was after, was it Eisenhower had his heart attack or maybe it,  I think it was Eisenhower had his heart attack and that's what made everybody aware.  That's what got everybody thinking about heart disease and why did this happen to a healthy  
**[0:52:01-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:01):**  guy that was in his fifties and  So at the same time that Ansel Keys published his study, which by the way, he completely  cherry picked all the data, right?  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:09):**  Surprise.  I know.  So it's kind of like those soil guys were out at your property today.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:12):**  If you knew where like the best richest soil was and you said, I only want you to look  here, don't look in any of these other places.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:19):**  That's why they didn't let me pick the soil.  That's why they didn't let me pick the points.  I know where I've got some good dirt.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:23):**  Ansel Keys was saying, well, in countries where they eat a lot of animal fat, they have  higher rates of heart disease.  But what he left out was all the places where they eat a high level animal fat and they  
**[0:52:32-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:32):**  have really low heart disease.  So about the same time that that paper came out, there's another scientist wrote a paper  called Sugar the White Devil.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:40):**  It's a very provocative name.  You know, they had a lot more ingenuity when they named their studies back then.  And it was basically talking about how sugar is really one of the fundamental problems.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:50):**  Right.  And it's interesting.  You can look at the development of diabetes in the ancient world.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:52:55):**  So when you start seeing diabetes, the description of diabetes as a disease show up in the ancient  world, it followed the same path that sugarcane industry followed across the globe.  Okay.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:06):**  By 10 years.  So about 10 years after sugarcane showed up, you'd start seeing cases of diabetes.  The final we're talking about when we say diabetes, because there's type one, which  
**[0:53:13-0:53:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:13):**  is the genetic diabetes and type two, which is dietary brought on.  Yeah.  So I would put a finer point on it and say that type one is where your pancreas cannot  
**[0:53:23-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:23):**  make insulin.  So you've lost, there's a beta cell in the islet cells of your pancreas that makes insulin.  In a type one diabetic, they've had an autoimmune attack.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:33):**  So their immune system attacked those beta cells, destroyed them.  They can't produce insulin.  So those people need insulin to live.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:39):**  Right.  So that's type one.  Type two is exactly the opposite problem.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:43):**  A type two diabetic is making massive amounts of insulin.  And that's mostly what we're talking about is a type two diabetes.  Or what I like to call diabesity, right?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:52):**  Because it often goes hand in hand with obesity.  I see what you did there.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:53:57):**  Diabesity.  So, so yeah, that, you know, we, we got off the rails and I have a presentation that I  give that I use the CDC map for obesity.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:07):**  And I can't remember what year, but there's a, I think in 2014, they stopped taking this  data.  But what they did is they did a phone survey for like 15 or 20 years and they would just  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:17):**  call and ask somebody your height and your weight.  So they were calculating BMI, which is body mass index.  This is a useless number.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:23):**  It's a useless number, but it's, it's at least a number.  Okay.  And so these are self-reported.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:28):**  So you know how most people are 100% accurate.  Yeah.  It's going to be the same weight that's on their driver's license.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:33):**  100% accuracy there.  But what's interesting is to watch what happened to the map of the United States and obesity  and obesity.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:41):**  At the time when they started the survey, there was no states that had greater than  10% obese patients.  Okay.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:47):**  And this presentation I give the map just keeps changing colors and they have to add  a new category, a new category, a new category.  Now we were up to the point where I don't think we have a single state that has less  
**[0:54:56-0:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:54:56):**  than 40% obesity.  So we went from not having a state that was over 10 to not having a state that's not over  40% obesity.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:04):**  That's interesting.  I thought by getting rid of all the animal fat in our diet that we'd all get skinnier.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:10):**  That, that's, that's what, that was the lie they told us, right?  Is that, oh, these dietary fats and cholesterol.  And finally this year the American Heart Association removed dietary cholesterol as a nutrient  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:21):**  of concern.  And it didn't, it barely made a splash at all.  Well, yeah, nobody will believe that either because the generation that's older than us,  
**[0:55:29-0:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:29):**  you know, 60 year old people still like live and die by that.  Yeah, we hear low fat, low cholesterol, and we think that's healthy.  Yes.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:36):**  Low fat, low cholesterol is terrible for you.  Isn't the human brain basically just a big lump of fat that is fueled by cholesterol?  Yeah, yeah, no, yeah.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:44):**  Your brain is made up of DHA and cholesterol and lots of fats, a lot of fatty acids in  your brain.  And like it's, it's fueled by, if you don't have the right kind of fatty acids, your brain  
**[0:55:53-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:55:53):**  doesn't work great.  Well, and you can break, you can break food down to basically three macronutrients.  So big nutrient, meaning you can either, a food is either made of fat, it's protein,  
**[0:56:02-0:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:02):**  or it's a carbohydrate or sugar.  Carbohydrates and sugar I'd put in the same category.  Okay.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:08):**  That's what I heard too.  You cannot live without ingesting fat.  You can't live without ingesting protein.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:13):**  You have to bring those in.  Okay.  You actually don't need any carbohydrates.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:18):**  Okay.  So carbohydrates is an unnecessary macronutrient.  Your liver, your liver is number one.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:25):**  A lot of people think the liver's job is to filter out your weekend drinking, right?  You know, we always heard the liver filters the time.  Like you were saying, liver filters toxins.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:34):**  And that's one of the main jobs.  But it's not the main job.  The main job of the liver is to produce glucose.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:43):**  Right.  So how much do you weigh?  Buck eighty?  
**[0:56:48-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:48):**  My driver's license has a hundred and seventy-five pounds, sir.  Okay.  So in an average hundred and eighty pound male, if I could reach into your liver and  
**[0:56:55-0:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:56:55):**  just turn off the switch for gluconeogenesis, you'd be dead in six minutes.  Six minutes.  Six minutes.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:02):**  That's how much glucose your liver is making all the time.  And it's making that glucose from protein and from fat in a process called gluconeogenesis.  And it's not making it from carbohydrates.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:12):**  Not making it from carbohydrates.  So carbohydrates are unnecessary.  They're bonus, right?  
**[0:57:17-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:17):**  So I think when we were hunters and gatherers and we had a massive amount of carbohydrates,  like say you came across a batch of huckleberries.  Right.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:26):**  Then you would, you would engorge yourself, you know, and your satiety signals are different  when you're eating carbohydrates.  Like you get hungrier.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:33):**  Right.  Like Chinese foods syndrome where you can eat and eat and eat and eat.  Eat and feel full, but still 100% hungry when you're done.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:40):**  You still be hungry.  Yeah.  So, you know, that was probably beneficial for us as an organism because what it did  
**[0:57:46-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:46):**  is it spiked our insulin and insulin has two main jobs.  Insulin's main role is putting glucose inside the cell.  The other thing that people don't realize insulin does is insulin creates fat.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:57:57):**  Okay.  So we make fat from glucose.  We convert it to glycerin first and then that goes to a triglyceride and then triglycerides  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:06):**  are stored in fat cells.  Okay.  So that's what happens when you eat a carb.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:10):**  That's what happens when you eat a simple carbohydrate, we should say.  Because I would say there's simple carbohydrates and then there's complex carbohydrates or  fiber would be a better way to put that.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:18):**  Okay.  So then what happens?  So your body takes that carb and has to turn it into fat before it can be used.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:27):**  So what happens when you eat fat and protein?  Well, so your body could use that carbohydrate right away.  So it doesn't necessarily have to.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:35):**  It could break it down to the simple sugar.  Right.  But if you didn't.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:38):**  If it's not used immediately.  If it is.  It goes into storage.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:41):**  It goes into storage.  Right.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:44):**  So yeah.  So your body, the way it's using fat and protein is it's breaking down as constituent  amino acids.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:50):**  It's breaking down constituent fatty acids.  So you've got your alpha linoleic acids.  You've got your EPAs.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:58:57):**  You've got your DHAs.  You've got your long chain fatty acids, your medium chain, your short chain.  So all of those are necessary for energy production.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:07):**  It's necessary to fuel your muscles.  It's necessary to fuel your liver so your liver can now make glucose because glucose  is really important for your brain.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:14):**  But yeah, the big lie back in the, what was it, 35, 40 years ago was that, oh, we need  to stop eating so much fat and cholesterol.  Right.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:26):**  So the fat we store in our body and in short TLDR, the fat we store in our body is not  the same as the fat we eat.  And the fat that we eat from animals is not immediately stored in your body the same way  
**[0:59:38-0:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:38):**  as glucose sugar fat.  So your Twinkie, the Twinkie is not just sugar.  And I think that's kind of one of the myth lie things that people think is that, yeah,  
**[0:59:47-0:59:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:47):**  that sugar you can go and you can burn it off right away.  It is actually stored as fat.  And if you eat an egg that's full of fat, good fats, that does not turn to fat in your  
**[0:59:56-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:56):**  body the same way.  Right.  And it's different satiety signal.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=0:59:59):**  So this is the whole, the other lie is that a calorie is a calorie is a calorie.  You hear this.  It's like, no, you know, a hundred grams of salmon is very different from a hundred grams  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:07):**  of sugar.  Yeah.  It's good.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:10):**  I mean, yes, they're both a hundred grams, but the way you're going to eat.  You could choke down a hundred grams of sugar and not know it.  But if you try to choke down a hundred grams of salmon, you're going to be full.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:18):**  You're going to be full.  Right.  And so, yeah, different hormonal signals in your body have different reactions to different  
**[1:00:23-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:23):**  of those, those macronutrients.  So, so the way I always understood it and kind of like Tonya just, just explained it,  like, okay, I eat that Twinkie.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:33):**  If the energy in that Twinkie, the sugar is more than my body's needs, my liver turns  that into fat and stashes that somewhere in my body.  Right.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:42):**  I mean, the basic 30,000 foot view.  But if I go out and say, I eat a cheeseburger or I just eat a piece of meat or a meat snack  without, without a bunch of carbs and sugar and corn syrup and bread and shit, just, you  
**[1:00:54-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:00:54):**  know, just meat, protein and fat that gets stored in my stomach.  And as my body needs that energy, the liver does that like, like gluconeogenesis.  Thank you for that word.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:09):**  I would never have gotten it.  I would have stumbled over that five gluconeogenesis.  So your body does the gluconeogenesis process on the fats that are still just hanging around  
**[1:01:17-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:17):**  your stomach from that burger patty you ate and turns that into the six minute sugar.  It could be also your stored fat too.  So, so in our, in our practice, we use a lot of therapeutic ketosis.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:29):**  So ketogenic diets.  Have you heard about ketogenic diets?  I have, but probably not everybody listening to this says, tell us what a ketogenic diet  
**[1:01:36-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:36):**  is.  So there's two, two ways of thinking about a ketogenic diet.  There's the classical keto, which was described in the medical literature a hundred years  
**[1:01:43-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:43):**  ago, which is a very, very high fat diet.  It's so much fat that it's almost a gross amount of fat to eat.  And then that, what that would do is that would, that would shift the body into producing  
**[1:01:54-1:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:01:54):**  ketones as a primary fuel source.  So ketones are fatty acids.  What we use is what I would call nutritional ketosis, which is we limit the carbohydrates  
**[1:02:06-1:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:06):**  so that we force the body into that state where it's utilizing and burning fat for fuel.  Trying to gently nudge the body into ketosis instead of just throwing it all the way to  the, throwing it all the way to the far side.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:19):**  Well, and a lot of people who do this feel that thrown all the way to the false.  We call that the carb valley or keto flu.  You feel pretty crappy.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:26):**  If you've lived your whole life on simple carbohydrates and all of a sudden I take them  away from you, you're going to, you're going to, for two weeks, you're going to suffer.  And you're not going to leave the bathroom a whole lot from what I understand.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:35):**  Now some people get constipated.  Yeah, but that usually you can fix that with enough salt and water and fiber and other  stuff.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:41):**  But so ketogenic diets, you know, we use those therapeutically and basically what we're doing  is we're saying limit the amount of carbohydrates that you eat.  So in a typical ketogenic diet, you're going to eat less than 30 net carbs a day.  
**[1:02:52-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:02:52):**  So a net carb is very simply the total carbohydrates and subtracting the fiber.  So we're saying is we're talking about the carbohydrates that actually are generating  insulin.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:01):**  They're having an insulinogenic effect.  Which is the non dietary.  Which is your, you know, just it's basically your sugars.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:07):**  Like if you're, if you sugar starch, things like that.  Yeah.  Right.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:11):**  So like if you take an orange and you eat it, you're getting a lot of fiber and pulp  and stuff that takes your body time to break down.  If you drink orange juice, it's like mainlining the sugar.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:18):**  How much different does your body break down the sugar in say an apple off the tree versus  apple juice that's got corn syrup added?  Oh man.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:28):**  It's not like it's night and day difference.  I mean, if you, if you did a three hour glucose challenge test and measured insulin, it's  an unbelievable, they don't even look like they're in the same food category.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:40):**  Really?  Yeah.  It's literally your, when your liver gets that hit of high fructose corn syrup and concentrated  
**[1:03:47-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:47):**  apple juice, your liver does, it's like your liver goes, where in the world did this come  from?  And it says, well, I'm going to have to make it into fat because he's not, he's not burning  
**[1:03:57-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:03:57):**  any energy right now.  He's sitting here at a table pounding 12 ounce, doing 12 ounce curls.  He doesn't need any energy.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:04):**  Yeah.  So, so you know, we, we tell people in our clinic, we say, you know, drinking fruit juice  is no different than drinking a large Coke.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:13):**  Even if it doesn't have corn syrup attitude, it still goes through your blood system like  crack, right?  It goes through much faster fiber and there's no fiber.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:20):**  It's, it's, it's just, it's slams into your liver and your liver's like, oh my gosh, we  got to take care of this.  So yeah, instead of buying the orange juice, go, just go buy the orange.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:30):**  Right.  So, so then you start packing on fat and then what happens then is you start getting this  fat starts infiltrating your liver.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:37):**  And this is actually one of the most common things we see as people have elevated liver  enzymes used to be, we'd, we called it NAFLD, which is non-alcoholic fatty liver.  Well, why did we call it non-alcoholic fatty liver?  
**[1:04:48-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:04:48):**  Because prior to this time, we only saw it in terrible alcoholics.  So when we saw it and we'd go, oh, this guy obviously drinks a lot.  And then they talked to him and the guy goes, I ain't touched alcohol in 30 years.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:01):**  Oh, well, that's interesting.  Why does your liver look like it?  Why does your liver look like an alcoholic?  
**[1:05:05-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:05):**  So we had to come up with a new category and we called it non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  But we now recognize that that's, that's a steatohepatitis.  So you basically steato meaning fat and then your body's just packing fat.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:18):**  What you're doing is you're making, you're using college level terms.  Tell me what causes it.  Okay.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:23):**  So, but before we say what causes it, let's see how we could create it in an animal.  Okay.  This is a ranching reboot.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:29):**  Yes.  Perfect.  So I don't know.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:32):**  Many of your listeners have heard of foie gras.  Foie gras is French delicacy.  It's a fatty goose pate or duck.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:41):**  Goose liver, right?  It's goose liver.  Yeah.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:44):**  So the fat and they get it fatty by literally stuffing grain down the goose's gullet.  Right.  More than they want to eat.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:05:52):**  So they have a tube and they basically force feed the goose or force feed the duck corn.  So which is just a simple carbohydrate for the most part.  And they overfeed that duck to make fatty liver.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:04):**  So how do we make fatty liver in a human?  It's the same way.  We overfeed grain.  
**[1:06:08-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:08):**  We get too many simple carbohydrates and then the energy expenditure is not there.  You know, if you're a marathon runner, you're going to burn through that energy no problem.  You're not, your body's not going to take time to store it as fat.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:19):**  And just to be clear, we're not just picking on corn farmers here, right?  We're talking about grain period.  Yeah.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:25):**  Just simple carbohydrates, grain, which, you know, most of the simple carbohydrates in  United States come from grain.  And corn because of, I don't know, maybe you'd probably know this better than I would, but  
**[1:06:35-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:35):**  I think it's because of the corn subsidies.  We're growing way more corn than we really need.  There's I mean, it's amazing what you can make corn into.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:44):**  Well, they had to make corn and they had to figure out how to make corn into a lot of  stuff because we had so much.  We had so much.  
**[1:06:51-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:06:51):**  And we had so much in the government, you know, through subsidies and crop insurance  and price controls and, you know, this whole tangled obscene web of bureaucracy, the USDA  and the FDA.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:03):**  You know, they've created all these programs in the name of feeding the world, which is  like this total BS myth.  Like we can't even feed the community.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:13):**  We're sitting in with things that are grown from within a hundred miles of here.  We are not feeding the world.  We're growing a bunch of corn to feed the fricking cows that are standing in a feed  
**[1:07:23-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:23):**  lot that's just the absolute most grossest environment to grow a cow.  Unnatural environment to grow a cow.  Like I think it's 40% of the US corn crop right now goes to ethanol, which is absolute  
**[1:07:38-1:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:38):**  madness in itself.  I mean, you're talking like the reduction in energy value for the price.  It requires more energy and cost to grow, process the corn and turn it into ethanol  
**[1:07:49-1:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:49):**  than you actually get from the ethanol.  It's not saving the environment.  Well, you're adding carbon.  
**[1:07:55-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:07:55):**  You're adding carbon.  You're burning more diesel fuel to create the same amount of road fuel and it contributes  to environmental degradation.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:02):**  But then they can turn around and say, oh, well, we don't have a waste product from that.  Our waste product is these spent distillers grains that we've taken all the alcohol and  all the sugar out of, and we're going to feed that to cows.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:14):**  So that's not a waste product.  That's regenerative, right?  No, no.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:20):**  That's not good for the animal.  It can't be good for the animal.  Even the spent distillers grains with a lot of the carbs and the sugars taken out of them,  
**[1:08:30-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:30):**  well, what's the point of feeding that?  So when you have a concentrated feeding operation like that you find out in Dodge or out in  the western part of Canada.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:38):**  We don't need to pick on any one of them by name.  No, not by name.  There's a bunch of ugly ones.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:44):**  How long does a cow spend in a cave foe?  Well, like, you know, if you're going to finish a fat steer or fat heifer, you're probably  looking at three months on the short end, six months on the long end.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:08:57):**  Okay, so let's say 90 days.  Yeah, I mean, basically the last third or quarter of its life for a production animal.  Yeah, so, well, so what happens at 90 days?  
**[1:09:09-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:09:09):**  I'm imagining that there's a law of diminishing returns that comes in, meaning the longer  you have the animal in the feedlot, the more risk you are of losing the animal to disease.  Because they're, well, I mean, they're stressed out.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:09:24):**  They get to the point where they're so, we talk about this, like we've talked about this  a little bit lately.  This is a can of worms and I'm going to get into it because I kind of got into a little  
**[1:09:32-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:09:32):**  bit on social media by the time this episode comes out on the podcast that social media  thing will be a couple of weeks in the past.  So I think CAFLs are gross.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:09:45):**  They're dying by the time they kill them.  I mean, and yeah, it's not how you would make a healthy cow.  So I take one of my cows, I take one of my steers and I send it to the feedlot.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:09:56):**  Okay.  And he goes there and let's just say that he comes off the risk and he's not classified  high risk so he doesn't get antibiotics off the truck.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:05):**  All right.  Some of them get antibiotics right before they, even before they're in the lot.  I think a large percentage of them and please write in or email me and tell me I'm wrong  
**[1:10:18-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:18):**  and prove it with receipts.  But I've had, I've listened to a feedlot vet stand in front of a room there's about a hundred  of us in and say, we categorize everything into either high risk or low risk coming off  
**[1:10:31-1:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:31):**  the truck.  High risk animals get Draxin, which is the most powerful antibiotic that we can use for  bovines.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:39):**  I mean, it's like, it's a tactical nuke or they get a, I think, Batril or Bactril, which  is a pretty mild antibiotic.  Now is that antibiotic?  
**[1:10:48-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:48):**  That's a low risk animal.  So does that antibiotic affect the bacteria in their rumen?  You're the doctor, doctor.  
**[1:10:54-1:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:54):**  Well, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know cows.  I'm sure it does.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:10:57):**  I would think it would.  Would it affect the bacteria in my stomach?  100%, 100%, you know, you feed, you give something a powerful antibiotic and it has antibiotic  
**[1:11:05-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:05):**  properties in there.  If it's supposed to kill bacteria, it's going to kill some of the gut flora guaranteed.  So basically what I'm saying is, and I want to repeat this, is this feedlot vet said that  
**[1:11:16-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:16):**  every animal that got off the truck was either high risk or low risk, not no risk.  There was no such thing as a no risk animal.  It was either high risk or low risk and they got one or two different categories of antibiotics.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:29):**  Okay, I get that.  I understand the numbers.  I understand the labor.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:34):**  I understand the cost.  I understand death loss.  But this is a problem that we've 100% created ourselves.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:42):**  And then we have, you know, the commodity meat system says our meat's antibiotic free.  Well we got it.  It's only antibiotic free because we trust the science and the science says that there's  
**[1:11:52-1:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:52):**  a withdrawal period that if they haven't had that needle in their neck for 90 days, that  they're clean, right?  They're antibiotic free.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:11:57):**  Gotcha.  That's a period of time.  That doesn't mean from conception or birth.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:00):**  From conception they've never had.  I mean, if I'm going to put my name on an animal and I'm going to sell that meat to  my customers, which I will someday, and I say that this meat is antibiotic free, it's  
**[1:12:13-1:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:13):**  antibiotic free.  That doesn't mean that when it came off the truck at the feedlot, because I thought it  was high risk animal and it might get sick, that I stuck it full of Draxin and I said  
**[1:12:21-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:21):**  that that's not sub-therapeutic.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:25):**  If they're sick, they're going to get antibiotics if I can't get them well by a holistic means,  but I'm also not going to market that animal that I gave a dart of Draxin to two years  ago as an animal that's antibiotic free because it's not.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:38):**  Not technically.  Yeah.  Now tell me, do they still, are antibiotics still added to animal feed?  
**[1:12:46-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:46):**  One time I had heard a statistic that the majority of antibiotics in the United States  actually go into animal feed.  80% of the antibiotics consumed in this country go to animals, go to livestock.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:12:58):**  80% of the antibiotics in this country go to livestock, doc.  And you know, like you're in the medical industry.  I don't have to tell you how many like tons that is.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:08):**  Yeah.  And there's been a real big move in the medical industry to move away from antibiotics.  We really try not to use antibiotics.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:13):**  You guys have made people mad this year, by the way.  I have so many mom friends that are mad that they're taking their kids to the doctor and  they won't give them an antibiotic.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:24):**  Dang it.  And I'm always so happy.  We're an hour and 15 minutes into this.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:28):**  I bet we just made a whole bunch of more people mad.  Well, and I don't want to vilify drug development.  I mean, I think there's some amazing drugs and I use medications.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:38):**  I don't want to make it sound like I'm not fixing problems by rubbing crystals on people.  I mean, every once in a while I've got to pull amoxicillin out of the cabinet.  So I'm glad it's there.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:49):**  But it's a tool.  It's a tool.  Right.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:13:52):**  And you've got to know when's the appropriate time to use that tool.  And it sounds like in the feed industry, the antibiotics are used indiscriminately almost.  Almost.  
**[1:14:00-1:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:00):**  And they'll try to say like, I'm having a big problem, you know, like understanding  that almost every animal that gets off the truck in a feedlot classified as high risk  and gets antibiotics.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:12):**  But then they turn around into the other corner of their mouth.  They say we don't use sub.  It's not prophylactic and it's not sub therapeutic.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:20):**  So what is it?  Are we?  Yeah.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:23):**  What are all the animals coming off the truck that you've never seen before?  You're automatically assuming they're sick and giving them drachs and calling them sick  animals or using it prophylactically.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:32):**  And what are they looking at when they when the cow comes off?  I mean, they look in the cow's throat and its ears and saying, oh, it looks like an  infection or taking a rectal temperature or they just eyeballing it and saying that cow  
**[1:14:42-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:42):**  looks like it's got a runny nose.  Let's give it an antibiotic.  There's a super smart guy in the pen that sorts cows like that usually.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:49):**  No, I think what happens is they don't even they don't even look.  Here's what happens.  They know where they came from.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:14:56):**  So if you've got a buyer that's sitting in a sale barn and say Woodward, Oklahoma,  and he's got an order from a feedlot to put together five truckloads of cows or five truckloads  of steers.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:15:10):**  Okay.  And he's not going to know that he's going to fill his order and he's not going to  know each one of those five trucks might have 10 different ranches that gave that had five  
**[1:15:22-1:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:15:22):**  cows had five steers each.  So there could be, you know, 20 different ranches represented on these five trucks.  They don't know how those ranches took care of their calves.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:15:34):**  The guy, the order buyer.  All he cares to hear is two rounds of vaccine.  He's not going to write down which ones, right, because he's not going to care because the  
**[1:15:42-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:15:42):**  feedlot that told him to pick up those steers, they're not going to care because as soon  as those calves get there, they're just going to shove a needle in their neck and pump them  full antibiotic because they don't want to lose that because they want to ensure they  
**[1:15:56-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:15:56):**  want to just clean everything.  They want to nuke everything to bears to nothing, then let it onto their yard.  So they think they have a totally clean yard without any disease.  
**[1:16:07-1:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:16:07):**  Right.  What happens?  What happens when you have an environment like that?  
**[1:16:12-1:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:16:12):**  You set up an environment that you try to get all the pathogens out of and try to keep  it totally clean, but you're out in nature with living organisms.  Something gets in that's resistant to your vaccine program or your antibiotic program?  
**[1:16:29-1:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:16:29):**  What's that scenario like, Doc?  Yeah, so, well, I mean, it's a recipe for disaster because you're now selecting for  the pathogens that will get past that antibiotic.  
**[1:16:39-1:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:16:39):**  You've created a selection pressure.  It's the same thing we've been doing this last two years.  It's like vaccinating during the COVID pandemic.  
**[1:16:47-1:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:16:47):**  Yeah, I mean, you know, I followed Geert Vanden Bosch, who was a vaccine developer, and his  whole career was in vaccine development.  And he said early on, I watched a lecture he was giving, and he said, it's a really  
**[1:17:01-1:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:01):**  bad idea to mass vaccinate in the middle of a pandemic.  And he gave an example of a bird illness, Merrick's disease.  Does that sound familiar to you guys?  
**[1:17:12-1:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:12):**  Yeah, so I guess there's this thing that chickens get that's called Merrick's.  And if you vaccinate while Merrick's is spreading in your flock, you'll make it worse.  Because it'll cause mutations.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:24):**  The virus will try to work around the vaccine.  It'll see that...  Which is simply the chickens that have the strongest viruses in their body are the ones  
**[1:17:30-1:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:30):**  that are going to live and stay sick, right?  Yeah, right.  And they'll select for a more virulent pathogen.  
**[1:17:36-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:36):**  So I remember him saying this, and I remember thinking, oh, well, that's interesting.  I didn't hear anybody else say that.  I thought, well, you know, one thing is we're going to find out.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:45):**  We found out, didn't we?  And we found out, right?  And so we're at the point now where vaccine efficacy, I think the latest pediatric trial  
**[1:17:51-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:17:51):**  vaccine efficacy was under 40%, which means relative risk reduction of the vaccine was  less than 40%.  By the way, the emergency use authorization set a threshold in the adult trials of 50%.  
**[1:18:04-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:04):**  They didn't get at least 50% vaccine efficacy, which is relative risk reduction.  This is complicated statistics, but relative risk means relative to the treatment group  that didn't get the vaccine.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:18):**  Then they were like, you're not going to get emergency use authorization.  And you know, the news was, oh, it's 97% effective.  I remember hearing that and saying, nothing's 97% effective.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:28):**  That's a lie.  Nothing is 97%.  I go, that's remarkable.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:34):**  And you know, again, I was watching this kind of thing.  When you hear that, you know they're playing with the data.  Well, it at least makes your eyebrow go up and say, huh, 97%.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:43):**  So I dug into that study and looked and said, okay, what were they talking about?  And I was like, oh, they're talking about relative risk reduction of 97%.  I said, well, let's look through the back of the paper and see what the absolute risk  
**[1:18:56-1:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:18:56):**  reduction is, meaning if I vaccinate you, what's the absolute risk that I've dropped  you down?  The absolute risk reduction was less than a percent.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:05):**  Now, how would that have gone over in the mainstream media and the news and, oh, our  vaccine came in at 0.97% absolute risk reduction.  People would be like, I'm not going to do it for 0.97%.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:17):**  So in redneck dummy talk, that's a 1% less chance of getting sick?  Yeah, less than 1% chance.  Your absolute risk reduction is if I give you this intervention, I've dropped your risk  
**[1:19:27-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:27):**  from whatever it was down another percent, which if you're a very sick person, that percent  would be mean.  I mean, it could matter.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:34):**  You know, if we're talking 2% to 1%, that's a big difference.  If we're talking 95% to 94%, that's irrelevant.  Well, and so what we were sold is that this vaccine is 97% effective.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:45):**  People thought, well, that means that it's just going to work almost 100%.  And Fauci said, there's a couple of clips of him saying it's virtually 100% effective.  And, you know, when he said that, I thought, man, this is a tricky area to go into because  
**[1:19:59-1:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:19:59):**  over time, I think we're going to find that this vaccine is not working as well as we  thought.  And then what's going to happen?  
**[1:20:05-1:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:05):**  People aren't going to trust your message anymore, which is where we are today.  It's absolutely where.  And I can honestly say I'm thankful for that.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:11):**  I see more people questioning, asking the questions that you guys and your practice  are wanting people to ask than I ever, ever have in my life.  And for reasons totally outside of politics, which is a nice change to see.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:23):**  Now I guess I have to say, you know, just say the disclaimer, I'm not an anti-vaxxer,  right?  Everybody has to say that, you know?  
**[1:20:33-1:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:33):**  Meaning I think, you know, there's vaccines that are good, but I'm also not in that category  that says just because it's a vaccine, I'm going to do it.  It's like, you know, it's a tool.  
**[1:20:42-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:42):**  Well when they change, they're different.  And they changed the definition of vaccine.  They did.  
**[1:20:48-1:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:20:48):**  And like, they just kind of like, we changed the definition of vaccine and just went right  on past it.  They said that vaccine basically changed to something that generates an immune response.  
**[1:21:00-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:00):**  That's how they did it.  Talk about setting the lowest bar possible.  That makes a lot of cool stuff happen for like homeopathic medicine then because all,  
**[1:21:07-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:07):**  that's what all of that is.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe all of that could be considered a vaccine now.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:12):**  Yeah.  So you're right.  I mean, you have completely changed and broadened that definition because otherwise you would  
**[1:21:19-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:19):**  have to call it what it is.  Experimental gene therapy.  Gene therapy.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:23):**  Go ahead Spotify, flag me with another COVID warning.  See if I care.  But it's true.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:30):**  I mean, these experiments are still ongoing.  They don't finish up until March of next year.  People forget that.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:36):**  The original trials are still ongoing.  And I remember I was watching somebody on CNN.  Well the pandemic's over.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:43):**  Yeah, it's over now.  Right.  But I was watching some in CNN and they were asking an FDA regulator and they were like,  
**[1:21:49-1:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:49):**  they were kind of banging the table saying like, why did it take so long for us to get  this vaccine?  And the expression on the guy's face was this guy's kind of got a little bit wide.  
**[1:21:58-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:21:58):**  And I, and as soon as I saw that, I looked and I go, I know exactly what's going through  that guy's mind.  He's thinking this guy has no idea how long it normally takes to approve a drug.  
**[1:22:09-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:09):**  The fastest drug we've ever developed was, you know, three years, most vaccines, eight  to 18 years of development.  So to get something in 18 months is not warp speed.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:19):**  It's like time travel.  Okay.  Right.  
**[1:22:22-1:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:22):**  And like we were saying, like, well, okay, it's safe and effective, safe and effective.  But safe means we know it doesn't cause harm in the long run.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:30):**  Cannot say that because it hasn't been here.  It just baffled me how many very educated, very intelligent, I mean, like just book smart  people.  
**[1:22:41-1:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:41):**  And the scientists would say it's safe, it's been proven safe and effective.  Yeah.  Number one, if that's the case, why were they studying this long enough ago to know that?  
**[1:22:52-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:52):**  Number two, it's not the case.  Yeah.  It's clearly not the case.  
**[1:22:55-1:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:22:55):**  So now we have a black box warning that says, it can cause myocarditis and we're arguing  about whether we should vaccinate kids.  And so, I mean, I don't want to take you down the path of getting canceled here, but it's  
**[1:23:08-1:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:08):**  been a crazy year.  I think Joe Rogan, a lot of his podcasts with some of the guests that he's done.  He cracked the seal.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:15):**  Yeah.  I think he did a better job of talking about a lot of those things than we're going to  get accomplished here.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:22):**  Sure.  I mean.  No, I agree.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:25):**  I mean, I think, you know, you look at, you know, Robert Malone has been a very polarizing  figure, but I mean, you can't say that he did it for the money.  I mean, Robert Malone is, I mean, he lost his bid for a Nobel Prize.  
**[1:23:38-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:38):**  He's lost a lot.  He lost a lot, you know, and I met with Peter McCullough, a cardiologist out of Dallas.  He was in Wichita and I sat down with him for about an hour and a half.  
**[1:23:49-1:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:49):**  And I will tell you, that guy has been persecuted.  I mean, he's actually the point where he's like, maybe I need to figure out how to make  a living if I lose my medical license.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:23:58):**  Right.  So to say that this is a grifter who's making money off of anti-vax rhetoric is absolutely  false.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:05):**  He's a person who is deeply conscientious and is deeply convicted and really truly cares  about human health.  He's taking a huge risk to speak up like this.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:17):**  He lost his, he lost two professorships.  He lost his editorial position at the journal that he was an editor of and he lost his job  at Baylor Medical System.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:31):**  So I mean, he's lost a lot, but yet he's still saying the same thing.  It's like, hey, early treatment works.  So I think that's where we got on this whole subject was saying, you know, that was something  
**[1:24:39-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:39):**  during the pandemic because I was very aggressive in saying, I want to use every tool we can  to help people with COVID.  So whether it's vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc.  
**[1:24:49-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:49):**  You know, in general, you talked about the medication you can't say the name of anymore.  The horse dewormer?  I can say ivermectin.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:24:56):**  You can say ivermectin.  Um, you were talking about when we were up in Wichita about wanting to have food in your  clinic.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:03):**  And I was like, that was, I mean, what doctor wants food?  Well, like, that's amazing.  It's like the second time I've just about been able to make a segue into food is medicine.  
**[1:25:15-1:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:15):**  Yes.  And start talking about what's wrong with our food.  Yeah.  
**[1:25:20-1:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:20):**  So I think the thing that I've seen with food, and this was really evident during the pandemic  when I went to the store and they didn't have chicken.  I was like, I've never been to the store where you can't buy something.  
**[1:25:30-1:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:30):**  It's just always there.  We take it for granted.  And I thought, oh, man, maybe we're not as food safe as we think we are.  
**[1:25:38-1:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:38):**  Like, maybe I need to start thinking about growing my own food.  Or maybe I need to go get a couple cows and put them out on my pasture.  Right.  
**[1:25:45-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:45):**  I certainly know I need to grow a garden.  And so I started thinking about, okay, what are the barriers to entry for me doing that?  How do I help my patients do that?  
**[1:25:56-1:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:25:56):**  So you know, again, what primarily I do as a doctor is I'm just a problem solver, trying  to find solutions to problems that people have.  So one of the problems people have is we need to redefine what healthy food is.  
**[1:26:09-1:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:09):**  So I always say healthy food is not out of a, I think I borrowed this from my dad, but  it said it's not out of a bag, a box, a can, over the counter or through a window.  Okay.  
**[1:26:18-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:18):**  And if it has more than five ingredients, you should question whether it's food.  I think that's one of Michael Pollan's food rules.  He wrote a great book called Omnivore's Dilemma, and he's written some really fantastic books.  
**[1:26:28-1:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:28):**  I'm taking notes.  Good stuff.  And then the other thing I tell people is if there's an ingredient on the label that  
**[1:26:33-1:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:33):**  you don't have that in your pantry, right?  You read something and you're like, I don't even know what this is, then don't eat that.  That's probably not food.  
**[1:26:41-1:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:41):**  You mean nobody has, you mean you don't have lake number 40 yellow in your...  Not that I know of.  Or, you know, blue number seven?  
**[1:26:50-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:50):**  You don't have that?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  
**[1:26:53-1:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:26:53):**  You don't keep a jar of monosodium glutamate?  Yeah.  That's spice I think you can actually buy.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:00):**  Yeah, you can buy it.  Yeah.  But you're right.  
**[1:27:04-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:04):**  I mean, so it's trying to educate people.  Because again, we have to educate.  That's what doctor means.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:11):**  Doctor comes from the Latin word docere, which means to teach.  Okay.  So...  
**[1:27:16-1:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:16):**  I actually never knew that.  Yeah.  So our job is not to prescribe.  
**[1:27:19-1:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:19):**  Our job is to teach.  And used to be before there was widespread medical usage or medicine to use, that doctors  prescribe diets.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:26):**  Like I mentioned, the ketogenic diet, it's in the medical literature 100 years ago.  Well, if we follow the analogy that food is medicine, that's what a doctor should do is  teach you how to eat to better take care of the machine that you're living in and how  
**[1:27:41-1:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:41):**  to take care of it.  Yeah.  And I get frustrated when I hear doctors say, well, it doesn't matter what you eat.  
**[1:27:46-1:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:46):**  And I say, okay, let's think about this.  Every meal you eat goes through your stomach and into your small bowel.  And in your small bowel, you have these villi, these little finger-like projections that  
**[1:27:57-1:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:27:57):**  increase the surface area of the gut for absorption.  The surface area of that small bowel in an adult is two tennis courts.  And the thickness of that cell layer that's the barrier between the inside world and the  
**[1:28:11-1:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:28:11):**  outside world is half the width of a human hair.  So every time we eat, our food is spread out over the surface area of two tennis courts  that's half a width of a human hair away from 70% of our immune system.  
**[1:28:23-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:28:23):**  How can it not matter what we eat?  It has to matter.  It absolutely has to matter.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:28:29):**  Yeah.  So when you look at most of the problems facing Americans and obesity being the top of the  list because obesity leads to heart disease, obesity leads to a lot of other problems,  
**[1:28:40-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:28:40):**  we have to begin thinking, how are we going to fix this metabolic mess that we're in?  And so we've got to do it with food.  So like I was telling you at lunch today, the biggest lie in medicine today is the lie  
**[1:28:53-1:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:28:53):**  that type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that needs medical management, chronic medical  management.  Go on.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:01):**  Which means more pills, more syringes.  How much does insulin cost these days?  It depends what kind of insulin you're talking about.  
**[1:29:09-1:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:09):**  You could go buy a bottle of insulin at Walmart right now without a prescription for about  10 bucks.  And that's a very old form of insulin.  
**[1:29:19-1:29:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:19):**  And that probably lasts me, what, a month?  Well, it depends how much sugar you drink.  I guess it doesn't matter since I'm not diabetic.  
**[1:29:25-1:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:25):**  Go on.  I can buy over-the-counter insulin without a prescription for, let's just say, 10 bucks.  Yeah.  
**[1:29:31-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:31):**  But the real question is, and to be clear, I'm talking about type 2 diabetes, right?  The diabetes.  The lie that we have to manage that with medication and then it's a chronic disease, that's a  
**[1:29:41-1:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:41):**  lie because it's completely reversible with diet.  So if I take someone who's a type 2 diabetic with a…  You just upset a whole bunch of people.  
**[1:29:50-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:50):**  I do.  And I feel, sometimes I feel bad because I say these things and I know they're thinking,  hey, this is nuts.  
**[1:29:56-1:30:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:29:56):**  I'm like…  Don't feel bad.  We're challenging somebody's paradigm because if someone is offended by what you  
**[1:30:03-1:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:03):**  or I or anybody else has to say, we're just challenging their belief structure.  And there's people who just can't tolerate having their belief structure challenged at  all.  
**[1:30:13-1:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:13):**  And the problem is, look, you know, come to my practice and I'll show you.  I mean, I've got hundreds of patients that I've been able to take who have A1Cs.  An A1C is a hemoglobin A1C is basically a measurement of how much glucose is stuck to  
**[1:30:26-1:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:26):**  your hemoglobin molecule.  How much sugar is in your blood?  In the hemoglobin of your blood, which is your red blood cell.  
**[1:30:33-1:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:33):**  Now why do we measure that?  Well, your red blood cell on average lives about 90 days.  Okay.  
**[1:30:38-1:30:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:38):**  Bone marrow kicks a new one out.  It lives for 90 days, gets ragged.  Your spleen chews it up.  
**[1:30:42-1:30:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:42):**  And so when we look at the percentage of glycosylation of that protein, we're getting a kind of a  snapshot of what did the last 90 days in your diet look like.  Glycosylation of the protein.  
**[1:30:52-1:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:52):**  What's that?  Stickiness.  Stickiness of the protein.  
**[1:30:55-1:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:30:55):**  Things just like how much sugar is stuck to that protein.  Okay.  So a diabetic is we define it as having an A1C over 6.7% or 6.8%.  
**[1:31:05-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:05):**  It's this arbitrary line we draw in the sand.  So meaning the day before your A1C was 6.4, you weren't diabetic.  The day after I measure it, it's now 6.8.  
**[1:31:14-1:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:14):**  You are diabetic.  Well, what really changed?  Nothing.  
**[1:31:17-1:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:17):**  It just, you got a little bit more glycosylation.  I had a Snickers bar.  So you know, drugs that knock it out of the park claim that they can lower an A1C by a  
**[1:31:26-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:26):**  fraction of a percent and that's like a success.  Well, I can take someone who has an A1C of 10 or 11, which is double what that should  be.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:35):**  Okay.  So if they die it for three months, if they follow the plan, I can normalize that A1C.  That A1C can look non-diabetic.  
**[1:31:46-1:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:46):**  And take them off insulin.  Take them off insulin.  In fact, the reality is most type two diabetics are making way too much insulin.  
**[1:31:53-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:53):**  So I measure their insulin.  It should be around six to nine and I'll measure their insulin.  It's 26.  
**[1:31:59-1:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:31:59):**  Fasting.  This is before they've even eaten a meal.  No, God knows what it does after they eat a meal.  
**[1:32:03-1:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:03):**  So that person's resistant to the insulin that they're making.  So their body has to make more and more.  It has to keep turning the dial up to get the same effect.  
**[1:32:11-1:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:11):**  So the type two diabetic doesn't need insulin.  And that was where I realized, why am I giving these people insulin?  They're making boatloads of it.  
**[1:32:21-1:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:21):**  That's not the problem.  They're not insulin deficient.  A type one diabetic is insulin deficient.  
**[1:32:25-1:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:25):**  They'll die without it.  So that's where we just started saying, well, we got to attack this with diet and we got  to attack it with lifestyle changes.  
**[1:32:33-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:33):**  And then what's fun is that you can do those labs and you measure and you show patients,  hey, look what your A1C is now.  It came down.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:40):**  Look at your fasting insulin.  You brought it from 26 down to 12.  And then when you check it again, it's down to six.  
**[1:32:44-1:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:44):**  And now it's down to four.  It's down to three.  And they're starting to lose weight.  
**[1:32:48-1:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:48):**  They're starting to feel better.  They're starting to say, you know what?  I want to start adding exercise in.  
**[1:32:51-1:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:32:51):**  Well, that'll make everything go even faster.  So you create this snowball effect in the right direction when you start with food.  And that's the opposite place from where probably 90% of your colleagues will start is they  
**[1:33:03-1:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:03):**  want to start with a pill or with a needle or with some more tests and not worry about  the food because what you eat doesn't matter, carbs or carbs.  Right.  
**[1:33:11-1:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:11):**  Yeah.  Or they'll say, you know, just eat a balanced diet.  Nobody knows what a balanced diet is anymore.  
**[1:33:15-1:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:15):**  Yeah.  What is a balanced diet?  Write that down for me.  
**[1:33:18-1:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:18):**  Is it the food pyramid?  Because that's clearly did not do well for us over the last 40 years.  I think just changing to where you're eating with intention, even if, you know, it doesn't  
**[1:33:28-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:28):**  matter what you eat.  Well, maybe it doesn't necessarily matter exactly what you eat.  But the intention behind the food you're choosing and when you're eating and why you're eating  
**[1:33:36-1:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:36):**  and how you're eating.  Or, you know, one of the things that there was a study that looked at people who just  sat down at a table and ate and looked at the difference of somebody grabbing a fast  
**[1:33:48-1:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:48):**  food and eating in their car.  And metabolically, you metabolize differently when you sit down and enjoy a meal.  Enjoy a meal rather than snarf food for only fuel.  
**[1:33:58-1:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:33:58):**  Right.  I bet you...  Shoveling food in.  
**[1:34:01-1:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:01):**  I bet you if you take that experiment and repeat it between a guy that's eating a cheeseburger  in his car in between meetings and a family that sits down and joins hands and prays and  then shares a meal, I bet you'd find...  
**[1:34:17-1:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:17):**  I bet you'd have some really interesting results.  Yeah.  It's a difference.  
**[1:34:21-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:21):**  And in Europe, you know, Europeans, I think when they sit down and eat at a restaurant,  I mean, it could be two or three hours that they're sitting down.  It's an event.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:27):**  It's an event.  It's a whole evening.  I went to Greece when I was in college.  
**[1:34:32-1:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:32):**  Studied there abroad for a month and we sat down at a table for dinner with a bunch of  friends and it took like 20 minutes for the waitress to even come out and I was like,  what is taking so long?  
**[1:34:45-1:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:45):**  And you know, it was another 20 minutes before their drinks came out.  It took four and a half hours for us to finish that meal.  And it's still in my mind one of the best meals I've ever had.  
**[1:34:55-1:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:34:55):**  It probably had very little to do with food.  Yeah.  I don't even remember really what was on the menu, but what I remember was we were outside  
**[1:35:02-1:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:02):**  under a tree in Greece at the foot of the Parthenon or wherever we were and we're laughing  or talking and we're eating and it's a whole celebration of life at that point, right?  I mean, I don't want to get sappy with it, but it was a really...  
**[1:35:17-1:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:17):**  It was a meal.  It was a feast.  Right.  
**[1:35:20-1:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:20):**  Right.  And that's different from, you know, that's maybe that's a difference from, you know,  like concentrated feeding operation, right?  
**[1:35:25-1:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:25):**  They're just going in there and just chowing down.  There's a happy medium there too because I grew up in a restaurant family.  We like eat for everything.  
**[1:35:34-1:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:34):**  So I've always been the short fat girl.  I like food and it's not hard for me to like make every occasion about food and around  food.  
**[1:35:42-1:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:42):**  So every family function we had, we did have a feast.  And so, and I met Brian and they kind of don't eat like that.  They eat more for fuel and don't have like these big huge shindigs.  
**[1:35:51-1:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:35:51):**  So we've sort of found a happy medium where we eat for fuel with purpose more often and  like grow and my raising my daughter, we didn't sit at the table a lot.  We would gather in the kitchen and kind of graze on whatever we had that was healthy  
**[1:36:05-1:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:05):**  and spend the time together to do that.  But it kind of was a, it was a difficulty for me going the opposite way where everything  was about food and it wasn't necessarily about enjoying the food.  
**[1:36:17-1:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:17):**  It was like we couldn't gather without having the food.  Yeah.  And for some people, food is an emotional thing.  
**[1:36:24-1:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:24):**  I mean, they eat when they're stressed and yeah, and you know that getting into the whole  stress signals and what that does to our body is a whole nother conversation that we can  have.  
**[1:36:34-1:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:34):**  Well, I mean, it is kind of nice to curl up on the couch with a carton of ice cream and  just, you know, eat it while you cry all your problems away.  Not saying I ever do that or ever have.  
**[1:36:44-1:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:44):**  It's also awesome thing to spend a really intentional two or three or four hours with  your family and cook and share a meal.  Yeah.  
**[1:36:51-1:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:36:51):**  If that's the thing I could get families back to, you know, if I can get people raising  food in their backyard and making food, what I like to say is I want to help make food  a more local phenomenon, right?  
**[1:37:01-1:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:01):**  And so that's why I started reaching out to guys like you, regenerative farmers, because  I've got patients who need access to good high quality, you know, grass fed, truly grass  fed grass finished beef.  
**[1:37:13-1:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:13):**  And you know, and I learned very quickly grass fed, everything's technically grass fed in  United States because they all have eaten grass at some point.  Yeah.  
**[1:37:21-1:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:21):**  And you can't trust labels anymore.  You can't trust labels, that's for sure.  So and you want to get to know your farmer.  
**[1:37:26-1:37:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:26):**  And we all need to we all need to start making friends with farmers.  And we need to because you guys, you guys are suffering, right?  I mean, I've seen it.  
**[1:37:34-1:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:34):**  Depression, the burnout.  Oh, and as all the inflation that's come up in the last couple months really starts to  settle in and the higher input costs start to settle in on a lot of guys, it's going  
**[1:37:44-1:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:44):**  to get dark.  It's going to get really dark for a lot of guys.  And I think if we can connect if we can start connecting, so if I connect my people with  
**[1:37:51-1:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:37:51):**  your people and say, hey, go find a farmer, get on their list for a cow, you know, get  a custom cut, buy a big freezer plan ahead.  And get to know your farmer, ask them questions like we did today.  
**[1:38:04-1:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:04):**  We're not and I saw your operation.  I mean, you're practically kissing your cows when they're coming up to literally not literally,  I have pictures of it.  
**[1:38:13-1:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:13):**  And I could tell, I mean, as soon as we came over that ridge, your cows love you.  He loves them too.  Yeah, you're calling them out by name.  
**[1:38:22-1:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:22):**  You're whistling to them.  Hey, Ginger, come over here.  Hey, carrot topper.  
**[1:38:25-1:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:25):**  And it wasn't carrot topper.  Peaches, curly, Moe, Steve.  That's my name for that one.  
**[1:38:32-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:32):**  Okay, that's fine.  But you know, that's I think, again, we kind of think about making food a bigger part of  our lives.  
**[1:38:41-1:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:41):**  Well, like Tanya said, meet your meat.  That's something that, you know, we hear in the community.  I'm a big fan of saying shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[1:38:48-1:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:48):**  And I feel like,  And I say, it's find out what your food's eating.  Yep, that too.  
**[1:38:55-1:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:38:55):**  And the whole shake the hand that feeds you, I think, nicely wraps up and puts a bow on  a lot of concepts because, you know, like we talked about, you know, antibiotic use  in a feedlot.  
**[1:39:06-1:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:06):**  Right.  I'm not gonna put my name on that.  If you want to, you can come meet me, you can come shake my hand.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:11):**  And I will spend all of the time that you want.  And we'll talk about cows, we'll talk about grass, we'll talk about how I took care of  them and how I cared for them.  
**[1:39:22-1:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:22):**  And how I provided for them their whole life.  And I want to share that story with the people that want to consume my product.  Yeah.  
**[1:39:32-1:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:32):**  And I think also going back to soil, you're making better soil.  At the end of the, we are soil.  We have to be.  
**[1:39:39-1:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:39):**  I mean, the soil is our start and our end.  We come from soil and we will all be soil.  Dust to dust.  
**[1:39:48-1:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:48):**  I mean, when I die, don't put me in a crematorium.  Like just wrap me up in a paper sack and throw me in a hole and let me be worm food and continue  part of the cycle.  
**[1:39:57-1:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:39:57):**  Don't fill me full of the balmy fluid.  You can actually buy a pine box casket from Costco.  Nice.  
**[1:40:04-1:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:04):**  Special order them.  I know what the cost of everything else in the medical industry.  I can't imagine the end of life industry.  
**[1:40:10-1:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:10):**  Their costs are going down either.  No.  Yeah.  
**[1:40:13-1:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:13):**  The end of life industry is an interesting one.  It is fascinating what we do to our bodies after death.  It is weird.  
**[1:40:19-1:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:19):**  Yeah.  Like we're going to buy this $10,000 box that's really, really ornate.  That's nice and padded inside.  
**[1:40:27-1:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:27):**  We're going to get, we're going to put on this nice tuxedo and lay down in this box  that's going to get thrown in a hole in the ground that nobody's ever going to see again.  Not even a hole in the ground.  
**[1:40:38-1:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:38):**  It's thrown into a concrete box in the ground.  Right.  I mean, I guess we could look at the mummies and think the same thing.  
**[1:40:44-1:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:44):**  You know, they, I mean, at least we get dressed up fancy.  They took all kinds of stuff.  True.  
**[1:40:49-1:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:49):**  But wasn't it just the kings they mummified?  It wasn't the common man, was it?  No, it definitely wasn't the commoners.  
**[1:40:54-1:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:40:54):**  The celebration of like the death of the human form, like of the bag of bones, we are as  weird to me.  Yeah.  
**[1:41:00-1:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:00):**  I mean, we've seen some pushes to bring back the old fashioned wake, you know, where the  body laid in state, meaning, you know, you die in your bed, you stay in your bed, family  comes up, cleans you up.  
**[1:41:11-1:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:11):**  And, you know, it's not like you're immediately a health hazard minutes after you die.  Right.  You've got a couple days before decomposition starts setting in.  
**[1:41:19-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:19):**  Colder climates, maybe a few more.  But giving time for people to see that, you know, I guess I think that everybody's different  about this.  
**[1:41:31-1:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:31):**  I'm not trying to be critical, but I think when you see a dead body who's been embalmed  and makeup is put on and you're trying to mimic what they were in life.  But I think what we need to do as humans is say, that person's gone.  
**[1:41:46-1:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:46):**  They're not that anyone.  Yeah, that soul has left.  And that physical being is on its way to being something else.  
**[1:41:54-1:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:41:54):**  And that's why they look different because they're supposed to look different.  Yeah, and don't you think maybe that maybe helps us get through the grieving process  faster?  
**[1:42:01-1:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:01):**  Because you don't see that you're burying your person.  Right.  You see, you look at that and say, oh, yeah, they're gone.  
**[1:42:07-1:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:07):**  I can start releasing that.  I can start letting go of that.  But yeah, I agree.  
**[1:42:11-1:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:11):**  I think I'm, you know, I'd rather just be planted in the field and be, you know, food  for worms that feed the grass and then hopefully get, you know, better mycorrhizal growth out  of me.  
**[1:42:23-1:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:23):**  That's what we need.  Turn me to mushrooms.  I have to do this.  
**[1:42:26-1:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:26):**  So we're sitting here in the Eastis Media Studio in Pratt, Kansas, and I just saw somebody  walk by wearing a Great Plains Regeneration shirt.  Really?  
**[1:42:35-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:35):**  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:42:38-1:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:38):**  That's why I had the death.  The message is getting out.  The message is getting out.  
**[1:42:41-1:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:41):**  So just add you're being heard.  No, I really do love what the regenerative movement is doing.  And I, you know, I kind of came to it through listening to Joel Salitan talk.  
**[1:42:53-1:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:42:53):**  And, you know, like I told you, I started reading some books that not many doctors are  probably reading like Gabe Brown's book, Dirt to Soil.  Pretty common recommendation on this podcast.  
**[1:43:05-1:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:05):**  Hobbes turned me on to Johan Zeitzman wrote Man, Cattle, Veld.  That's an interesting book.  Johan Zeitzman, Man, Cattle and Veld.  
**[1:43:15-1:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:15):**  Yeah.  Veld.  Yeah.  
**[1:43:18-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:18):**  And then Alan Savory is another interesting guy that's in it.  He's done some TED Talks that I happen to listen to.  So interesting is one way to describe Alan Savory.  
**[1:43:26-1:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:26):**  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, and I think what I've learned is that it's similar to my business that there's not  
**[1:43:31-1:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:31):**  one way of doing things, right?  I mean, the way Joel does things is going to be different from the way that, you know,  Jaco Farm and Yoder does it.  
**[1:43:39-1:43:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:39):**  And it's going to be different from how Red Hills Rancher does it.  And it all comes down to context.  We've talked about that a lot because what works in my backyard that's seven miles away  
**[1:43:48-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:48):**  from his ranch.  I don't garden the same way he ranches.  Yeah.  
**[1:43:53-1:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:43:53):**  And that was remarkable driving up because I have not been to this part of Kansas before,  not back in these.  I've driven through Pratt many times.  
**[1:44:00-1:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:00):**  You've never seen the Red Hills.  Never seen the Red Hills before.  And I was like, man, this is gorgeous out here.  
**[1:44:04-1:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:04):**  But it is a different terrain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:44:08-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:08):**  And moving, I mean, there's a couple times we're going down into those culverts and I'm  thinking, I don't know if this is going to flip over or not.  Well, I'm glad to hear that because he gives me a hard time every time I go.  
**[1:44:18-1:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:18):**  I just hung onto the handle, but I was like, oh, he knows what he's doing.  You're not.  I didn't see you.  
**[1:44:23-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:23):**  He didn't say, why are you hanging on?  I didn't see you sweating.  So I figured we're going to be OK.  
**[1:44:27-1:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:27):**  Don't get nervous until I get nervous.  We're fine.  But it's very rough.  
**[1:44:33-1:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:33):**  Yeah, it's rough, but it's rugged.  But there's beauty out there.  You know, and I think the people who think Kansas is flat, I'm like, yeah, well, most  
**[1:44:41-1:44:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:41):**  of Colorado is flat too.  But they don't they're not seeing the part of Kansas that most people aren't seeing.  Like there's a whole eastern two thirds of Colorado that's flatter than a pancake.  
**[1:44:50-1:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:50):**  It's just like Kansas.  Well, and then of course, we're going to put highways in the areas where it's flat test,  right?  
**[1:44:56-1:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:44:56):**  Because it's going to be easiest to make those roads.  So it was fun.  I enjoyed the drive this morning.  
**[1:45:02-1:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:02):**  But you're right.  I was driving past all these monoculture row cropped fields and I'm thinking, there's not  even a weed growing out there.  
**[1:45:12-1:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:12):**  Is that been pretty recent that you've just been able to kind of see that and it?  Yeah.  It's a huge change.  
**[1:45:17-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:17):**  Like in six months from now, you're going to be driving around in an area of the country  where you six months ago would have thought, man, it's so beautiful.  It's spring.  
**[1:45:24-1:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:24):**  Look at all the corn and the wheat.  And you're going to be out there going, oh, my gosh, there's not a bug to be seen.  Right.  
**[1:45:29-1:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:29):**  This used to be beautiful.  And now it makes me sick to my stomach.  And it's terrifying.  
**[1:45:32-1:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:32):**  Yeah.  When we moved out to the country almost 10 years ago, it was about nine years ago.  The it was remarkable because we sit on about 28 acres that's most of it is native prairie.  
**[1:45:48-1:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:48):**  And we had a guy from the Kansas Grassland Society, Wildflower Society come down and  do a survey.  It was really fun walking through the fields with him.  
**[1:45:58-1:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:45:58):**  And he was picking up stuff and he'd say, here, chew on this little flower.  Like, oh, it tastes like pepper.  It's like, yeah, well, he named the plant and he picked this up like, what kind of grass  
**[1:46:06-1:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:06):**  is that?  He goes, that's not a grass.  And I go, oh, what's the difference?  
**[1:46:10-1:46:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:10):**  You know, I don't know.  And he said something that was really remarkable.  He goes, you know, a hundred years ago, kids would have been able in high school would  
**[1:46:17-1:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:17):**  have been able to identify all of these plants and tell you which ones were invasive, which  ones were medicinal, which ones are edible and which ones you couldn't eat.  That was one of my favorite things in homeschool.  
**[1:46:29-1:46:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:29):**  Krista was in sixth grade.  Yeah.  So we studied botany and that's what we'd go outside and look at that.  
**[1:46:34-1:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:34):**  And we've so we've lost that literacy.  I don't want to jump in the truck and like go streaming down this interstate highway  of how the educational standards have completely gone away in the last hundred years.  
**[1:46:47-1:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:47):**  But you're right.  Like the average college graduate today probably would have trouble with the eighth grade finals  exam from nineteen thirty five.  
**[1:46:58-1:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:46:58):**  Well and I'm even just food literacy like there there was in the inner cities of New  York they they brought in zucchini and rutabaga and squash and held them up.  Does anybody know what this is?  
**[1:47:11-1:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:11):**  They didn't know what it was.  They'd never seen vegetables.  Food deserts like they're this.  
**[1:47:17-1:47:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:17):**  Yeah.  It's all processed food like that study I was sharing with you that came out of Tufts  University that said we're now at a point where two thirds of adolescents calories are  
**[1:47:27-1:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:27):**  from ultra refined carbohydrates.  Duller general food and they're on every corner.  And remember the ultra fine carbohydrate is the one macronutrient you don't actually need.  
**[1:47:36-1:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:36):**  And what is that doing to to things like obesity rates people getting diabetes heart disease  having liver disease.  What is what are these ultra refined?  
**[1:47:48-1:47:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:48):**  Through the roof.  So now the number one reason for liver transplant is not Tylenol or out overdose or alcohol.  It's fatty liver disease from eating excessive carbohydrates.  
**[1:47:58-1:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:47:58):**  You know and so talk about just the problem of obesity.  My kids and I I've I grew up on Star Wars loved the movies as a kid.  I mean some of my earliest memories are going into the Star Wars movies and my kids fell  
**[1:48:09-1:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:09):**  in love with Star Wars.  So we were big Star Wars fans in our family and we were the kids and I were watching the  book of Boba Fett.  
**[1:48:16-1:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:16):**  I don't know it's a show you've seen but Boba Fett is like one of my favorite characters.  I'm a huge Star Wars nerd but some of the new expanded universe stuff like the Mandalorian  the new Boba Fett stuff.  
**[1:48:27-1:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:27):**  I'm kind of out on that.  I think Disney ruined most of the franchise with the last three movies.  Yeah I would agree but I would say the Mandalorian that's a.  
**[1:48:36-1:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:36):**  What was Rogue One?  Rogue One was.  Rogue One was definitely worth watching.  
**[1:48:39-1:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:39):**  I loved it.  I know it didn't get it didn't get a lot of fan service but I love the fact that when  it ended it was like well you knew those people weren't coming back.  
**[1:48:48-1:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:48):**  You know a spoiler alert.  It was a great yeah welcome to welcome to Star Wars podcast.  I thought it was a great way to tie in and wrap up everything that happened you know  
**[1:48:58-1:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:48:58):**  in movie three.  Right to bridge that.  With episode four that came out back in 77.  
**[1:49:03-1:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:49:03):**  I think it was a wonderful bridge and it brought a lot of things out in the story that we didn't  hear and maybe I guess like where I can go with that to tie that back to today's conversation  is similarly you know we're discovering things that we thought we knew about nutrition and  
**[1:49:19-1:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:49:19):**  they're coming back to light and they're changing the entire story as we thought we knew it.  Yeah well.  So where I was going with that is at the end of one of the Boba Fett episodes there's bonus  
**[1:49:30-1:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:49:30):**  material that you can watch and it was an interview with George Lucas about the character  Boba Fett and how they came up with him and how they were designing his costume and in  it George Lucas says oh and we took Boba Fett actually to a parade in California small town  
**[1:49:45-1:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:49:45):**  in California and he walked down the street Main Street with Main Street much like this  that's right out here and with Darth Vader right by his side.  And this was before the character was even introduced in the movies right.  
**[1:49:58-1:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:49:58):**  But what was remarkable about watching that scene that parade was the people.  So there's tons of kids running around mostly with their shirts off because it's summertime  there was not one overweight kid in the crowd.  
**[1:50:11-1:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:50:11):**  And I couldn't find an obese adult watching the parade either.  Now California classically has been on the healthier end.  And this would have been like the 1977 and 1979 timeframe because that's when the movies  
**[1:50:23-1:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:50:23):**  came out.  That's exactly right.  So before you know before we really had you know it took us it takes about 10 years once  
**[1:50:31-1:50:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:50:31):**  you make a policy change for it to really show up.  When did the food pyramid come out was that early 80s?  I think that's a good question that was before my time so I don't know.  
**[1:50:40-1:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:50:40):**  The 70s like late 70s early 80s.  A lot of this stuff came out of the McGovern Council on food which is really where we started  saying like how we're going to tell Americans how to eat.  
**[1:50:49-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:50:49):**  And that happened like through the 70s and that gave us the food pyramid.  So by mid 80s we're full swing you know Entenmann's Bakery remember that?  So I've got to tell a little story here.  
**[1:51:02-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:02):**  So I'm a child of the 80s.  The food pyramid was 92.  Oh really?  
**[1:51:07-1:51:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:07):**  Yeah and I remember when they introduced that in all of those nutrition facts.  Well thanks for looking that up Jamie.  Jamie look that up.  
**[1:51:16-1:51:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:16):**  Everybody needs a Jamie on their podcast.  I wish I had one.  Gosh I wish I had one.  
**[1:51:21-1:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:21):**  Yeah you just Google it.  Jamie does more than just Googling stuff.  Like he does all that he does the producing and editing so Joe can just stand up and walk  
**[1:51:28-1:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:28):**  out.  All I do is Google stuff.  I don't do anything behind the scenes at all.  
**[1:51:32-1:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:32):**  We can have the light version of Jamie.  I don't do anything at home.  Gosh what were you talking about?  
**[1:51:38-1:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:38):**  You were saying that you were about to tell a story.  What story was I going to tell?  Oh I remember now.  
**[1:51:43-1:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:43):**  So I'm a child of the 80s.  The food pyramid in 92.  I remember I was probably gosh four or five years old.  
**[1:51:52-1:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:51:52):**  So this would have been like 1982, 1983.  If you're good at math you can tell exactly how old I am.  And I think I've told this story before on the podcast.  
**[1:52:01-1:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:01):**  If I haven't I'm boring you.  Go ahead skip forward about two minutes.  So I grew up eating things like turkey and cheese sandwiches on whole wheat bread.  
**[1:52:11-1:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:11):**  Because this was like through the 70s and early 80s my parents were kind of like they  were trying to be hippies and come back and do the homestead type thing.  You're trying to do what everybody's doing today.  
**[1:52:22-1:52:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:22):**  Yeah and that didn't work for various reasons.  That's not anything we need to talk about on this podcast.  I remember a conversation with my mom talking about the difference between whole wheat bread  
**[1:52:34-1:52:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:34):**  and white bread and why we couldn't have white bread.  And basically she said because all the good stuff, all the vitamins are in the wheat germ.  And when they, white flour doesn't have that.  
**[1:52:47-1:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:47):**  They take that out and they throw it away.  And they have to enrich it.  That's why we have enriched white flour.  
**[1:52:54-1:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:52:54):**  We're putting all these vitamins and nutrients back into the flour after we already took  them out from the germ.  So okay I get that.  
**[1:53:04-1:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:53:04):**  Now I kind of understood that when you're refining stuff like that you're taking out  all the vitamins and minerals.  But as I'm growing up I'm thinking okay well the science says vitamins are vitamins  
**[1:53:18-1:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:53:18):**  so what difference does it make if it's a natural vitamin A source or if it's enriched  with vitamin A. And there for a while I thought well hell it's enriched.  It must be better.  
**[1:53:28-1:53:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:53:28):**  I'm getting a better source of vitamins.  There's more.  And it seems like almost the opposite is true.  
**[1:53:36-1:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:53:36):**  That all those enriched vitamins and minerals that they put into our food, yes technically  we're getting over 100% of the USDA recommended daily allowance which I mean you can probably  tell me how much of BS the number that is.  
**[1:53:50-1:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:53:50):**  Well I can tell you for vitamin D it's off by a factor of 10.  If you need vitamin D go outside.  What I'm saying is like are the minerals they're putting in as quote enriched minerals are  
**[1:54:05-1:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:05):**  they bioavailable at all or are we just bypassing those through our bodies?  Well it's interesting so for let's use folic acid as an example.  So folate comes from usually from leafy green vegetables foliage.  
**[1:54:20-1:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:20):**  So what is it it's one of the B vitamins.  What's it critical for?  Oh man I mean for a ton of things.  
**[1:54:27-1:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:27):**  Life.  I mean your whole methylation and transulfuration pathway requires B vitamins to even work.  That went right over my head.  
**[1:54:34-1:54:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:34):**  So think about like all those things your liver does if you didn't have B vitamins you  couldn't do it.  So they're vital amino they're vital meaning we can't we can't manufacture them we've got  
**[1:54:42-1:54:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:42):**  to take them in.  So mote folic acid isn't really what our body uses.  Our body uses folate and actually we have to methylate it over four we have to methylate  
**[1:54:53-1:55:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:54:53):**  it four times into a methyl tetrahydrofolate for it to be bioavailable.  So folic acid is not the same as folate.  So folic is what we fortify food with and about 60% of the population has some genes  
**[1:55:13-1:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:55:13):**  that make that difficult for some people.  Those are called the mthfr genes.  So there's two mthfr genes and if you you know this is getting way deep in the weeds  
**[1:55:23-1:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:55:23):**  it can be complicated.  But if you have that that gene snip which is single nucleotide polymorphism it could  make it so that folic acid is harder for your body to process.  
**[1:55:36-1:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:55:36):**  So this is just an example of how going back to we can't really do it better than what  nature has done.  And I think it's hubris for us as humans to go I can make a better insulin than humans  
**[1:55:48-1:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:55:48):**  can make.  Which is why the price of insulin is so high right now is we're using insulin analogs.  Which is a better than human insulin meaning it works faster than human insulin.  
**[1:56:01-1:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:01):**  What does it allow that diabetic to do?  Well eat more crap.  Cake and keep their blood sugars down because it works faster.  
**[1:56:09-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:09):**  So you can drink that soda and I mean not that you would want a diabetic.  That scene in like the end of the world movies where they go and they eat all the food and  then they go and drink this stuff that makes them throw up so they can go eat more.  
**[1:56:24-1:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:24):**  Oh that's a what's that in the Hunger Games series?  Hunger Games yeah I couldn't think of that.  Yeah they do that's a big scene where they're eating all that fancy food and then I mean  
**[1:56:32-1:56:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:32):**  you know.  Isn't that something the Greeks would do too?  Yeah.  
**[1:56:35-1:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:35):**  Yeah yeah that actually had basis in real life.  Worked well for their culture didn't it?  Yeah.  
**[1:56:39-1:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:39):**  Yeah so so so a lot of the stuff we're fortifying with is industrial forms of vitamins that  might not be bioavailable or might not even be best form for you.  I think that's one of the questions I asked you when we went to Wichita.  
**[1:56:52-1:57:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:56:52):**  You were randomly walking around and we were talking about vitamins and cereal and I'd  asked you where did that come from and you're like well where does it come from?  Like does anybody really know where do all those where does the folic acid come from?  
**[1:57:06-1:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:57:06):**  When it's enriched with vitamins and minerals where do the vitamins and minerals come from?  You know interestingly some of them are derived from corn.  Imagine that.  
**[1:57:16-1:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:57:16):**  Yeah vitamin C a lot of vitamin C in fortified foods is from corn derived vitamin C.  I bet a lot of I bet a lot of stuff comes and then I mean then even if it is available  is it worth absorbing into your body?  
**[1:57:29-1:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:57:29):**  And how much different effect on the body does and this is something we talked about  earlier about like molecules and without naming a specific molecule just a molecule that affects  the body like if a bond is five degrees off or if it's a mirrored molecule like there's  
**[1:57:48-1:58:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:57:48):**  a left hand and a right hand molecule and they can be chemically identical.  Just mirrored and they can have completely different effects on the body that we don't  even understand why.  
**[1:58:00-1:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:58:00):**  Yeah the isomers or the enantiomers yeah it's pretty it I know the biochemistry of the body  is amazing all fascinating.  My favorite machine I think bodies are awesome.  
**[1:58:12-1:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:58:12):**  Yeah they really are cool but yeah the what yeah why are we fortifying food and you know  like it was funny brought up white bread I was at that dinner for it was a it was the  where the Land It's To was the hosting this dinner at Eldersley Farm.  
**[1:58:31-1:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:58:31):**  It's a local farm next to us that they make some of the most amazing meals and the we  were having this bread that was a sourdough bread that took 48 hours to rise and it was  made with that Kernza grain and it was this rich dense crusty bread that was unlike anything  
**[1:58:51-1:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:58:51):**  you would find in a store and we were eating with a guy who had grown up in England and  he was talking about how the hit I think it was maybe his family said that they were they  were so poor that they had to make their own bread and what he yearned for was the store  
**[1:59:09-1:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:59:09):**  bought white bread because he associated that with wealth.  Yeah and so you know he remembers we have to eat this crusty dark and heavy bread.  I said it earlier microwave oven I think there's a whole generation like that.  
**[1:59:25-1:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:59:25):**  Yeah so so it's interesting to him in his in his cultural background and mindset and  going through the Great Depression or whatever they went through he knew they couldn't afford  to go buy Wonder Bread and Wonder Bread was the thing he was like that's the pinnacle  
**[1:59:38-1:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:59:38):**  of bread and I look at that and go that is junk.  Isn't it crazy that when you're when you're at your poorest the thing that your body and  your brain has the will to do is to make bread that doesn't suck for you.  
**[1:59:50-2:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=1:59:50):**  Yeah and and you know it's interesting the way we make bread in the United States is  bread rises in like 30 minutes 30 minutes to an hour and we're baking it and we don't  have time to wait we're not waiting two days for bread to rise.  
**[2:00:01-2:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:01):**  Doesn't ferment.  Right we're adding yeast to it whereas the.  We add yeast and we add sugar to make the yeast work faster right you know if you took  
**[2:00:09-2:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:09):**  any almost any bread that we bake here and took it to France they would call it a dessert  you could not legally call it bread because of French bread law.  French bread law says if you put any sugar in it.  
**[2:00:22-2:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:22):**  It's dessert.  It's dessert and it's not bread.  Yeah yeah and why why are we pumping high fructose corn syrup in the Roman meal.  
**[2:00:29-2:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:29):**  Why is that even on the label.  I think the fermentation process of sourdough bread makes your body way more likely to digest  all of that gluten.  
**[2:00:37-2:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:37):**  Oh yeah.  It's nasty from eating gluten you don't have the problems.  Well and I and I don't even know if it's gluten it might be.  
**[2:00:43-2:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:43):**  I have this theory that people who have what's called non celiac gluten sensitivity which  is meaning they don't have the celiac disease they don't have the genetic disease celiac  but yet they get sick when they eat bread so we lumped those in a category called non  
**[2:00:56-2:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:00:56):**  celiac gluten sensitivity.  Is there even a remote possibility that is like herbicide or pesticide reaction or toxicity.  It's a good question because and here's the observation that I've made is those same patients  
**[2:01:08-2:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:01:08):**  can say you know when I go to Europe and eat the bread I don't have any problem at all.  It's fermented it's the same to me as like milk.  Yeah they're made so so then you then you have to say well okay what's the difference  
**[2:01:20-2:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:01:20):**  so in Europe they're air fermenting their bread for three sometimes five days so they  don't add yeast the yeast just comes from the air it's just naturally attracted in.  And they don't need to feed the yeast with a bunch of sugar.  
**[2:01:31-2:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:01:31):**  They don't need to feed the yeast so so the yeast is living off of the fructans that are  in the grain which is sugar that's in bread and they're breaking those fructans down so  that when you eat the bread in Europe maybe it's that you have a fructans sensitivity  
**[2:01:43-2:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:01:43):**  or you know to your point maybe it's a glyphosate.  You know and we're not supposed to put glyphosate on wheat right but yet I've understood that  they spray glyphosate on wheat either after harvest or maybe as a to.  
**[2:01:56-2:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:01:56):**  Well when you harvest and you go out.  To dry it out is that right?  You harvest and you go out and you you know maybe take your wheat straw and then maybe  
**[2:02:03-2:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:03):**  you go out like six months or 30 to three weeks later and you got to till it all up  and then you got to let the weeds grow and then you got to spray the weeds.  Yeah yeah so they might not be technically spraying the wheat plant while it's growing  
**[2:02:15-2:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:15):**  right.  Yeah because it'll kill the wheat but they do spray those chemicals in the fields and  the chemical stays in the soil because I mean a lot of these chemicals let's face it they're  
**[2:02:25-2:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:25):**  kind of forever chemicals.  Well I mean if you read the label Roundup's gone from your soil and the same as antibiotics  and cows this is the same way so I think a lot of that is not coming from being sprayed  
**[2:02:37-2:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:37):**  on the wheat it's coming from the fact that we don't we don't talk about the fact that  the soil that's in the field before the wheat gets there.  Yeah that's a good point.  
**[2:02:44-2:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:44):**  Is where your junk comes from.  And I actually heard a theory that that's why we're having we have so many peanut allergies  is that peanuts are grown they typically grow peanuts in cotton fields and cotton fields  
**[2:02:53-2:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:53):**  are heavily sprayed.  Heavily sprayed.  Heavily sprayed with everything.  
**[2:02:57-2:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:02:57):**  And the dirt you know again the unspoken secret is it's not the peanuts that's the problem.  The whole reason I think about gluten sensitivity is up until 10 years ago there were some celiacs  in the world that couldn't eat wheat.  
**[2:03:14-2:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:14):**  Yeah.  But it's like all of a sudden 10 years ago 50 percent of the country is sensitive to  gluten.  
**[2:03:21-2:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:21):**  Bullshit.  Right.  That didn't happen overnight.  
**[2:03:24-2:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:24):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  Our genetics don't change that fast.  
**[2:03:27-2:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:27):**  We don't we don't have a drift in our genes in a generation.  So there's something else at work.  It's not just celiac.  
**[2:03:33-2:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:33):**  It's got to be environmental.  There's something environmental that we're doing to our food because I mean the link  is there.  
**[2:03:40-2:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:40):**  Yeah.  So what's the link that's there?  I mean and for me that points back to production practice and chemical use on the land to grow  
**[2:03:49-2:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:49):**  the food.  Possibly.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:52-2:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:52):**  Like I mean who's going to investigate that and actually draw that conclusion.  We are.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:57-2:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:03:57):**  Those are the questions we we need to ask.  These people are asking that people don't ask.  Like I was surprised when I asked you that question and you were calling like hmm I don't  
**[2:04:05-2:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:05):**  know for sure.  Because because people assume that that people know the answers to all these questions so  nobody does ask.  
**[2:04:13-2:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:13):**  I was reading a book book the other day about about about gardening and the guy talked a  lot about how he gardens so different than everyone else and the reason he started gardening  that way was because in his mind the way you learned how to do things was you look at how  
**[2:04:29-2:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:29):**  everybody else is doing it and you see what they're not doing and you try that.  Yeah.  And see why it doesn't work rather than going and saying these things don't work.  
**[2:04:38-2:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:38):**  These things don't work.  So investigating new things.  Educating the negatives necessarily.  
**[2:04:43-2:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:43):**  You know.  Try it.  So ask the questions.  
**[2:04:47-2:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:47):**  Who's asking who's going to do these studies.  I don't know.  Yeah.  
**[2:04:50-2:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:04:50):**  Well I think again I think it's about educating the individual right through through the power  of podcasting through the power of getting more doctors clued into what regenerative  and functional integrative medicine looks like so we can begin thinking about these  
**[2:05:04-2:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:04):**  problems and then as we make a better consumer.  So they're actually asking hey where is this beef coming from.  Like you know my patients said they only asked Whole Foods about this grass bedding as well  
**[2:05:14-2:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:14):**  it's grass fed but it's grain finished and from New Zealand probably.  Yeah yeah.  I mean who knows where it comes from.  
**[2:05:20-2:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:20):**  Like I remember Joel Salatin talking about how we we take chickens and we ship them over  to China to be slaughtered put on styrofoam plates wrapped in cellophane and shipped back.  It's like why are we doing that.  
**[2:05:32-2:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:32):**  It's somebody's making a lot of money doing it.  That's yeah somebody's making a lot of money doing it.  And somebody is being exploited too in the process.  
**[2:05:40-2:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:40):**  Yeah they're probably doing it because the labor's cheaper there.  You said something really interesting about making a better consumer.  I think that's what like this whole thing is about because if the consumer is not asking  
**[2:05:51-2:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:05:51):**  for the product the farmer and rancher isn't going to be able to provide it.  And right you are in a great place to help create better consumers because people trust  you when you talk about their food.  
**[2:06:02-2:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:02):**  And people don't necessarily trust farmers when we talk about their food because we're  farmers we're not doctors.  And doctors right now have an interesting dilemma because they have all these sick people  
**[2:06:12-2:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:12):**  and all these opportunities to do that.  And I think it's pretty awesome that you're taking that opportunity to teach.  My goal is to work myself out of a job.  
**[2:06:22-2:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:22):**  If I'm doing my job right you don't need me.  Yes.  Or you need me less.  
**[2:06:26-2:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:26):**  Yeah.  And that's what the medical field should be.  It shouldn't be a trap of continued treatment.  
**[2:06:32-2:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:32):**  Like you know like the self-manufactured diabetes obesity epidemic that has created what what's  the percentage 20 percent of the people in this country are type 2 diabetic or pre diabetic  and need insulin?  
**[2:06:46-2:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:46):**  So greater and greater than 40 percent right now are pre diabetic.  40 percent are pre diabetic.  So every other person you meet is either diabetic or on their way to it.  
**[2:06:57-2:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:06:57):**  Well there's four of us in this room.  So there's there's odds that two of us there's good odds that one of us for sure.  I know I've been there.  
**[2:07:05-2:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:05):**  I've been on I've been on that I've been on that page before five years ago probably to  the point where I wasn't my body and my health absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[2:07:13-2:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:13):**  And this is one reason we measure glucose and insulin fasting in almost everybody is  we want to find it.  We want to find that insulin resistant signal before it becomes diabetes.  
**[2:07:21-2:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:21):**  Right.  Right.  I mean you're you're wanting to figure out problems on your property.  
**[2:07:27-2:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:27):**  You know you're looking at water very carefully so that you don't have to run into a drought  later on where you can't figure out where you're going to get water from.  Right.  
**[2:07:36-2:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:36):**  You're think you've got to be thinking ahead.  And so doctors need to be thinking that too is like OK well how if 40 percent of people  are walking with pre diabetes I need to find out who that 40 percent is and start making  
**[2:07:46-2:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:46):**  a change.  But it doesn't seem like any of your colleagues are with you on that.  Your colleagues are like well we'll just insulin is expensive we need to work to try to bring  
**[2:07:55-2:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:07:55):**  down the cost of insulin.  So that's where the consumer thing comes into play.  And I was going to ask this so like as a friend as a person to your people when you hear your  
**[2:08:04-2:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:04):**  friends inevitably come to you and complain because they had a horrible experience with  the doctor and they didn't get what they wanted done and they blah blah blah blah blah.  Right.  
**[2:08:12-2:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:12):**  I try to remind my friends or my people that I talk to that your doctor is somebody you're  going to for business.  So you go in have a plan and have a goal in mind and go in and say this is what I want.  
**[2:08:25-2:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:25):**  This is why I'm here.  This is what I need.  Rather than coming in and saying I don't want this anymore.  
**[2:08:29-2:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:29):**  I don't want to feel this headache anymore.  I don't want to do this.  This food makes me sick.  
**[2:08:34-2:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:34):**  Instead of looking at all these this is that what do you want.  And then find a doctor that will work with you to get to that place rather than trying  to fit into a system that isn't giving you what you want.  
**[2:08:47-2:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:47):**  Well and I have a lot of sympathy for the doctors you're still practicing under an insurance  model because I know what that feels like.  It's a it's it's demoralizing.  
**[2:08:56-2:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:08:56):**  I mean it really really is tough.  I mean physician burnout is at an all time high physician suicides high.  I mean I have a wheel.  
**[2:09:04-2:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:04):**  Yeah I mean I've talked to friends of mine that went to residency with and they're like  I don't see myself doing this another 10 years.  And I'm like well we're going to not have doctors like surely kids don't want to get  
**[2:09:14-2:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:14):**  into this now you know.  Yeah I know and people say so I'm thinking about going to medicine.  What do you think.  
**[2:09:19-2:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:19):**  I'm like well I don't know I'd count those costs real carefully.  One of my best friends is an E.R. nurse and she loves her job and she's thought about  you know doing life flight stuff and she's brilliant.  
**[2:09:31-2:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:31):**  And I asked her the other day she should go back to school and she's like no I can make  way more money being a nurse and have way less stress and responsibility and headaches  because I don't have all the overhead costs.  
**[2:09:42-2:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:42):**  Yes you go to school for four years and then you go to med school for four years and then  residency for three years up to seven years depending on what you're doing and all that  while you're delaying your earning potential you're also delaying when you can start saving  
**[2:09:54-2:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:09:54):**  you're delaying your retirement.  You're racking up student loan interest.  Yeah a quarter million dollars average now is what students are coming out of med school  
**[2:10:02-2:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:02):**  with and now you know and you're and then you're put into the grinder.  I think a 2021 med school grad will still be paying on med school debt in 2061.  That's crazy.  
**[2:10:14-2:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:14):**  Well if you do it right and you do things like that in the medical field right and you  get in with some the right people you can get a lot of school paid for but that doesn't  help when you get out into the world and it's a grinder right.  
**[2:10:24-2:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:24):**  Does it help?  Yeah so I do I have a lot of sympathy for my colleagues and I guess you know I hope  that they I hope that they they find that path that helps them find more value in their  
**[2:10:35-2:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:35):**  work and brings back that the dignity of that patient physician relationship.  That's that patient to physician relationship in the seven and a half minute yeah let's  call it Obamacare barrier.  
**[2:10:49-2:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:49):**  Yeah.  That's that's something that we really ought to work on trying to change and we got to  wrap this up doc.  
**[2:10:57-2:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:10:57):**  So what are some what are some questions or some pointers that you could give to our listeners  of ways they could talk to their doctor in that seven to seven and a half minutes that  they're going to get with them to try to get better health guidance.  
**[2:11:12-2:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:11:12):**  Oh man.  Or is it just or is it just ditch that guy and find somebody like you.  Be a better consumer.  
**[2:11:20-2:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:11:20):**  Be a better consumer.  Find a doctor who will talk to you about diet and lifestyle who won't who won't give you  pill for problem.  
**[2:11:26-2:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:11:26):**  Find a doctor who's actually done some who find a doctor who continues to be a lifelong  learner.  Find a doctor who continues to read the research who continues to be involved in what's developing.  
**[2:11:38-2:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:11:38):**  Find someone who's passionate about what they do that has that's purpose driven.  That's going to be the doctor you want to you want to hang on to.  So I don't know in a life's too short to spend with a doctor that doesn't do that for you.  
**[2:11:54-2:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:11:54):**  And over time maybe those doctors will ask the question why isn't anybody coming to me.  That's just the same with any other any other field like capitalism works if you let it  run.  
**[2:12:04-2:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:04):**  Yeah it does.  I'm a big believer in capitalism.  Good stuff.  
**[2:12:08-2:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:08):**  All right.  Well where can we get a hold of you Dr. Jeff?  Where do you where do you want to send traffic to?  
**[2:12:13-2:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:13):**  Yeah so prayhealthandwellness.com if you want to find us there that usually gets you anywhere.  And yeah like I said we're in we're in Wichita Kansas.  Come by the office and say hi sometime.  
**[2:12:24-2:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:24):**  Any social media email address you want to put out?  I'm on Twitter as at Jeff Davis MD but we're not a Twitter.  I'm probably too political on Twitter.  
**[2:12:38-2:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:38):**  Too political.  Yeah I hesitate giving that one out but that's.  That's what Twitter's for doc.  
**[2:12:44-2:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:44):**  I have no filter on Twitter like if you just want my ranch stuff like Facebook you know  Instagram fine.  If you want more unfiltered me where I go harass people like in CBA and politicians  
**[2:12:56-2:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:12:56):**  you can come follow me on Twitter.  Probably not going to respond.  I don't ever read comments.  
**[2:13:01-2:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:01):**  I just do that for entertainment and stress relief.  Yeah that's that's right.  That's what Twitter is for me.  
**[2:13:06-2:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:06):**  I can get to follow like a few physicians and scientists that I want to hear from but  yeah.  Well Sean Baker's a good follow.  
**[2:13:12-2:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:12):**  There's some good follows on Twitter.  I think Twitter has the opportunity to be this transformative place where conversations  can can happen and the problem is they need to let them happen instead of canceling everybody.  
**[2:13:24-2:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:24):**  So I'm also as big a believer in capitalism as I am in free speech.  There you go.  I think you know well Joe Rogan says it all the time and I think he says it best when  
**[2:13:34-2:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:34):**  he says the way to combat bad speech is with better speech.  Yes.  Like we don't need to be canceling people.  
**[2:13:41-2:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:41):**  We don't need to be deplatforming people.  Make a better argument.  Make a better argument.  
**[2:13:45-2:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:45):**  Exactly.  And if you can't make a better argument if your arguments don't stand up maybe you're  bullshit.  
**[2:13:50-2:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:50):**  Yeah maybe your idea is not good.  I mean if you can't if your argument can't stand on its own if you cannot defend your  argument without having to silence the other party do you have an argument?  
**[2:13:59-2:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:13:59):**  I love it.  Well thank you for having me on.  This has been fun.

**[2:14:07-2:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:14:07):**  Yeah it was great morning and really really enjoyed the time we spent together.  Appreciate you coming down doc and appreciate you doing this.  Thank you.  
**[2:14:14-2:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/58-Dr-Jeff-Davis-Food-is-medicine-e1gg3va#t=2:14:14):**  And as always guys enjoy the rest your week.

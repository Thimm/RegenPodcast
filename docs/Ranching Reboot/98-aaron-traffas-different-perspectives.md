**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:00:00):**  Hey gang, welcome back for another episode of your favorite Rejournavag podcast,  Ranching Reboot.

I'm a picky eater and it's been a struggle my  
**[0:00:28-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:00:28):**  whole life to fuel my body properly. When I got curious about nutrition, I asked my doctor about  vitamins and that led to a conversation about where vitamins come from. He didn't know and  I realized I needed to make a change so I started searching for a better source of high quality  
**[0:00:41-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:00:41):**  nutritional supplements to spend my hard-earned dollars on. I reached out to several companies  and I'm proud to announce a partnership with a company I can stand behind. Introducing One Earth  Health grass-fed beef organ supplements. Organ meats are the most nutrient-dense foods we can  
**[0:00:55-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:00:55):**  eat and have been uniquely treasured by our ancestors. Organ meats are not only nutrient-dense  but they're also a great source of essential vitamins and minerals. The liver is packed with  vitamin A, K, and E while the heart is a great natural source of COQ10. The spleen contains four  
**[0:01:09-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:01:09):**  times the amount of iron as the liver and the kidney is a great source of vitamin B complex.  The pancreas supports gut health. I can't tell you how much better I feel since I started taking  these supplements. When I don't take them, I have much less energy and focus. Just a few capsules  
**[0:01:22-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:01:22):**  every morning gives me everything my body needs to thrive.

I just kind of threw some in the corners and like I  sat there and looked like okay what looks like it's gonna bounce a sound wave. I'll just go  okay put one there and put one there and put one there and put one there. And so I'm underneath  
**[0:02:55-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:02:55):**  Tanya's office and kind of kind of underneath her office in the dining room and every once in a  while I'll get some pretty she'll start cleaning and okay moving the chairs that's not a big deal.  Don't vacuum. You can't vacuum. You vacuum it blows out all my microphones and there's no way  
**[0:03:16-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:03:16):**  around that. Your volume is going to be that big number four knob there if you want to adjust it  higher or lower for whatever your ear preference is.  And this mic sounds good. It's a good mic. I've also got it. Let's see what your EQ curve is here  
**[0:03:35-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:03:35):**  on it. Where's my mouse? So you are here. I've got it EQed there. You want to say something.  It's kind of cool to watch it. Testing, testing, one, two, three. Welcome to Ranching Reboot. I'm  your host Red Hills Rancher. This is episode 90 whatever. 90 bleep in the blorp. Who's it and what's  
**[0:03:55-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:03:55):**  it? Yeah, I don't know. I don't keep track. I don't even I don't make those announcements because it's  too much of a like I know I'll screw something up editing or something will happen. We'll have to  change episode numbers every almost every time I've tried to do an episode number in the intro  
**[0:04:11-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:04:11):**  it's turned out to be wrong. So fix it in post. Yep. Yeah. Hang on just a minute. Let me make sure.  So I'm recording each channel twice. One is the the raw audio from the microphone and one is  after all of these effects that I have here the gate and the compressor and the EQ. Post mixer.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah that's a that's that's a lot more of a mixer board than I have. I just I run a little  RODECaster Pro 2. I just picked it up a couple months ago and it's a it's a lot simpler to operate.  You know I need things that are going to be a little bit simpler to operate because  
**[0:04:49-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:04:49):**  well I'm not a musician. So do you like it? I've been toying with the idea of a mixer board.  With the idea of replacing this rig with just you know something that is purpose-built for that  there are a couple of things that are that are keeping me from doing that. One of those is the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:05:07):**  the ability to run the live stream and interact with with the computer in here. Because we do so  much live streaming it's you know the the RODECaster by understanding is built more for  the recording of the podcast and not necessarily video switching. I think that's right but they  
**[0:05:24-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:05:24):**  did come out with the RODECaster Pro 2 and I had an original one and I you know I passed that on  to another guy that was starting up a podcast and I got a 2 not long after they came out. And  like for my purposes for what I do for my podcast it was real super easy to get it set up. Like  
**[0:05:44-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:05:44):**  you know settings imported everything imported and it and it sounds the same. I can set it up  to sound the same or it sounds the same out of the box but it's got more toys it's got you know  filters it's got a bigger sound bank that's programmable. And you can do a lot of the  
**[0:06:01-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:06:01):**  mixing. I'm not sure if you can do like the software like you have up there like the the  specific EQ curve to match it to a mic and tune a room. I don't know if it'll do all that but  it it's a lot easier for me for me to set up and operate with you know my little bit lower  
**[0:06:18-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:06:18):**  over skill level. Sure. Well we're here in we're not in my studio if you couldn't tell by the sound  of my voice through a microphone we're not in my studio so where are we? We're in we're in in my  air studio south of Sharon Kansas about about a mile south of Sharon in the in the basement of  
**[0:06:40-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:06:40):**  my farmhouse where I have converted a room to purpose-built streaming and recording.  I like I mean this is better than mine I'm like getting ideas and I'm probably going to get some  get some pictures so I guess before we get going if anybody read the title they know your name but  
**[0:06:56-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:06:56):**  who are you guy? I'm Aaron Trafas and I I farm here south of south of Sharon on on you know  legacy family operation fourth generation farmer here south of Sharon. Cool cool and  well the intro music you provided the intro music for me as well do you want to talk about that for  
**[0:07:16-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:07:16):**  a few seconds? Sure I one of one of the many irons I have in the fire is is fronting the Aaron  Trafas band and we play our our original it's tough to pigeonhole the music you know and  everything I everything I understand about music is when you can't describe it then you're somewhere  
**[0:07:32-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:07:32):**  in the mushy middle which which doesn't necessarily have a marketable a marketable audience but we  call it we call it anthemic Americana or ag rock or you know various terms that we have tried to  to come up with and claim but it's essentially alternative country music and and whenever we  
**[0:07:49-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:07:49):**  come out of the studio we we grab a an instrument only mix an instrumental mix and you were kind  enough to leverage that as the as the intro stinger for and the outro sometimes for your  free podcast. It's it's actually I don't think I've missed putting it in as the outro it's just  
**[0:08:08-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:08:08):**  the last like minute minute and a half and it's kind in the background sometimes it might be a  little bit hard to hear but yeah I think I had somebody one time say that it was a what do you  say punk rock country I really like that punk rock country intro you got going on I said well thanks  
**[0:08:27-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:08:27):**  that's uh it was graciously provided by my friend Aaron at the Aaron Trafas band. So sometimes I  so sometimes I sometimes I record commercial for shows that I have upcoming and one of the guys  that I've run around with playing music for forever since we were roommates back in in  
**[0:08:42-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:08:42):**  Manhattan is Lucas Matti and sometimes I let him write copy for these these commercials and I think  he once wrote punk country prince or something like that trying to be trying to be cute and so  that's not the first time I've heard it called punk country. Yeah I can see that I can definitely  
**[0:09:00-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:09:00):**  see that and I hate writing ad copy it's like hopefully hopefully uh y'all didn't hear the  same old ads I've been running for the last month and I actually recorded new ad copy for this one.  That's something that in another life I have a lot of experience with.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:09:19):**  I'm gonna admit I'm gonna admit right now uh so have you heard about that chat GPT program  the AI program? Absolutely. You know it'll write ad copy for you? I bet it will. Just give it a  couple bullet points and say write ad copy. Something I've been kind of messing with it  
**[0:09:37-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:09:37):**  the last couple days I think the last thing I asked it to do is was write a comparative analysis  about different farming methods as they relate to soil health and human health and  it you put in something like that and it just it takes about two seconds to think and it just  
**[0:09:55-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:09:55):**  starts throwing text on the page and it's scary if you guys don't know what we're talking about  there's a there's a artificial intelligence chat program out there called chat GPT and I think it  has all the knowledge of the universe prior to like 2021. So you can ask it questions about  
**[0:10:16-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:10:16):**  people you can ask it ask it to write a paper in the style of of like the King James Bible and  it'll do it. It's it's a pretty amazing program. And it's not limited to just you know copy right  we so so you were you were a guest once on our little Sunday Sunday show the what we call our  
**[0:10:34-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:10:34):**  Sunday service group which is a group that started in 2020 and the reason this studio exists because  you know we will start our third year of every Sunday night streaming meetings here in another  couple of months and as you remember every Sunday we have a different and unique game on there and  
**[0:10:52-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:10:52):**  so chat GPT was a subject a couple of weeks ago we were playing with it and said write a song in  the style of Bob Dylan about whatever topic we put it and it does it and it's ridiculous and so you  know we have like I said we have a game and the guy that generates these games thought he could  
**[0:11:10-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:11:10):**  use it to do help with the game and so it was kind of a trivia thing and he said write these trivia  questions and it did and he thought well maybe I can take it a step further okay chat GPT write  the code to build this game in node.js or whatever language he was using at the time and it did and  
**[0:11:26-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:11:26):**  he just copies it and pastes it in and we have our game that this thing wrote that used to take him  hours and now he just comes up with the prompt and it generates it. And it's not like he has to  go debug it because it's a perfect AI. Well we find bugs let's just put it that way.  
**[0:11:42-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:11:42):**  You could probably use it to debug it. It will get better yes absolutely.  Yeah and things like that things like that are very very interesting you know from an overall  like society point of view of society like you know okay how is this technology going to be used  
**[0:12:00-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:12:00):**  in society? How are people going to leverage this technology to do good things instead of doing  evil things or doing bad things in the world? And like some of the chatter that I've seen is  like professors university professors are really upset about these AI chat programs and I can see  
**[0:12:20-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:12:20):**  why. Like I could definitely see why like well let's write a doctoral dissertation on the  difference between you know A and B and the program will do it for you. And you know you  turn that into your professor yeah we're giving everybody ideas on how to cheat at college.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:12:37):**  But you give that to your professor and how is he going to know if you wrote it or an AI wrote it?  Right one of the other challenging components to this as someone who wants to see this  promising technology improve over time is that they say that that right now we're kind of at  
**[0:12:54-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:12:54):**  an inflection point in content availability on the internet. These programs these AIs require  in order to learn and improve they require a corpus of information to study and work through  and parse and figure out things. Well now that we've released all of these AIs into content  
**[0:13:13-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:13:13):**  generation on the internet there's so much of this content that's generated that future AIs  and training them is going to be very difficult because you know it's kind of garbage in garbage  out and so the AIs of today that are writing all of this content that will be scraped by future AIs  
**[0:13:28-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:13:28):**  they are not going to be able to learn as quickly and as as good because they face the same problems  as those university professors and being able to tell what is actually useful human-generated  content and what is made by today's you know arguably nascent or inexperienced AIs.  
**[0:13:46-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:13:46):**  You know that that I think that's a great point you know we're going to maybe we won't be able  to tell in the future what's what's human-generated and what's AI-generated and maybe  there won't be a difference. Maybe it is we have passed that inflection point where AI is already  
**[0:14:06-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:14:06):**  you know exerting an irrevocable influence on our culture and we just can't see it. You know  Google they've been using AI for years. Amazon uses AI to predict what you're gonna buy. They  use AI to stock their warehouses ahead of time for what they think people are gonna buy in an area.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:14:25):**  You know that that's nothing new. Well there's there's also some some flexibility in what the  term AI means right. Your Amazon AI is simply a an algorithm that is you know continuously  improved by you know as as the humans notice inefficiencies they will they will go in and  
**[0:14:43-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:14:43):**  improve it and you know something like a chat GPT a general AI you know is is you know a next level  you could say and there are there are there are distinctions and this is you know it's it's  something that interests me but it's not my wheelhouse you know the difference between a  
**[0:14:58-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:14:58):**  neural network and an AI and algorithms and all of those different terms that describe different  permutations of computer intelligence or artificial intelligence. I read a book once like yes I can  read folks I know this might be shocking and it was it was set kind of near future hard sci-fi  
**[0:15:21-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:15:21):**  which you know I like to consume that kind of content from time to time.  Absolutely.  And he called them artificial stupid.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:15:31):**  That's that's fun.  And it was if maybe a few more minutes I'll actually remember the author in the book but the  the premise was they didn't ever they could never replicate the infinite complexity of human mind  
**[0:15:49-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:15:49):**  and human thought in a computer so they just backtracked and said okay we're going to build  these specific stupid intelligences to do specific tasks and okay I can kind of see that but that  requires a sort of restraint that I don't see very much in the world these days.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:16:11):**  No. No if there's one thing that humanity has shown it's a it's a blatant  inability to exercise restraint.  Oh man so many rabbit trails to chase. So where do you see  
**[0:16:29-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:16:29):**  I'm trying to figure out how to tie in this artificial intelligence discussion back into  farming and food systems. I'm not sure how we're going to get there. I mean I think we see some some  of these smart technologies and and intelligences I can kind of see them going that way like you  
**[0:16:52-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:16:52):**  know there's been a big push in the last couple years trying to figure out how to do that.  Okay I get that you know being a grain cart operator can be very busy can be very thankless you get blamed  for a lot of shit that goes wrong because you're never in the right spot you know somebody's always  
**[0:17:14-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:17:14):**  waiting on you didn't get the truck right you're spilled a little bit I can see okay let's replace  that with a let's replace that with an AI. Well what's the next step? Well we can replace the guy  in the combine pretty much with an AI. I mean the the new John Deere combines that are well over a  
**[0:17:31-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:17:31):**  half a million dollars that I don't know how well they work but apparently you set one in the field  have the GPS guidance set up press a button to get it started cutting and then press a button to where  it automatically adjusts itself and you're just you're not even a steering wheel holder at that  
**[0:17:49-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:17:49):**  point you can just sit there and watch Netflix all day and let the and let the machine do the work so  like how many more manual tasks are there that we can automate or or what's left on the farm  that they're not going to try to replace us with a machine or with with an AI? Sure well I mean  
**[0:18:11-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:18:11):**  you mentioned the driverless grain cart stuff I mean that's something that you know three or  four years ago I was you know playing around on Twitter and finding some some farmers who  were experimenting with you know putting Arduino boards and microcontrollers and actually building  
**[0:18:25-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:18:25):**  things in cabs to remote control it from the combine right using some kind of remote mechanism  to pull it alongside and control speed and and make turns and things but you know the next  evolution that I've seen recently is the introduction of cabless remote AI farming tractors  
**[0:18:43-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:18:43):**  from you know Case IH recently released theirs you know a couple of years ago you know and so  it's not just a you know be in the cab and let the machine do its work it's you can be elsewhere  you know or you can be in a cab tractor in one field and have a second machine in the same field  
**[0:19:00-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:19:00):**  doing doing its work or in another field so we're there. Just takes money. It takes a lot of money.  Takes a lot of money which oh man that's that's a whole other subject that we could get into is  profitability and you know the get big get out mentality and what it's going to take in the  
**[0:19:18-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:19:18):**  future and I think that's that's a whole whole other giant can of worms that we don't want to  get into right now. So let's let's circle back and let's let's talk about the Trafus farm here in the  Sheeran Valley. What I know we've talked previously we've talked several times over the last couple  
**[0:19:36-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:19:36):**  years and I think you made the comment that back in the summer that you thought that you're you'd  been doing some things that were kind of progressive here in the valley based on you know  other folks around you want to talk about some of those? Sure well to set the table a little bit  
**[0:19:54-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:19:54):**  you know I grew up on the farm obviously and we were basically weed on weed on weed and  conventional tillage practices and I went to college and would come back for for harvest  but that was really the extent of my involvement in the farm from you know for for 10 years it was  
**[0:20:15-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:20:15):**  just coming back during harvest and then my father died suddenly in 2012 and I found myself with farm  to run and no institutional knowledge to fall back on it was just me and so I was trying to  to figure out how to you know not completely crash into the mountain right away and so I obviously  
**[0:20:34-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:20:34):**  picked up the farming practices that I knew them to be there in 2012 and started going to  conferences and things like that and quickly learned that you know moldboard plow and you know  burn plow weed on weed that was probably unsustainable and you know I'm still convinced  
**[0:20:52-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:20:52):**  of that and realized that I wanted to make the transition to a no-till and a crop rotation and  the reason that you know it's not that dad didn't know that that was not the the greatest practice  but we had such a rye problem and you do anytime you do monocrop after monocrop and it's the same  
**[0:21:08-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:21:08):**  same crop you have you have weed challenges and so I knew that rotation was the way to to solve that  and I think I plowed a thousand acres in 2014 and we had a big two-inch range shortly thereafter and  I watched a lot of topsoil go away and I realized that was not something I wanted to do again  
**[0:21:27-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:21:27):**  and so I looked at making the you know how fast could I make a reasonable transition to  no-till and commenced that and I think that the last time I did large-scale tillage was in 2015  I bought a ripper and I ripped everything because I was worried about the compaction layer right the  
**[0:21:44-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:21:44):**  the hard pan that came from the years of plowing and so I bought a ripper and I ripped every acre  and then I sold the ripper the same year and bought a no-till drill and you know started  started using that going forward and you know a year or two later bought a planter and  
**[0:22:02-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:22:02):**  a no-till planter or at least a planter that was was able to handle no-till practices I don't think  that at the time my planter was built they did much no-till but in any case that's kind of when  I when I began making the transition was at that time and as far as the the things that got some  
**[0:22:21-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:22:21):**  people raising eyebrows you know around the the valley the Sharon valley that that we're in  was the cover crop stuff you know and part of what kind of cover crops are you putting in so  it it's always been a with with one small exception a multi-species mix and that was  
**[0:22:42-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:22:42):**  that was part of the part of the the FSA programs the NRCS stuff when I when I knew that I wanted  to make the transition I knew I was going to make the transition you know full stop but was made  aware that there were some some programs available to to help and I know that there's plenty in your  
**[0:23:01-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:23:01):**  community and you yourself are not huge fans of FSA and NRCS I get that but I found it to be very  invaluable you know in the in the transition and everything that I read at the time you know when  you when you go from conventional tillage to no-till it takes a few years to get the the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:23:18):**  ground used to it and nutrient cycling and all of the benefits don't come in the first year right  of no-till and and that was certainly the case also to take a quick step back if you remember  I picked the best time in the world to start farming in 2013 and in 2012 into 13 and 14 was  
**[0:23:37-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:23:37):**  just a monster drought yeah and I don't know if you noticed when you drove in the yard out here  there's an artesian well about 100 yards east of my back door and it has run my entire life with  two exceptions one of those it stopped in 2013 and it stopped now I didn't know there is even  
**[0:23:55-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:23:55):**  an artesian well in in this part of the world I didn't know that existed two within a mile of here  interesting and I've got one 100 yards east right here right right at the corner out here is is a  well that normally there's always water there and you know in the winter it's it's it's always great  
**[0:24:09-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:24:09):**  because it's always fresh you know there's live water and so we get all the birds and everything  even when everything's frozen over there's always water coming out and so it's it's it's great  this is the only the second time in my life that it stopped it was 2014 at that drought  
**[0:24:22-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:24:22):**  and right now and I'm just crossing my fingers that it starts up again once we start getting  more moisture around here but in any case my point is that you know I was coming off of you know  starting farming in a drought which was extraordinarily difficult and and realizing that  
**[0:24:38-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:24:38):**  if I was going to make this transition to no-till it was probably not going to be you know three or  four years of record yields as I was trying to make this transition and so I approached NRCS  and found out that they had some some incentives in the equip and the csp programs that I that I  
**[0:24:52-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:24:52):**  enrolled in enrolled half the farm in in equip for three years and then the other half the next  three years and part of that what I found beneficial you know the the payments were there  as as a supplemental which which certainly helped in the in the relatively low yields that I was  
**[0:25:10-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:25:10):**  having during the period but what it did is is made me better in forcing the the the cover crops  and you know you've got to do at six species and it's got to you've got to have this rotation on  these acres and you know the the forced rotation and the the cover crop incentive that I signed up  
**[0:25:27-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:25:27):**  for I am I'm somebody who's really good at execution I'm not great at planning okay and so  having that make me have a plan hey it's on the books it's on the program I've got to do it I'm  gonna do it it got done and I don't know that my transition would have been as accelerated and as  
**[0:25:52-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:25:52):**  as well executed if it would have just been me without having you know someone else to report to  essentially accountability is important yes yes and and it certainly was was for me and so  having those resources there and somebody to talk to about you know about the rotations and the and  
**[0:26:12-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:26:12):**  the the cover crop planting and things like that was I found it to be extraordinarily valuable now  somebody with you know with a multi-person operation or having you know elders around  for that institutional knowledge you know maybe that's not going to be as nearly as important but  
**[0:26:27-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:26:27):**  as a as you know a beginning farmer it was it was really useful to me you know I was always really  good at executing any task dad would say go go plow that field go burn that go fix that fence  whatever but the why and the win I never never paid much attention to that and you know I spent  
**[0:26:43-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:26:43):**  you know because dad and grandpa did that they always did it and they always just told me what  needed done I got really good at doing things which is really useful because I didn't ever have  to worry about well how do I fix this combine how do I do whatever I could do everything it's just  
**[0:26:55-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:26:55):**  as far as the the what to do and the win to do it that that I was you know so so terrified you know  back in back in the early teens and the and the why of it right you know why do we do this why  do we farm why do we hook onto this tool which which also now knowing what I know now you know  
**[0:27:14-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:27:14):**  about about more sustainable practices you know I'm starting to question some of those some of  those why decisions not all of them you know because they were operating with with what they  had and and quite frankly you know I know that dad experimented with some with some alternative  
**[0:27:27-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:27:27):**  dry land crops and occasionally ran some some fall crops but quite frankly the the seed genetics are  not near what they are now to be able to to raise any kind of a useful yield back in the late 90s  dry dry land beans over at pixley you know which is a which is a between here and medicine lodge  
**[0:27:44-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:27:44):**  you know five bushels to the acres all all they could do and I don't think that was necessarily  his problem but genetics come a long way since then they have and you know so have the inputs  you might have to cut that one that's a yeah that's my wife I thought I put this phone on mute  
**[0:28:01-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:28:01):**  oh no well we're gonna leave that in I don't think I don't think you understand how lazy of an editor  I am like we'll trim up the front and maybe trim up the back and if there's anything really bad in  the middle we'll take it out I don't even have a notebook so I'm not writing down I don't even I  
**[0:28:22-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:28:22):**  don't even I can't even see a clock so it's not like I'm writing down time stamps man like no  that one will stay in very well so so circle back I think I think our ancestors you know the the  farming elders you know some are still around from from your father and grandfather's generation some  
**[0:28:44-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:28:44):**  are still around and some are still farming the way they've the way they learned how to do it in  the 40s and 50s and I think we got where we are because humans want an easy answer we want the  easy way out and if somebody comes to us that we recognize as having authority in that area so  
**[0:29:04-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:29:04):**  somebody from the university comes down and says hey I'm from the university we've done all this  research and this is the good thing to do now it doesn't matter if it's 1945 or 1995  that person coming from the university they've done things like they know things what they say  
**[0:29:27-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:29:27):**  is valid so if they say it works it must work when we've got to try it and I think people are also  looking for a silver bullet they want the easy answer they want the easy way out they want the  easy they want to hear the easy lie and not necessarily the hard complicated truth or they  
**[0:29:49-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:29:49):**  just want to have a surface understanding of something and know what the magic bullet is to  fix that does that do you understand what I'm saying I do I do I will I will challenge that  it's the it's the person and not the the idea that we that we should look at right proud skeptic that  
**[0:30:11-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:30:11):**  I am I always keep it keep an eye out or an ear out for for logical fallacies right and the  argument from authority because so and so said it it must be true is the you know that's that  ought to get your skeptical spidey sense tingling right and so we we use those authority figures to  
**[0:30:26-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:30:26):**  point us at the data that we can that we can assess as to whether or not it whether or not  it works so that's the only thing I would I would I would comment about that or you and I aren't  necessarily the the norm either that is very true we're not the meat of the bell curve that we're  
**[0:30:40-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:30:40):**  that I'm kind of trying to talk about right now but I think that like the vast majority of  operators they're just looking for an easy answer like oh what's the best breed of cows well Angus  everybody likes black cows okay you know that's a good that's a good blanket answer is it correct  
**[0:30:57-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:30:57):**  most of the time is it incorrect probably contextually incorrect in places so what do we  what do we really need to be looking at okay what's the best kind of cow well the best kind  of cow is one that fits your environment that'll raise a calf every year well I don't need to know  
**[0:31:13-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:31:13):**  all that just tell me what kind of what what breed do I need to go by what fits that and you know we  can keep trying to pile on layers of complexity and giving reasons and then like the average  person keeps wanting to dial that back and say no just just tell me what I need to do just just tell  
**[0:31:28-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:31:28):**  me what I need to change I'm kind of thinking of like there's an archetype of folks that go to like  go to grazing meetings coffee shops and you know anywhere where there's interaction where they can  ask a question from from somebody kind of famous like you'll have the one guy that wants to stop  
**[0:31:45-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:31:45):**  in the middle of the speaker's presentation and ask a very very specific question  very very specific question that they'll ask a very very specific question and what they're  looking for is they're basically trying to justify everything that they're doing and they just want  
**[0:32:03-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:32:03):**  the magic bullet that they can change to make everything work like that doesn't exist it doesn't  like there's no magic bullet we've we've we've piled on some of these practices that in theory  may be like 80 correct or would be 80 of what we should be doing but all these practices that  
**[0:32:23-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:32:23):**  aren't exactly right eventually move us in the wrong direction and we want another magic bullet  to put us back on track and I don't think it exists I think we've got to we've got to walk  backwards to a point where where the easy answers are gone does that make sense sure  
**[0:32:40-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:32:40):**  maybe maybe maybe not the easy answer but yeah we have to have to take a general step back you know  it reminds me of an example you know when I was when I was first starting out I went to a farm  journal wheat school in I don't know north of Wichita ways I was still living in Wichita at  
**[0:32:57-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:32:57):**  the time Phil Needham was there he's a big consultant he sells some planter things need a mag  but he was he was given a presentation and and the guy that you just talked about stood up in the  middle of the thing and he says well well how do we do that in our in our program he said we're  
**[0:33:15-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:33:15):**  we're full tillage and we do this and this and this and this and he just looked at him he's like  well the first thing you do is you stop tilling I didn't even didn't even hear the rest of his  question because he was like there's something that is so fundamentally broken in your operation  
**[0:33:29-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:33:29):**  that before you even think about the nutrient requirements of whatever you've got to stop this  part first oh well we can't stop that because if we stop that then this happens and this happens  and this happens and this happens and this happens right like no you missed the entire point here  
**[0:33:43-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:33:43):**  guy just stop that practice and then you don't have to worry about the rest of these things  and go do this other thing and those other things won't be a problem it's like it's like we are we  are trying to take a branch in the road and we need to back up six branches before because if  
**[0:33:59-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:33:59):**  we take the right turn back there then this little branch we're concerned around down here we never  get to yeah yeah exactly and it you know and and I can draw some parallels with that like  you know we talk about antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistant diseases okay  
**[0:34:19-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:34:19):**  well we can't open that can of worms and not say that okay maybe there's antibiotic resistant  diseases and pathogens in our fields in our food supply because we've overused these quote big guns  like I'll just go ahead and say glyphosate you know we've overused glyphosate we overused things  
**[0:34:43-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:34:43):**  like penicillin we overuse things like amoxicillin and that we're not even let's not even talk about  antibiotic use of feed lots and superbugs there because that's like that's a whole lot of food  there because that's like that's a whole other can of worms that I don't really like getting into a  
**[0:34:59-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:34:59):**  whole lot sure but you know like have we have we messed up some of these systems so much that the  only way that they're going to continue is with synthetic inputs or that you know we just have  to keep inventing nastier nastier herbicides nastier antibiotics to keep dealing with the  
**[0:35:21-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:35:21):**  superbugs that are evolving in nature because we're trying to kill them with ever more toxic  chemicals it's like I feel like it's a never if I feel like it's a cycle that's just building on  itself and building on its excuse me building on itself and we're heading to a point where  
**[0:35:40-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:35:40):**  we're going to have weeds and bacteria and and other environmental pathogens that have evolved  super resistances to all the chemicals that we've developed to try to get rid of them  it's a biological arms race right as we as to put it another way exactly what you're saying  
**[0:35:59-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:35:59):**  is we as we develop new tools nature finds a way around them and so we need to as we continue that  and I'm not saying that we should stop looking for better better pesticides or antibiotics or  things like that I'm not saying we should stop either but we also in my opinion need to look at  
**[0:36:19-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:36:19):**  alternatives are there ways that we can reduce these inputs and you know and I I I'm a crops guy  yeah and so going back to going back to weed control can we leverage cover crops to reduce the  the herbicides that we need to to introduce can we can we look at you know there's some some  
**[0:36:40-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:36:40):**  you know there's some some interesting interesting ideas that that your podcast actually introduced  me to anyway in the context of fungus farming you know in the you know the episode you did with  Jay Young about the bioreactor are there ways that we can rebuild the soil using using some  
**[0:37:00-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:37:00):**  some fungus and reduce the amount of synthetic fertilizer that we that we have to use to produce  our crops you know and so you know I think that there are alternatives in addition to finding  bigger and better tools I think we can always keep an eye out for for other ways to accomplish  
**[0:37:19-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:37:19):**  the same goal yeah yeah for sure yeah the and you brought up fungus I think it's  fungi are are like key to the ecosystem and I think fungi are one of the least understood parts  of our natural world like we understand so little about fungi and how they actually work and work  
**[0:37:45-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:37:45):**  yeah fungi healing they're getting up at eight o'clock grabbing their lunch blocks and going out  yeah no like the biological processes that happen inside of fungi and how fungi you know metabolizes  the things around it to feed itself like we don't know like my my dad always liked to say  
**[0:38:07-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:38:07):**  the what we at 90 of what we think we know might be 10 correct those ratios might be a little bit  off and when I was 20 I didn't get it when I was 30 I didn't really get it now that I'm in my 40s  I get it I get it because it it seems like every time we turn around we're learning that that's  
**[0:38:33-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:38:33):**  something that we thought was true maybe it isn't quite true or maybe it doesn't quite work like  that and I'm also kind of thinking of the Pareto principle have you ever heard of that one that's  the 80-20 rule isn't it the 80-20 well the 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of  
**[0:38:52-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:38:52):**  your effort and man if I take a step back from my operation and you know whether we're talking  about the cattle the grass or even my work on the podcast like that 80-20 rule it holds up in almost  every case are you saying that 80 percent of your podcast episodes that your guests are  
**[0:39:14-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:39:14):**  not as good as the top 20 that's not what I'm saying at all  that's not what I'm saying well as somebody who's going to probably post up in that in that 80  percent I will say that that there are there are definitely and it just as an aside breaking  
**[0:39:29-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:39:29):**  breaking the fourth wall or whatever I couldn't be happier with with the the success that you  found with this it's it's very very educational for me there's a lot that I have learned about it  especially since since because your focus is generally on cow calf stuff and that's  
**[0:39:44-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:39:44):**  since because your focus is generally on cow calf stuff and that is not in my wheelhouse and I have  some usually have some some stocker cattle that we run around here but I am I have yet to jump  off the deep end into actually owning owning cows I'm learning a lot from it and I and I can't thank  
**[0:40:03-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:40:03):**  you enough for the service that you're doing well thanks I I appreciate I appreciate that and  I really enjoy doing it and now there's times where it's where it seems like a lot more of a job  but it does it has taught me a lot of valuable skills valuable skills and it forces me to practice  
**[0:40:23-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:40:23):**  skills and stay on a schedule and right you know it's not like I record every Wednesday right you  know some week this week we're doing I'm doing three I'm recording three I did one yesterday  doing this one today and doing another one tomorrow next week I've got two scheduled the  
**[0:40:39-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:40:39):**  week after that they're probably not going to be one but I still got to maintain a release schedule  so you know trying to figure out you know when I need to be gone when I need to take time or  okay I can pound out I can pound out six episodes in the next two weeks and then I can coast at one  
**[0:40:54-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:40:54):**  a week for a while if I have anything come up and you know anything come up in the schedule  trip I want to take I've got time it's taken a little bit to get there I'm not always where I  want to be I'll say that it's been it's been quite a while since I've been caught without an episode  
**[0:41:12-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:41:12):**  yeah it was probably it was probably back down in the 40s the last time I got the last time I  made it to Friday and realized I didn't have an episode for Monday and that's that's an interesting  that that that grind I I know that grind I as an aside I started my I I have a podcast history  
**[0:41:34-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:41:34):**  myself and and did my first one in 2008 is when I recorded my first one I had I used to be in the  auction industry I mean I am in the auction industry I used to do a lot of a lot of writing  a lot of blogging and along with my my auctioneer tech blog I started a podcast that ran from 2008  
**[0:41:52-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:41:52):**  for for a few years and I originally had planned on an every week you know episode release and that  that quickly became something that was untenable for me and so it really became a you know whenever  I want to and whenever I have a good an interesting guest or there's something I want to say I would  
**[0:42:07-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:42:07):**  release an episode and obviously that is not the way to success in the podcast world especially  now that it has become such a competitive thing there wasn't that many back in the  if you would have stuck with it in 2008 like Joe Rogan has like 12 million yeah I mean and  
**[0:42:27-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:42:27):**  you know I think I might have had a hundred downloads once that's that's fair but it was  also very niche right it was it was you know technology for the auction industry and so  you know those overlapping Venn diagrams that's a that's not a lot of people but I had fun doing  
**[0:42:43-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:42:43):**  it and it and it it was something that was fun to try I did I don't know 50 episodes there and then  took what I learned and started doing some podcast work for for purple wave my employer and did you  know another 50 there until you know some things that had changed and that that was no longer  
**[0:42:59-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:42:59):**  useful for our goals but it was it was definitely fun and it taught me a lot about recording and  editing and doing all of those things and my point is that I am very impressed that you are  able to stick with it and do the the weekly release and and get them out on time well well thanks  
**[0:43:16-0:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:43:16):**  get them out on time I missed that's funny because the one that just came out this week which would  be a couple of the first episode of 2023 I normally try to release have the release scheduled  at 4 a.m central time you know and I try to get that you know get everything edited down  
**[0:43:36-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:43:36):**  show notes written have everything done Friday so I don't have to worry about all the weekend I can  just you know have everything uploaded have everything scheduled and everything done I did  the editing I didn't schedule it I uploaded it and I did not write show notes so Monday morning  
**[0:43:56-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:43:56):**  I get up and I'm like all right let's go do our thing you know go do morning or dinner or  dinner or dinner on the office maybe sometimes I'm a little bit obsessed but I'd like to go  down Monday mornings when I get up and check and see how many downloads I've had since since we  
**[0:44:16-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:44:16):**  went live I try to check again around noon and then I check again before I go to bed and that's  that's my release day statistics and I I don't write it down I don't have a chart anywhere but  I don't write it down. I don't have a chart anywhere, but I keep it in my head.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:44:30):**  Right? So I like, by the time I get up, it's this number by noon,  it's this number. And by bedtime, it's this number. Okay.  And if we're within a few percent, it's a good episode. If it's really high,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:44:44):**  okay. Maybe we got something going on.  Maybe we ought to go take a look and see who else is sharing us.  So I get up and I'm just, you know, kind of poking around.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:44:53):**  I'll admit I got up at like eight 45 Monday morning,  nine o'clock. I make it down to the office and it hit refresh on my computer  draft. Oh shit. So I open it up. I'm like, Oh crap.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:45:09):**  I never wrote show notes. So I'm down there at like nine,  I'm down there at nine o'clock Monday morning,  five hours after I should have released an episode, typing up show notes,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:45:18):**  got it up in just a few minutes. And, um, of course by noon, my Monday,  my Monday crowd is already, you know,  sending in messages on a discord server or send me text messages. Like, yeah,  
**[0:45:28-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:45:28):**  great episode this week. I'm like, Oh, well, okay.  I didn't think it was that good, but I'm glad you did.  So it's sometimes it's surprising to me. Um,  
**[0:45:40-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:45:40):**  you know, some of the content, like, you know,  we're our own worst critic, you know, as content, as content creators.  Um, and I can imagine, like, I never did any music because I could probably,  
**[0:45:52-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:45:52):**  never stand to listen to myself and how bad that I'd play or how bad I'd sing.  That's probably why I never got into it.  But there there's,  
**[0:46:01-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:01):**  there's some content that I put out that I'm just kind of like, ah,  I'm not real excited about it.  And when it gets well received by the community and my fans,  
**[0:46:11-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:11):**  that makes me feel really good. But at the same time, it's kind of like,  why did I think that was crap? And everybody loves it.  No, that's it. It's and it's all in my head, right? It's,  
**[0:46:24-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:24):**  it's all in my head and it's just some of these hang up, just a,  I guess just my own personal hang up. I need to get over like, you know,  this is good. People appreciate this.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:35):**  And even though sometimes it made me might make me a little uncomfortable,  maybe sometimes it's, it's extra work cause it is. Um,  it's worth doing, it's worth doing to hear things like, you know,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:45):**  like you saying that you're, you know, you're trying some stuff. Um,  I'm going to, I'm going to challenge you. You said that, you know,  I'm primarily focused on cow calf. Okay. I get that.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:46:55):**  Cause that's a lot of my paradigm, you know, grass fed, pasture, finish,  cow calf, direct to consumer. But I'd like to think that,  that I'm trying to provide different perspectives from across the industry  
**[0:47:09-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:09):**  about, about problems that we're having solutions that we're finding and,  and niches that people are in. Like, uh, the,  the last episode we did for 20, 22 with, uh,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:19):**  my friend Tyler Dolly from, uh, California. Did you listen to that one?  I did.  50,000 chickens a year, pastured chickens,  
**[0:47:28-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:28):**  50,000 pastured chickens a year. And we barely talked about cows. So,  and you want to talk about a niche like, okay,  pasture chickens and, and, uh,  
**[0:47:40-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:40):**  we were talking about eggs earlier.  I don't even know what chicken costs in a grocery store anymore.  Cause we don't buy it there. Like, you know,  
**[0:47:47-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:47):**  when we've got like 30 some birds out running around the yard and we've got,  you know, three freezers down in the basement, but full of cow and chicken.  Well, mostly cow.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:47:59):**  Oh, that's a fun,  A lot of chickens to fill a freezer. I think. Yes. Yes, it does. And you know,  50,000 chickens seems like a lot. It really does.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:48:09):**  But when we get down to pounds, that's only a couple of truckloads,  like how much,  how much land areas it takes to raise 50,000 chickens.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:48:19):**  Not as much as it takes to raise 50,000 cows and 50,000  chickens will convert. No. Okay.  Let's back up. So like on the scale of conversion, you know,  
**[0:48:31-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:48:31):**  from pounds of food to pounds of meat, you know,  pounds of intake to pounds of meat on an animal chickens  can convert it two to one. Right. And you know,  
**[0:48:43-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:48:43):**  and turkeys are in there, ducks are in there and you know,  they're like that two to three to one. And then like you get up to, uh,  to pigs, pigs, sheep, goats,  
**[0:48:52-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:48:52):**  they're kind of in that three and a half, four to one kind of area.  And then all the way at the far end is cows.  And it takes seven. It takes over seven pounds to put a pound on a cow.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:49:05):**  And, and, you know, we're talking kind of like best case scenario.  So it doesn't, it takes a lot less area to raise chickens.  Well, why aren't chickens more popular? Well, because it's a small unit.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:49:20):**  It's not a lot of production. And every,  every animal requires a certain amount of labor.  So it comes down to how many pounds of protein can one human manage to  
**[0:49:30-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:49:30):**  produce from livestock.  And it seems like for the labor investment,  you get more pounds of beef per per labor unit investment.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:49:41):**  Like that's what it's, that's what it seems to me.  Then we run into a problem of labor because we both know labor is our biggest  cost in this business. Like,  
**[0:49:51-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:49:51):**  you know, you and I, we can afford not pay ourselves a whole lot in order to make  bills or in order to make a machine payment or order to, you know, buy parts.  Okay. You know, we can not take that for a while and say, okay, well,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:50:05):**  after we sell calves or, you know, after I get the wheat haul to the elevator,  you know, then we'll go ahead and I'll take that back pay. Right.  We can do that. If you have somebody working for you and doesn't work,  
**[0:50:16-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:50:16):**  like, you know,  they kind of want to get paid really regularly all the time.  Yeah. Well, don't you think that, that, I mean, that's why we see such, such,  
**[0:50:28-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:50:28):**  uh, vertical integration. If I use,  if I'm using the term correctly in,  in swine and poultry because every animal takes, you know, more touches.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:50:37):**  And so by confining them and, and, you know,  operating those numbers at scale is the,  best way to minimize labor costs. Right. And so the pasture raised chicken is,  
**[0:50:48-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:50:48):**  is way outside the error bars of standard industry practice, obviously.  And so, uh, in order to market that,  they're going to have to capture a lot more from the market to justify that high  
**[0:51:00-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:51:00):**  labor cost of putting chickens on pasture. Whereas, you know,  with, with beef, we don't see that so much because like you say, you can,  you can run a lot more labor on that.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:51:10):**  So much because like you say, you can, you can run a lot more pounds of beef with,  with a much smaller labor cost as compared to the other, the other animals.  I mean, am I right? Yeah. I think that's right. And you know,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:51:27):**  we're back to this, you know, labor economics of food.  I seem to end up here a lot for some reason about labor economics of food and  you know, okay. So let's, let's, let's stay on this chicken example. Okay.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:51:41):**  So we can raise a bunch of chickens in a pasture for not a lot of labor,  or we have a chicken barn. Now we got to get them processed.  And all modern processing plants,  
**[0:51:54-0:52:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:51:54):**  whether we're talking about beef, chicken or pork,  they're basically set up to run a specific size of animal  line within a fairly narrow range. You know, that that's why, you know,  
**[0:52:06-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:06):**  that's why some,  that's why some cattle that weigh 1800 pounds get a discount and some of the  way 1800 pounds get a premium.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:16):**  It could be out of the same pen of catalyst. Just where's that plant?  Where is it going to a plant that set up for 1800 pounders?  Or is it going to a plant that set up for 1400 pound cattle?  
**[0:52:25-0:52:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:25):**  Cause if they're going to a plant that set up for a smaller carcass,  that bigger one's going to take a lot longer to process.  It's going to take more manpower. It's going to slow down their chain speed.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:35):**  If you send that big,  if you send that small animal to a plant that processes bigger stuff,  it's going to be the inverse problem and they lose efficiency.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:43):**  So they want to keep those, those, those very,  very narrow processing size windows.  And again, it's efficiency and it comes down to labor.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:52:55):**  It's the labor to process and produce the food.  And you know, we work for ourselves.  We set our own pay rate. We set when we get paid, which, you know,  
**[0:53:08-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:53:08):**  a lot of people would argue, we both work for insane people.  I won't contradict that because I know that I work for a complete lunatic.  Like, I, I don't know why anybody would want to work for me. I mean, I'm,  
**[0:53:21-0:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:53:21):**  I'm crazy. But as we,  as you get into these processing plants  and we have to concentrate this quote semi-skilled or unskilled labor,  
**[0:53:36-0:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:53:36):**  because we need to make that job as simple as possible because there's so many,  so much of it.  Like if you have 6,000 head of cattle going past you on a line every day,  
**[0:53:46-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:53:46):**  what do you have time to do? Make one cut, make one simple observation.  One simple observation before the next one's in front of you. Okay.  I get it. We gotta be efficient. We gotta feed the world.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:00):**  But when we take the, these,  these line workers in a meat plant and we've been paying them  $15 an hour. Okay. And I'm not saying that that's,  
**[0:54:12-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:12):**  that's necessarily inadequate or inadequate wage.  That's just the number we're paying them $15 an hour. Okay. Well,  now with the era, you know, the post COVID era,  
**[0:54:25-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:25):**  okay. In the last two years,  we've seen more societal change than in our  entire life today. Like you got to admit that in two years,  
**[0:54:37-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:37):**  so many things have changed.  People are becoming aware about their food systems and labor has gone up a  lot. I mean, at the start of COVID you had, I mean,  
**[0:54:47-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:47):**  minimum wage was like 10 bucks and people were going, Oh, we need 15,  we need 15. And within just a few months that, Oh, we need 25,  we need $25 an hour. And  
**[0:54:58-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:54:58):**  the whole essential non-essential worker bit, you know,  who's really essential in the world. The people that grow the food,  the people that transport the food and the people that sell the food, I'm sorry,  
**[0:55:12-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:55:12):**  your job at Walmart selling TVs during the pandemic,  you are not essential. Like it showed us what,  well, it didn't, it didn't show us. It should have showed us what,  
**[0:55:26-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:55:26):**  what matters in society and what kind of skills and what kind of people matter  in society. You know, the people that maintain the power plants that, you know,  the, the public works guys that maintain the water,  
**[0:55:37-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:55:37):**  the county guys that go out and grade the roads, like none of our shit changed,  like nothing changed for me during COVID.  I am still, I'm still cranky that all of, you know,  
**[0:55:47-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:55:47):**  musician friends and everybody got so much time during lockdown that they got to  write music and play songs.  And there I got to go back out to the tractor again,  
**[0:55:54-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:55:54):**  because there was just nothing changed for us.  It just never ends. Right.  But then we get into these, these big meat plants and you know,  
**[0:56:05-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:05):**  not even talking about, you know,  the chickens or the pigs that had to be euthanized and the,  in their confinement barns, horrible, horrible situation.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:15):**  But every step in this, in the, in a meat plant,  now these workers are wanting a little bit more of a wage. Okay,  fine. We got to pay people a fair wage. I get that. I get that.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:26):**  If that's what society wants, we got to pay people a fair wage.  Now we're running into things like the price of chicken is going up.  The price of beef is going up in the grocery store. Eggs,  
**[0:56:38-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:38):**  we talked about eggs earlier,  like eggs or eggs in a grocery store are kind of difficult to find.  And when they do find them, they're expensive. And, um, uh,  
**[0:56:48-0:56:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:48):**  this is probably on last week's episode a little bit too, but so it's,  it's a lag time. Right. And we looked it up before the show and it was what,  three, four months ago that it was in the news about avian flu and they had to  
**[0:56:59-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:56:59):**  call another end of November. So a little over a month ago. Yeah.  50 million chickens, I think is what it said.  Chickens and turkeys. So then that, that creates a lag,  
**[0:57:11-0:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:57:11):**  right? So now here we are like 45 days later and we're starting to see, oh,  there's egg shortage. There's egg shortage.  And I know I talked about this in the episode with Tyler about  
**[0:57:23-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:57:23):**  hatcheries and egg hatcheries. Like,  okay, Tyler, you do 50,000 pastured birds a year. Where do you get your eggs?  Well, they're all Cornish cross eggs and like,  
**[0:57:35-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:57:35):**  there's just a few commercial hatcheries in the country. Okay.  Well what if one of them has a problem? Like,  this is the problem with like a lot of concentration and centralization.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:57:46):**  Okay. We've got millions of chickens and thousands of chicken barns  and you know, hundreds of pastured chicken and operations.  But if they all bottleneck to basically two commercial hatcheries that  
**[0:57:58-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:57:58):**  everybody's getting their eggs from,  one of those has a problem and even drops a few percent of production that has  supply chain ripples for two years across that whole industry segment.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:58:10):**  It's a big lever. It's a huge lever.  And  it's a huge lever. It is a huge lever.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:58:20):**  And I think that there's so many things like that, like, you know,  the centralization of,  of egg production centralization of, you know,  
**[0:58:30-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:58:30):**  meat processing. We saw with the Tyson fire, like, okay,  that's not even 10% of the weekly kill,  but you shut that one plant down and that affects everybody in the country's  
**[0:58:44-0:58:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:58:44):**  meat prices. Like guys, we've, we've got to,  we got to make some changes here.  And I think that we're at a cost of about $2 million a year.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:58:54):**  And I think that we're at a critical time. You know,  we're at one of those historical inflection points where we're either going to  keep driving down this path of centralization and  
**[0:59:06-0:59:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:59:06):**  monopolization and having ultra big corporations concentrate  things because of economies of scale.  And that's going to continue, or we're going to say, no,  
**[0:59:20-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:59:20):**  we need to maybe hold this level and  start diversifying and start spreading this risk out.  Right. So how do you, how do you do that without, without getting into politics,  
**[0:59:34-0:59:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:59:34):**  which is, which is probably not where we want to go. How do you in, in a,  in a free market society,  get there without some kind of government intervention saying, you know,  
**[0:59:44-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:59:44):**  you know, yes, we, you know,  we know you're a corporation and we know you have to return value to shareholders.  And we know that the best way for you to do that is to get bigger and to do all  
**[0:59:53-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=0:59:53):**  of these things and the mergers and the acquisitions and the whatever.  How do you, how do you say no, how do you hold that,  that, that, that diversity in the, in the production marketplace?  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:00:08):**  I don't know, but I mean, it,  as long as there's some government intervention,  there's government intervention period.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:00:14):**  And I would make the argument that  that government doesn't necessarily create,  doesn't necessarily put a limit on the largest  
**[1:00:30-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:00:30):**  on the, on the biggest, right?  They don't limit the upper end of the size spectrum.  But what government does is government will create a barrier to entry or a  
**[1:00:40-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:00:40):**  minimum economic size.  That's viable. Does that make sense?  You're saying that that's what happens now or what they should do?  
**[1:00:50-1:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:00:50):**  Well, what happens now is, you know,  there's a minimum economic size,  but with anything that the government comes in. Okay.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:01):**  Let's take your situation here and let's just like strip down to the basics.  Okay. Wheat farmer on dry land. Okay. Okay. You get crop insurance, right?  Yes. Okay. Back by the government. Yes.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:12):**  Okay. Can you, can you grow anything you want down here? Theoretically?  You can, but could you grow tobacco here?  Unlikely.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:23):**  Okay. Well, maybe the plant won't physically grow.  But what I think you're getting at is that only certain types of crops are  eligible for, for the subsidized crop insurance in this area.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:34):**  Yes. Right. And even if there were more crops,  there has to be a market for them. Right. Okay. So yeah. Okay.  Theoretically you could grow tobacco here. Like just theoretically. Sure.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:46):**  If you want to grow tobacco here, you grow tobacco here.  Where are you going to sell it? Right. Okay. You want to grow barley here?  Yeah. Sharon co-op probably buy that. What,  
**[1:01:54-1:02:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:01:54):**  what's something that grows here that nobody will buy?  Well, and, and, you know, it's not even will nobody buy it,  but is the nearest place that there is a market for it close enough to make it  
**[1:02:05-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:05):**  justifiable. For example, I did some, you know, running some math on, uh,  Sesame,  which is something that they grow a fair amount of down around Hazleton and,  
**[1:02:13-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:13):**  and Kiowa, you know, they, they grow Sesame.  For the listeners, that's only about 20 miles.  Yeah. 20 miles South, just right along the, right along the Oklahoma border.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:21):**  It is not an uncommon crop to find down there. Uh, I was doing some numbers.  And then I think at least at the time I was running the numbers,  the closest place I could take it was like Alva or something like that,  
**[1:02:31-1:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:31):**  which for the listeners is, is roughly an hour from here.  An hour and a half with my trucks. Uh,  and so that was just not something I wanted to, wanted to have to deal with.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:40):**  And so we are limited in, you know,  and there are plenty of producers around here who, uh, you know,  self-insurer who don't need the crop insurance or whatever. I have some,  
**[1:02:49-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:49):**  some reasons that I, I need to ensure the things that I,  that I put out as much as possible, but,  but certainly plenty of people don't, don't, uh, don't leverage crop insurance,  
**[1:02:58-1:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:02:58):**  but then it becomes exactly, it's a question of markets and, you know,  what I can grow is limited to somebody that'll take it in driving distance.  And the driving distance. And that's the big thing, right?  
**[1:03:12-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:03:12):**  Like, you know, uh, 20 years ago,  or even when you got started farming 10 years ago,  that driving distance was a lot less of an issue with two to $50 diesel fuel.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:03:24):**  Now with four and a half dollar diesel fuel,  that driving distance has got to shrink because it's not like you're getting  more money for your crops. Well, I mean,  
**[1:03:34-1:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:03:34):**  that proportionally, proportionally speaking like  energy is the most expensive it's ever been in relationship to food and labor.  Like energy is the most expensive it's ever been, but it's still way too,  
**[1:03:52-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:03:52):**  it's still way too cheap. Oh, I, I absolutely agree with that. Um, yeah.  But I mean, when I started farming,  I sold a lot of wheat at three and a half, four dollars, you know, back in the,  
**[1:04:01-1:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:01):**  you know, not 2012, but in the, you know, a couple of years later, we, you know,  at two and a half dollar diesel. And now we're looking at, you know, I don't,  I didn't look at the board this morning, but you know,  
**[1:04:09-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:09):**  we're around $8 wheat right now. And so, you know, it's double and it, and it,  and it fluctuates a lot of times together. A lot of times it, it diverges,  but it's not quite as disparate as your,  
**[1:04:20-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:20):**  as you're making it out to be as far as the proportions.  Well, okay. I guess a different way to kind of look at it is  how long do the ripple effects of high of high energy costs and high  
**[1:04:33-1:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:33):**  grain commodity prices? How long do those take?  To enter into the, the global supply, you know, the, the food chain large.  And to show up on the grocery store shelf. So, I mean, I mean,  
**[1:04:43-1:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:43):**  there's a big difference in what the loaf of bread costs that's made with $8  a week versus three and a half.  A week right. Should be.  
**[1:04:53-1:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:04:53):**  There should be.  And I don't think that there necessarily is. And this goes back to the same,  the same people that take, take value in the, in the supply chain, you know,  
**[1:05:04-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:04):**  on the, the grains and the commodity side is take value out of the supply chain.  I know that, that the, uh, the Packers is, is frequently, uh,  a foe for you and, and probably would be for me if I knew more about it,  
**[1:05:16-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:16):**  but I know that there's a lot of,  a lot of stress and strife in the, in the cattle producers for the, the,  the dog, the part of the dollar in the supply chain that is taken by the Packers  
**[1:05:24-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:24):**  before it shows up on store shelves.  Nabisco and Mondelez and these other, you know,  multinational mega food corporations. They're doing the same thing to you,  
**[1:05:33-1:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:33):**  that the big four Packers you're doing to me,  they're doing all the value add work,  telling you that you're growing a premium product,  
**[1:05:42-1:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:42):**  paying you pennies for it. And they're capturing all the premium and markets.  That's 100% what they're doing.  It's good opportunity to say this. And I don't think I've said this out loud,  
**[1:05:57-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:05:57):**  at least not on the podcast. So the Packers,  they pay hamburger price for the,  for our steak quality cattle. Okay.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:07):**  Then they take our state quality cow and export an awful lot of them. Whatever,  whatever is qualified to export.  They want to export it because that's where they're going to get the highest  
**[1:06:16-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:16):**  premium. They're going to maybe take some of those leftovers trim,  but fat trim,  throw it in the grinder to blend in with animals that they're bringing in from  
**[1:06:27-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:27):**  overseas in a lot of cases in the last couple of years,  we're talking about Brazil and Mexico and Mexico.  In a lot of cases in the last couple of years, we're talking about Brazil,  
**[1:06:37-1:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:37):**  Nigeria,  places that don't necessarily have the best human rights record,  the best environmental record. Okay. We're bringing in meat from them,  
**[1:06:47-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:47):**  throw it in a grinder,  mixing it with our good fat and selling this product of USA. Of course,  it's all legal. Everything's on up and up above board because it says USDA on it.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:06:57):**  But here's the point like down in Brazil or Nigeria, you know,  you, you think those herders in Nigeria are getting a fair wage compared to what  I'm getting  
**[1:07:09-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:07:09):**  like an importing that beef that's produced so far below my cost of  production because Nigerians don't have to pay taxes.  They don't have to pay $4 diesel fuel, right? They don't have to pay, you know,  
**[1:07:22-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:07:22):**  increasing land taxes because our County can't balance a damn budget.  They don't have to pay that. They don't worry about any of that stuff.  They live on like three bucks a day and that's great for them.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:07:33):**  I can't exist on those kinds of wages,  but the Packers seem to think that that's okay to do is to import meat below  the cost of production because we've got to feed the world.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:07:43):**  We've got to feed the world. And you even said that  let's be honest, small farms,  small diversified farms feed 70 to 80% of the  
**[1:07:56-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:07:56):**  world, not big commodity operations.  Like I drove past to get here,  like this isn't feeding the world. What we're doing here,  
**[1:08:07-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:08:07):**  I don't think necessarily qualifies as feeding the world.  Why do we want to worry about feeding the world?  We can't even feed a community to Sharon have a grocery store anymore.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:08:19):**  No, I know. I know that's come and gone in the last 15 years.  Sure. And, and you know, small town grocery stores are kind of  probably losing battle now that dollar general and family dollar exist in the  
**[1:08:33-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:08:33):**  world and are in the food business.  Probably never see a grocery store in Sharon, Kansas again,  unless it says dollar general on the front.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:08:40):**  Which is also unlikely given the local population.  I don't know. There's a post office here. There's a post office here,  which means it'll probably be a dollar general before too long. But yeah,  
**[1:08:52-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:08:52):**  I get what you're saying. Um,  you know, and, and it's externalized cost in the food system.  You know, we have a tendency to externalize all of our costs and  
**[1:09:08-1:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:09:08):**  some of it's in the name of progress. Some of it's in the name,  some of us in the name of feed the world.  Some of it's just because this is how we, this is what we got to do to survive.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:09:17):**  And you know,  we wouldn't,  the American consumer wouldn't have to feel guilty about rainforest  
**[1:09:28-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:09:28):**  destruction in Brazil for animal agriculture.  If they ate pastured grass fed beef,  like we wouldn't have to worry about that. Like that wouldn't be an issue.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:09:39):**  If the American consumer changed how they wanted to eat,  but instead of addressing the issue, okay, I realize,  I'll probably get some hate mail for this, but now let's just say Brazil,  
**[1:09:51-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:09:51):**  they're cutting down Amazon rainforest to grow corn, to feed the cows.  It happens. It happens people. Okay. And that that's,  that's what comes to mind when I hear them say slash and burn and the burn of  
**[1:10:05-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:10:05):**  the rain forest for, for cows. Okay. They're not doing what I'm doing.  They're not clearing a forest and turning it into pasture land and responsibly  grazing cattle by moving them and, you know, restricting access.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:10:18):**  They're clearing the forest, they're clearing the forest to plant corn,  haul the cows that are standing in a feedlot that are probably going to get  exported here anyway. So,  
**[1:10:31-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:10:31):**  you know, a lot of the problem,  a lot of the things that people are upset about with the environment can be  solved from the bottom up with the  
**[1:10:43-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:10:43):**  change in how people spend their food dollar,  but the education to get them to understand on,  on the difference those food dollars make like we just,  
**[1:10:54-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:10:54):**  we have to unpack years and years and years of  consolidation and  consolidation and, and government policy.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:11:07):**  So if, if in a market-based economy,  it's the consolidation that makes food cheap,  and we are expecting consumers to fix that by changing your buying habits.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:11:18):**  Hold up. I don't agree that food should be cheap.  I don't either. I'm saying that it is  because of corporatist consolidation in the food supply chain.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:11:32):**  And we want consumers to spend more money on food that is arguably better for  them, or at least better for the environment. How do we do that again,  without government intervention,  
**[1:11:44-1:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:11:44):**  when all the consumer wants to do is go to the grocery store and spend the least  amount of money possible when times are tough and they have families to feed?  How do we do that?  
**[1:11:55-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:11:55):**  Gosh, I don't know. I,  I really don't know. And  I think that's a question I've been trying to answer for, I don't know,  
**[1:12:08-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:12:08):**  what is this probably 90, 90 ish plus episodes plus bonuses.  That's always been the question on my mind is,  is how,  
**[1:12:20-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:12:20):**  how do we get people to understand the cost of food?  Not the cost of food, not just the cost,  not just what it's costing you out of your wallet,  
**[1:12:31-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:12:31):**  but what is the environmental cost? What is the social cost? You know,  what are the longterm environmental costs of this food that is here because of  this production practice? Like it,  
**[1:12:45-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:12:45):**  it's absolutely maddening to me to see the prices  and some of the quote food that comes out of a place like dollar general or  family dollar. Like if you listen to Calacrate episodes or you,  
**[1:12:59-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:12:59):**  you, you talk to Mike Calacrate,  he likes to say that dollar general and family dollar are the vultures that show  up to pick the last bit of wealth out of rural America.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:13:09):**  Like they show up to mine the last bit of wealth out of our communities and  they sell the truck wrecks.  Like they sell the Walmart and Amazon truck wrecks and the rejects from Amazon  
**[1:13:20-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:13:20):**  and Walmart.  And you know,  I remember when we got our dollar general in medicine lodge, people like, Oh,  
**[1:13:28-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:13:28):**  it's great. We got, we're going to have a dollar general.  It's going to be all these good jobs for the community. Wait a minute.  You're going to tell me that that six minimum wage jobs  
**[1:13:40-1:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:13:40):**  are good for the community.  Like, well, and what are we selling in there?  Nothing you can't get anywhere else at heart with higher quality that'll last  
**[1:13:50-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:13:50):**  longer for higher price. Okay. Well, that's the problem.  People need cheap stuff. People want cheap stuff, cheap stuff than last.  I mean, my work jeans. It was a few years ago.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:03):**  I went to buy these nice Duluth work pants, heavy work pants.  I also switched to the, the fire hose flex. Oh, they're the best pants.  Aren't they so great. And they don't wear out. You know,  
**[1:14:13-1:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:13):**  I used to go down to the farm store and buy those key jeans for like 20,  25 bucks. They're good jeans.  They last a year, maybe a year and a half. It's Duluth jeans.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:25):**  Yeah. They're four times the price. I have some that are eight years old,  but I still wear.  So the cost conscious price  
**[1:14:35-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:35):**  shopping American consumer, like,  I think we get told a bunch of lies, you know,  you know, we can take five bucks. Okay.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:47):**  We can take 50 bucks and we can go buy $50 of food at dollar general,  go buy packaged crap in boxes with huge  nutrition labels,  
**[1:14:58-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:14:58):**  or we could drive down to Kiowa to the locker and buy $50 worth of meat.  What's going to be more sustainable. What what's,  what's going to sustain us for longer. What's going to keep.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:15:09):**  What's going to keep how many days is that $50 of ultra processed  crap at dollar general going to get us versus the $50 of me.  Now I get that's like, we're comparing apples to potatoes,  
**[1:15:22-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:15:22):**  but I'm getting down. Like I want to talk about nutrient density. Okay.  Now you're a wheat farmer.  I remember when I was a little kid,  
**[1:15:33-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:15:33):**  when my mom would send me to school and like kindergarten,  first, second grade, I had whole wheat sandwiches with thick slice,  turkey, and cheese that she cut off of a block. If I was lucky,  
**[1:15:48-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:15:48):**  maybe I'd get mayonnaise out of a jar. Okay.  That was my lunch. That was my school lunch and an apple. Okay.  No potato chips because they didn't exist in our house.  
**[1:15:58-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:15:58):**  Like I can't even remember how old I was when I first had potato chips,  but I remember that they were awesome.  So I show up at school and I've got my Turkey and cheese sandwich on whole wheat  
**[1:16:10-1:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:16:10):**  bread. And this is a whole wheat bread from now. Like this is like early eighties,  whole wheat bread. When it was like, it was real. It was really cardboard back then.  Yeah. I mean, it had some texture,  
**[1:16:23-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:16:23):**  like a piece of straw every once in a while, some chaff.  Anyway, I remember coming home one day and asking my mom,  why we couldn't have white bread, like all the rest of the kids.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:16:38):**  Because it was so much better. Man. I'm like, I go, you go from eating a Turkey sandwich like that.  And somebody wants to trade you like a couple bites of a peanut butter and  jelly sandwich on white bread. You want, that's like, man, it was good. Sure.  
**[1:16:53-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:16:53):**  Sure. Candy bread. Exactly.  So I go home and ask mom, so mom, why do we have to eat this whole wheat bread?  Why can't we have white bread? And she explained it to me. She said, well,  
**[1:17:08-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:17:08):**  to make that white flour, they have to take the germ off the wheat. And the germ is where all  the good stuff is. That's where all the vitamins and minerals are. Roger that. Understood. Then I  remember seeing enriched flour now fortified with 13 vitamins and minerals. I remember that when  
**[1:17:30-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:17:30):**  that came out and now you can't find anything without enriched flour in it. Like all flour is  enriched. So, and here's what I'm getting at. Okay. So we take the wheat that you grow. Okay.  We're going to send it to the plant and we're going to mill the germ off of it.  
**[1:17:51-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:17:51):**  Okay. Because the germs where all the nutrients are, but it doesn't mill well. It creates some  texture problems and it makes the flour a little bit darker. So let's get rid of that because we  can always go get other vitamins and minerals and put them back in. Right. Has anybody ever  
**[1:18:08-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:18:08):**  stopped to ask where the hell the vitamins and minerals they enrich our food with come from?  Do you have any idea? I don't. I don't either.  And that's the miracle of food science. Right?  
**[1:18:26-1:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:18:26):**  Do we really know what's in our food? What's in enriched wheat flour? What do they put  in wheat flour to enrich it? And where do they get that from?  I'm sure those are questions that we could find the answer to with a little searching or a couple  
**[1:18:40-1:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:18:40):**  of phone calls. And so I guess I don't necessarily get wound up about that. I'm not saying you're  wrong by any means, but that particular question isn't exactly something that keeps me up at night.  I'm not saying it keeps me up at night either. Trust me, there's a lot other weird shit that  
**[1:19:00-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:19:00):**  I think about that keeps me up at night. This isn't one of them. AI taking over the world.  Yeah, maybe we could circle back to that one. Then the question I have is, okay,  so where did all this stuff come from that we're using? Where do we get the vitamins and minerals  
**[1:19:20-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:19:20):**  to enrich the wheat flour? Where do those come from? Well, I don't know exactly,  but my logical brain tells me that that's got to be some kind of industrial property.  Industrial process. That involves pumps and pipes and vats and big stainless steel,  
**[1:19:35-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:19:35):**  stainless steel everywhere and computers and guys in lab coats going around. Because it's not like  we can take a coffee bean and pull vitamin A out of it. I don't know how to do that. I don't think  you know how to do that. Chemistry and efficiencies and things like that.  
**[1:19:51-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:19:51):**  But then where does it come from? How do we get it? This is something that they just pull out of  thin air. I'm sure somebody will write in and tell me, well, it's pretty simple. They just get it from  all the corn. Okay, maybe that's one source. I get that ADM, Arch of Daniels Menland,  
**[1:20:10-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:20:10):**  their business isn't selling corn. Their business is selling all the shit that they make from the  corn. They buy the corn and they take everything out of it that they can. They try to make plastics  out of it. They try to make fuel out of it, whatever. I get it. I get it. But then I start  
**[1:20:28-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:20:28):**  to wonder like, okay, if we don't know where the vitamins and minerals come from that they're  putting back in our food, how do we know they're bioavailable? I say that because I've seen this  with cattle about bioavailability of minerals. I used to use just bagged mineral from the local  
**[1:20:47-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:20:47):**  mill that I won't mention. You know what I'm talking about. Just a bagged mineral.  Mineral is mineral, right? Well, I don't think all minerals are the same. I think there's a big,  big difference in bioavailability. So, I switched to C90, which I talk about on the podcast.  
**[1:21:08-1:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:21:08):**  Kansas Independent Salt, another great product. Redmond's Real Salt, very, very similar. Okay.  And Steve Campbell will back me up on this, that these ancient sequestered sources of salt,  excuse me, that these ancient sequestered sources of salt have the minerals and the correct minerals  
**[1:21:29-1:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:21:29):**  and the correct bioavailable ratios. Okay. And that's something that I need to learn more of,  you know, as a side jag. You know, the whole Himalayan sea salt thing, there are humans who  are thinking that this is somehow better than anything else or some kind of a health food.  
**[1:21:50-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:21:50):**  And we know that at least in humans, the studies that I have seen, anything that's rigorous and  meta-analyses and those kinds of things say that for human, salt is salt and that there's no  increase in benefit from Himalayan sea salt over regular salt. And in fact, there are certainly  
**[1:22:08-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:22:08):**  some impurities and some toxins in there, though. I question whether that's useful because the dose  makes the poison like we've talked about before. Right. And if the, if the  Dihydrogen monoxide is poisonous. If whatever's in the Himalayan sea salt isn't good enough to  
**[1:22:24-1:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:22:24):**  help you, then whatever's in the Himalayan sea salt is probably not good enough to hurt you  either. And so it's really just expensive salt that you're buying for humans. And so I, that,  that is something that I have heard on your podcast about sea salt for animals that I need  
**[1:22:36-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:22:36):**  to go back in, put a pin in and go find some, some studies on. I almost wish I would have brought  some, brought a little, little, like little glass of C90, just loose salt. I can tell you, like,  we threw Morton salt away. Like it's, it's not even in our house anymore. Cause like the salt  
**[1:22:56-1:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:22:56):**  that you go to the grocery store and buy, you know, the Morton or the whatever in the, in the  in the container that's iodized. Well, that's pure salt. That's just straight up sodium chloride.  They take, you know, a natural seat, natural, natural salt. They evaporate it out and they  
**[1:23:12-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:23:12):**  separate it out and they mill it to where they have just sodium chloride. Cause they don't want  any impurities. God, we can't have any impurities. Well, what if it's the impurities that make it  worthwhile? So, and there's, there's definitely a difference in tastes between quote table  
**[1:23:30-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:23:30):**  salt that you'll find at a restaurant and the C90 that we have at home. They're I guess, technically  Baja gold is, is what's on the bag, but it all comes out of the same plant.  Is it bright white? No. Does it have uniform crystal size? No, but it tastes different.  
**[1:23:49-1:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:23:49):**  How does it taste different? Well, it's still salty as hell, but I guess it's not as sharp.  And, and what does that mean? Well, I don't know, but I know that at almost every day for about the  last week since I've had had a sore throat, I've been gargling salt water and drinking a little  
**[1:24:08-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:24:08):**  bit of it. And I'm not talking like just put a little bit of salt in water. I'm talking like  I filled up the cup with salt and then I put water in it and more of a paste to it. Yeah. And  it doesn't seem to bother me. It doesn't seem to bother me at all. I don't feel dehydrated.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:24:24):**  In fact, when I do feel dehydrated, I'll go take a little sip of salt and then about a glass of  water. And that makes me feel better than an entire bottle of water. I mean, when I say bottle,  like, you know, big 24 ounce bottle, I'm not talking, I don't drink plastic bottles because  
**[1:24:40-1:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:24:40):**  micro plastics, but you get what I'm saying. I think there's, there's something to bioavailability  of minerals and to tie this back in. So if we're going to go buy mineral for our cows,  get to go buy a bag mineral product, whether we're going to go buy it at the farm store or go buy it  
**[1:24:59-1:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:24:59):**  at the feed mill. Okay. Yeah. Their nutritionist says it's got everything that the cows need.  Where's it come from? I mean, if it's not bioavailable, then it's going to bypass  through the animal and it's going to come out in the manure pack. And if it's, if it's still  
**[1:25:17-1:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:25:17):**  not bioavailable after it goes through the animal, it's not bioavailable in the environment to  microbes, to fungi or to plants. So that that's, that's kind of where I get to. And that, and that  also kind of ties back into some of the things that Jay Young says are some of the things that,  
**[1:25:38-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:25:38):**  you know, we're that a lot of farmers that I, you know, hear and see on social media talking about,  like doing the soil samples, like do a soil sample and see if you really need to be putting on those  units of N or P or K. Absolutely. And bioavailability exists certainly within fertilizer  
**[1:26:00-1:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:26:00):**  as well. Not just, not just, you know, nutrients into an animal, but, you know, is the nitrogen in  the soil available to the plant, right? Or, or whatever, whatever nutrient is in context. So  you're absolutely right about bioavailability. I just question the importance of the source.  
**[1:26:18-1:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:26:18):**  You know, you're, you're looking at the end result, you know, is it bioavailable? Are these  things there? In my mind, who cares where it comes from? If the answer to the question, is it  available? Are these nutrients here for whatever organized organism we were trying to nourish?  
**[1:26:33-1:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:26:33):**  You know, if, if the answers are, are satisfied in those questions, I don't care where it comes from.  Whether it comes from a plant in Hutchinson or whether it comes from an ancient ocean,  doesn't matter to me. I mean, and, and I can see that point. And I guess kind of like the larger  
**[1:26:50-1:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:26:50):**  part of it is maybe some of these origin sources that we're using from to get, you know, vitamins,  minerals, whatever, maybe they're not as bioavailable as another source.  That's maybe more expensive. I, that's what I'm getting at is I think that,  
**[1:27:11-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:27:11):**  I think that chasing profit has, has pushed people to use some of these things that, you know, maybe  are less bioavailable just because it's available from it, you know, because it's cheaper and it's  not bioavailable. So the benefit that they're saying that it's giving us, it's not 100% there.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:27:32):**  It may not be. Here's another question to circle back to call back to a previous part of this  conversation is all of these enriched flower nutrients that they put back in the bread.  What if those are more bioavailable than what was in the germ that got taken out?  
**[1:27:48-1:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:27:48):**  I don't know the answer to that. And it's probably the, the answer is probably no,  but isn't that a question that maybe we ought to be thinking about is maybe it is more available.  Maybe these nutrients are of a higher quality than what was taken out. It's possible.  
**[1:28:01-1:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:28:01):**  It's possible. I would agree that it's possible.  I will stipulate it might be unlikely, but that's a question that we would,  if we're going to throw a flag and say, Hey, you guys are doing bad things to our wheat flour.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:28:14):**  Maybe that's something we ought to ask first.  Like 100%, 100%. And I think, you know, it's very useful to try to ask that question from  both sides or from both ends and try to attack, you know, see, see if there is a problem from  
**[1:28:27-1:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:28:27):**  both ends. And so now we get to, now we get to why don't we know the stuff that we don't know?  Okay. Why don't we know the stuff we don't know? Well, where,  where do we learn all the things that we know about farming and ranching and about plants?  
**[1:28:44-1:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:28:44):**  Where do we get that knowledge from university? Some, some of it's institutional knowledge from,  you know, our ancestors and you know, the, the knowledge that's been passed down.  Some of it comes from, from data research trials. Some of it comes from charlatans who come out and  
**[1:29:03-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:29:03):**  say, Hey, you guys should be doing this because I say so. And because so-and-so next door has  had success with it. Okay. Data and research trials.  That's the one that I find particularly useful. Okay. Well, let's explore that a little bit.  
**[1:29:17-1:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:29:17):**  So if you have a company that funds a study at a university, say to control a weed,  and that study comes out and they test five different substances against that weed  and the results that they put up clearly show  
**[1:29:36-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:29:36):**  that another company's product is more effective at control of that weed, but yet they recommend  a product from the company that sponsored the study. I actually like, this is a specific thing,  and this is like, okay, old world bluestem. So old world bluestem, it's a, it's an engineered  
**[1:29:56-1:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:29:56):**  warm season grass. And older bluestem refers to a general family of grasses that were developed  in the fifties and sixties down in Texas. One of them is called King Ranch Spar. I am sure that the  King Ranch had absolutely nothing to do with the breeding and development and importation of this  
**[1:30:15-1:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:30:15):**  grass at all. Then there's WW Spar, there's Caucasian, there's yellow, there's, there's  several different varieties. The two that we have here, primarily yellow bluestem and Caucasian  bluestem. Neither one of them are great. I have, I figured out how to deal with it though, and we  
**[1:30:34-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:30:34):**  can circle back to that if we have more time. So this was probably four, five, six years ago,  we went up to Greensburg, our community center to watch this presentation on old bluestem.  And the folks came down from K-State and they put on a great presentation. It had all kinds  
**[1:30:51-1:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:30:51):**  of slides and the whole day was sponsored by Dow who makes Roundup, right? So all throughout all  the, did I have that right? Bear, Bear is Monsanto now. Monsanto went away. Bear is the,  okay. It was the, I distinctly remembered that it was, it was sponsored by the people that did  
**[1:31:13-1:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:31:13):**  glyphosate. Okay. Okay. Because that's what they're recommending is they're recommending glyphosate,  glyphosate, glyphosate, glyphosate. And I still had the presentation somewhere.  And I can tell you for a fact that Arsenal worked better in all their studies. Like that's what  
**[1:31:30-1:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:31:30):**  their, that's what their slides were showing. Like you can't tell me that when you're showing  91% year one control and 94% year two and 96% on year three for Arsenal versus Roundup,  versus Roundup, which is down in the seventies for control, you're not going to sit there and  
**[1:31:48-1:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:31:48):**  tell me that you're going to recommend Roundup when I can read the chart for myself. And it said  the Arsenal was better and used less chemical. And even the, even one of the slides said it was  like a more cost-effective treatment. Well, that's what I was going to say is the only way that that  
**[1:32:02-1:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:32:02):**  recommendation might make sense is if the value proposition there, if, if, if glyphosate is,  is substantially cheaper than Arsenal, and I don't know what the dollars are, but that's the only  way that you can make the case that glyphosate is a better choice is if it's, if it's more  
**[1:32:14-1:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:32:14):**  cost-effective. It didn't seem to be okay. And, and from application experience, it didn't seem  to be either. And I can tell you, you know, since we're talking about it, guys, if you have old  world blue stem and you go spray it, you can nuke it to bear dirt for three years and it'll still be  
**[1:32:32-1:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:32:32):**  there. Ask me how I know, because I've done it. I've tried. I've watched cattle walk by it and not  eat it. Then again, I've got a group of cattle on the ranch now that know how to use it. And  in September, when it was, when it was good and palatable, a couple of paddocks that I had them  
**[1:32:52-1:33:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:32:52):**  in while it was, while it was really attractive for them to eat, man, they ate it to dirt.  I was going to say, there are people around here who buy it and plant it.  There are, there are, there are, I know of at least, at least two people who, who drill it and,  
**[1:33:09-1:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:33:09):**  and actively cultivate it because their cattle like it so much. I wish they would not do that.  I know that. And I know that NRCS doesn't want them to do that either. I know it's,  I think it's listed as a noxious weed. Yeah. That happened in the last, in the last couple of years,  
**[1:33:22-1:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:33:22):**  it got listed as a noxious weed. I don't think you can, I mean, you're not supposed to, to import  any into the county. You're not supposed to import the seed into the county. You're not supposed to  plant it. Not supposed to, I mean, there is a long list of shit I'm not supposed to do that I  
**[1:33:37-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:33:37):**  probably do every day. Sure. Sure. You know, and we could, we could, we can name names after we're  done with the podcast and, and, and talking in more specifics. But I, I, I find it interesting  that that, that particular cultivar is, is so widely hated by a large group of people and so  
**[1:33:53-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:33:53):**  widely loved by, you know, an admittedly smaller group of people, but they swear by it saying that  it is much more hardy than the, the big air quotes, native grasses that are, you know, would normally  be growing around here. Well, it is more hardy. I mean, I 100%, it's more, it's, it's a more resilient  
**[1:34:10-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:34:10):**  grass, like drought. It doesn't even care about drought. Like it doesn't care if it's wet. It  doesn't, they don't care if it gets overgrazed. I mean, it's going to the old world blue stems  that I've got experience with. They kind of succeed no matter what. Okay. Succeed.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:34:27):**  What's the definition of that. They increase their volume in the pasture, but that's not the  right metric. Okay. I have a grass ranch. I'm trying to make a living selling pasture finished  cattle direct pasture finished beef, direct to consumer. And from everything that I've seen her  
**[1:34:48-1:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:34:48):**  in red, it's not as good of a grass. It doesn't have the protein, the fat, the nutrient balance  in it that my native, my native plants do. So I'm in a situation where, because I want to stay  all natural, you know, the programs that I'm in and like, I know I've been saying, I've been on  
**[1:35:11-1:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:35:11):**  I'm the quote, the programs I'm in for a while on the podcast that I haven't been able to talk about  them guys. We're so close. I'm so close to actually getting some of these certifications. I've been  working on for a while. I'm so close to being able to talk about them. Like it's, it's been a process.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:35:28):**  But in order to qualify or, you know, qualify for some of these programs. Okay. Like I can't go out  and mass treat areas with herbicide. Can't do it. Have I done it in the past? Yes. Yes, I have. I  have sprayed brush. We've tried to spread old world blue stem to death and I've watched it not work,  
**[1:35:46-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:35:46):**  which is why I don't do it anymore. And, um, like the, the sumac that I used to go spray,  you just think that was a problem and you just want to go spray it. Well, now it's not a problem  because in the winter time I get a lot of cool season grass that grows up underneath there.  
**[1:36:03-1:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:36:03):**  And my bighorn cattle, they go into those, they go into those sumac thickets, looking for that  cool season grass and those Forbes that grow this time of year and they tear up and they thin out  those sumac grows. So when we come back and graze them next year during the growing season,  
**[1:36:18-1:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:36:18):**  there'll be more grass under it because the cattle have been through there in the dormant season and  open up the canopy cover. They've gone in and tilted up with their hooves. They fertilized it  with their manure and their urine. It's like, okay, that's not that big of a deal. Old world  
**[1:36:32-1:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:36:32):**  blue stem. We're still working on how to get rid of that or how to make that, you know, stop taking  over areas. I tried over grazing it. I put a hundred thousand pounds per acre of stock density  on it for a day. And you want to talk about like something looks a little gruesome. You put a  
**[1:36:52-1:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:36:52):**  hundred thousand pounds of stock density on anything out here for a day and see what you're  left with. It'll be dirt. That's fine. You just got to make sure it has plenty of rest and recovery  and rainfall before you come back and graze it again. So I'm trying to work on biological  
**[1:37:10-1:37:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:37:10):**  controls and the less that I have in my mind to rely on, on a jug, on a chemical,  the longer it takes to get results. But the happier I am with those results.  Does that make sense? Sure. Like I think that there's like soil health, soil health and fire  
**[1:37:34-1:37:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:37:34):**  are two things you can't go to the farm store and buy a box of. And there are two things that take  a long time to pay off. There are two things that take a long time to see benefits of in a  management change. If you want to see something fast, go buy a jug. If you want to see something  
**[1:37:50-1:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:37:50):**  slow, maybe, maybe don't go buy that jug. I think that's fair. You know, and it goes back to what I  was saying earlier about, you know, the arms race and can we look for, for better, better solutions.  And here, I'm going to talk about my skepticism again, and something that I frequently hear in  
**[1:38:14-1:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:38:14):**  this community of regenerative ag and all of that is, can we look for better solutions?  That is the appeal to nature fallacy. One of the fallacies is the naturalistic fallacy, wherein we  say that because it is natural, it is better, which is relatively logically inconsistent.  
**[1:38:34-1:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:38:34):**  It may be that that's the case, but it isn't a reason in and of itself.  And maybe the nature we're observing is a manipulated system. And it has been  manipulated or interfered with to the point that it no longer represents what it once did.  
**[1:38:54-1:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:38:54):**  Does that make sense? It certainly does. It certainly does. And we obviously change nature  over time. But my point, I guess, is that just because it's the way that it always was before  it was untouched by man, isn't necessarily the best and most efficient system. Although a lot  
**[1:39:13-1:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:39:13):**  of times they do line up. That's not a reason in and of itself. And so a lot of the speakers in  certainly soil health and Ray Archuleta, I think, is one of the guys. And I absolutely love a lot of  the things he says, but he falls back on that because that's the way nature did it. And so we  
**[1:39:31-1:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:39:31):**  have to go back to that. And that's not logically consistent in my mind. That's not a reason in and  of itself. I'm not saying that everything he says isn't right as far as what he advocates,  but the reasoning that that naturalistic fallacy almost becomes religious sometimes in nature,  
**[1:39:48-1:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:39:48):**  that because that's the way that nature did it. It's just not a reason, a useful reason for me  to want to change something. If that makes sense. Yeah, I get that. And I love Uncle Ray. That guy  has so much energy. Oh, goodness. Yes. And have you been to a conference where he's speaking?  
**[1:40:10-1:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:40:10):**  I have not. I have just seen videos. Well, be prepared to do calisthenics.  I think I heard that. I think somebody was talking about that, that he makes you stand up.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I mean, you get a couple of hundred people that are used to being  
**[1:40:27-1:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:40:27):**  active all day out, you know, walking fences or walking back and forth to shop and you  put them in a conference room all day. Yeah. When Ray says, all right, everybody get up,  put your arms over your head and do jumping jacks. You get some funny looks, but I'm going to be one  
**[1:40:42-1:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:40:42):**  of those people that's probably leading that exercise because I know that I need it, you know,  a little bit of, you know, getting the blood moving kind of helps the brain function. But Ray,  yeah, the manipulation of our environment and what is natural, what is real. You know,  
**[1:41:02-1:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:41:02):**  several years ago, folks were talking about, okay, yeah, the bison we'll just, you know,  we'll just take out all the fences and bison will fix the problems. I don't think so. And so here's  a thought that I've been working on for a while that I don't think I've said, I don't think I've  
**[1:41:19-1:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:41:19):**  articulated all this on the podcast. Okay. So y'all have heard me talk about beavers,  that if we turn the clock back to 1750, that there were like 600 million beavers on the  North American continent. Like I can kind of see what that might've looked like on my ranch.  
**[1:41:38-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:41:38):**  Like I can see where the historical beaver dams would have been and you know,  roughly how much water there is like trying to apply that to, to an area of much off the ranch  is just beyond my mental capacity. I wonder if I could make chat GPT, right, man, algorithm to show  
**[1:41:57-1:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:41:57):**  what he'll put a pin in that one. Okay. So we came out and we trapped all the beaver out of the  Plains. Well, they create a lot of ponds and a lot of rivers. How much did that restrict the movement  of the bison? How much did extirpating the beaver? What effect did that have on the bison population?  
**[1:42:25-1:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:42:25):**  Okay. Now let's get even wilder than this. Okay. So we'll turn the clock back to 1491  pre European contact. And like, I haven't actually read this book, but there's enough evidence out  there that between 1500 and 1600, that there was a mass depopulation of this continent  
**[1:42:50-1:43:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:42:50):**  because of European disease running through the native population. Okay. It's starting to  be supported more and more with archeology. You know, that big city they found over by Arc City,  Arc, Kansas City, like 15,000, a city of 15,000 native Americans living on the banks of the  
**[1:43:07-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:43:07):**  Arkansas river. Like when we were kids in school, that wasn't taught. The people here were nomadic.  There were no towns. I mean, they taste the Buffalo up and down the Plains. Okay, fine.  So we're finding that there were, you know, big civilizations and we're understanding that there  
**[1:43:26-1:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:43:26):**  were these big, huge, complex, advanced civilizations in North America before 95 to  98% of them died within the span of a hundred years. Now we haven't been through it, but I can  guarantee you that if 95% of your people die in less than a hundred years, your civilization collapses,  
**[1:43:51-1:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:43:51):**  you lose all of your institutional knowledge. Like everything is done. Like you're down to  scattered bands that are just trying to rove around and make a living, which is what we started to find  when the Europeans came back in the late 1600s and 1700s. A pretty much an empty continent.  
**[1:44:10-1:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:44:10):**  Okay. So we found an empty continent. It's full of beaver people in your point of beaver hats.  So we get rid of them. And now we've got all this open land out in the West  that people want to come out and settle in just right where we are. What was it full of?  
**[1:44:33-1:44:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:44:33):**  Comanche Indians and bison. We had to get rid of the Comanche Indians before we could settle this  area. I mean, we're, we're like right on the Eastern edge, probably the Northern end of the  Comanche area, where they exerted their influence. And a great book about that is Empire of the  
**[1:44:54-1:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:44:54):**  Summer Moon. Have you heard about that one? Great audio book. Joe Rogan talks about it. I talk about  it. It's a great book and it could give you some insight into some of the history of this area and  what things are like. And mostly it has to do with like the around the line of Estacado and  
**[1:45:11-1:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:45:11):**  down in Texas, Texas Panhandle. And mostly it talks about, it's also the story of Cynthia Ann  Parker, which is one of the last white women that were abducted by the Comanches. And she went and  lived with the Comanches and I think she got rescued and it's a good book. So I think about  
**[1:45:32-1:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:45:32):**  like gross effects on the ecosystem. Okay. So when European disease depopulated the American continent  95, 98% of the people, okay. Even if it's half the people, it doesn't matter. The point is  you depopulate that many people and the things that they're using for their food source no  
**[1:45:53-1:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:45:53):**  longer have that pressure on them instantly. So here's something kind of wild to think about.  Okay. What if in 1550, what if bison were in decline and then all the native Americans that  were over harvesting bison started to die off. So then the bison population rebounds. A couple  
**[1:46:18-1:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:46:18):**  of hundred years later, more white people come through and they take out all the beaver,  which drains all the beaver ponds, drains all the rivers, which were probably very likely  quite a few of them barriers to navigation for bison. Ah, what do you mean ponds or barriers to  
**[1:46:41-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:46:41):**  navigation for bison? I imagine the Medicine River from the Salt Flats all the way to Belvedere  being a quarter mile wide. Do you think that was a barrier to navigation for bison?  You would think so. 100%. So then we get up into the 1870s.  
**[1:47:00-1:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:47:00):**  1873. We've got General Sherman, Civil War veteran. Sherman's marched through the South,  burned the South. He knew how to win a war. Yeah, he did. He knew how to screw up a civilian  population. I have a, my sister for Christmas got me a t-shirt with General Sherman on the front and  
**[1:47:21-1:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:47:21):**  says, I'm the reason country music is so sad. There is one of my favorite sub-redits that is  Sherman posting where they idolize him. And while I will support anyone who was that aggressive  against the Confederacy, he did some pretty rough things to the Native Americans. And so he has a  
**[1:47:38-1:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:47:38):**  very mixed history. Well, I mean, he was smart. He knew he couldn't beat the Comanches in a straight  up fight. He knew he'd get his ass kicked. I mean, let's face it, a guerrilla warfare out here in  these hills. Yeah. I wouldn't want to fight that battle either. Yeah. And he knew the way to get  
**[1:47:54-1:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:47:54):**  rid of them was to get rid of their food supply. So that's why we kill all the bison. So I guess  to wrap all this up and put a bow on it, did Sherman do the bison a favor by ordering their  extermination because the bison through the last 400 years of human influence on the continent  
**[1:48:15-1:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:48:15):**  where the bison overpopulated and heading for a population crash because of there wasn't any,  because a lack of hunting pressure on them, lack of any predators, lack of any predators.  Interesting theory. Sure. And we'll never have any idea from anywhere close or not,  
**[1:48:33-1:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:48:33):**  which I think that's fine. It's fun to think about though. That is.  It really is. And I guess that circles back and, you know, we, we can kind of go ahead and wrap  up that circles back to an earlier point that I made like 90% of what we think we know might be  
**[1:48:51-1:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:48:51):**  10% correct. Can I chase you down another rabbit trail here before we wrap up? Oh yeah. Yeah.  One question here. Yeah. Since I seem to be good at getting you, getting you to talk here.  Yeah. We're going to have to do more of these because like, I, I usually don't talk a whole  
**[1:49:12-1:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:49:12):**  lot. Yes. And I, and I'm, I like to, I like, like I told you when you first asked me if we could  record this, I said, well, I'm really, really used to being the one asking the questions and,  and just listening. And so I have, I have learned a lot and enjoyed our conversation, but  
**[1:49:26-1:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:49:26):**  I'd love to hear your thoughts. And this is something that I think about quite frequently  in the context of me and my cattle operation, such as it is, and looking at expanding into  a cow calf eventually and things like that. But as far as the the long-term sustainability of  
**[1:49:44-1:50:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:49:44):**  the cattle industry writ large in the context of meat alternatives, and  you know, I will, I will stipulate to pretty much everything that that has been said on your  podcast and within the industry about you know, not not being nutritionally equivalent  
**[1:50:03-1:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:50:03):**  at the moment, and maybe not having the taste right at the moment and being expensive at the  moment. My question for you is this all of those things are at the moment and don't you think our  fancy Dan food scientists are going to be able to figure those three things out. And at some point  
**[1:50:24-1:50:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:50:24):**  in the next decade, isn't it possible that a consumer will be able to go to a store  and purchase something that is nutritionally equivalent and is that does have the taste and  the mouthfeel and all of the experience of beef and or meat or whatever they are trying to  
**[1:50:43-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:50:43):**  approximate. And this is the important one because of that consumer pressure on the, you know, the  lowest cost food. Once the meat alternatives are 80% of the equivalent, then the meat  product is 80% of the equivalent natural meat product. How does the the the animal agriculture  
**[1:51:07-1:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:51:07):**  industries, how do they survive through that?  Oh, okay. So there's a bunch of there's a bunch in there to unpack. Right. Okay. Am I worried  about Baker synthetic meat long term? From where I stand right now? No. And so let's break this  
**[1:51:27-1:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:51:27):**  into two kinds of synthetic meat. You have the lab grown tissue, okay, which is like it's actual beef,  right? It's beef cells grown in a lab. Yes. Okay. And then you have the plant-based,  you know, impossible imitation, impossible foods that you don't have soy, like hemoglobin that  
**[1:51:46-1:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:51:46):**  make it look like it's bleeding. Okay. So let's take a look at each one of those. So first off,  let's take the impossible foods, the plant burgers. Okay. So they're going to make these  with what soy protein isolate and a bunch of other stuff. Okay. A lot of soybean products,  
**[1:52:02-1:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:52:02):**  a lot of plant products. How are we going to grow those? Okay. So we need to get,  and I have a point here. So we need to grow a bunch of these soybeans, special soybeans to make  special plant burgers. Okay. Or maybe they're just run of the mill, damned old soybeans that  
**[1:52:18-1:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:52:18):**  everybody around here grows. It doesn't matter. Right. We're still talking about a monoculture  likely with the soil destroying practice likely with herbicides, pesticides, fungicides in order  to get that crop to grow to maximize yield. Right. Then we're going to take those soybeans,  
**[1:52:38-1:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:52:38):**  transport them to a plant, use another energy intensive process for first order extraction.  And there's another couple of those processes, right? It's not like they just take the  soybeans, grind them up. And you know, now we have a plant burger. We got to take the soybeans.  
**[1:52:51-1:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:52:51):**  I've got to go through a couple of industrial processes, probably some kind of reactor,  a bunch of chemicals, process, process, process, process to finally, we get to a Patty. Okay.  Okay. Let me, let me, let me take one right here, right while we're on it,  
**[1:53:06-1:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:53:06):**  don't lose your train of thought, but you're, you're assuming that we are requiring additional  plant commodity grains to, to do this. Not necessarily additional. It just requires some  of them to be. If beef specifically is a seven to one feed to gain. Okay. I see where you're going.  
**[1:53:25-1:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:53:25):**  What if we substitute what we're feeding cattle and take all of those grains that we're putting  into livestock production and use some of those in these other processes is, are we still seven  to one inefficient in the production of these and mind you we're on the same team. It's going to  
**[1:53:43-1:53:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:53:43):**  take, it's going to take more of an analysis. Sure. Sure. I'm just saying that, that, that,  that saying that these are, these are bad grains that come from bad sources. We're already making  grains that come from these sources and feeding them to livestock. If we feed them directly to  
**[1:53:57-1:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:53:57):**  humans, doesn't that increase some efficiencies there? Efficiency where? Because it comes down  it comes down to the energy balance. Everything at the end of the day, it's got to come down to  the energy balance, calories in calories, out calories, consumed calories produced. Okay.  
**[1:54:15-1:54:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:54:15):**  I don't have the math. I am not smart enough to come up with the math to be able to tell you I  consume X number of calories of energy of, of everything in my production process in order to  produce Y calories of beef. Sure. I can't do that. Okay. I know that industry-wide we burn 15  
**[1:54:40-1:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:54:40):**  calories to produce one. That's not sustainable. Okay. At the end of the day, it's the energy  balance argument in the meat, which is why I don't think fake meat will ever win. Will ever be more  than, than a small niche because the energy balance just isn't there. And so I said that  
**[1:55:05-1:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:55:05):**  I'm a pasture finished direct consumer guy. Right. Okay. My energy balance, my energy consumption  to put that pound of meat on my customer's table is fairly low compared to the energy required  for an animal that's lived in a steel corral on concrete, drank pumped water and had every bit of  
**[1:55:26-1:55:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:55:26):**  food hauled to it for two years. Oh, well, I didn't pay much for those DDGs. Yeah. Well,  you live next to an ethanol plant and you didn't pay much for those DDGs because the taxpayers  already paid for them twice. So the energy balance for fake meat, like the plant-based meat.  
**[1:55:49-1:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:55:49):**  Yeah. We can talk about conversion ratios, but let's talk about the energy required to raise  that cow from birth to slaughter and let's talk and how many pounds of meat that's going to yield  us. And then let's look at the energy required to make that many pounds of plant burger of  
**[1:56:11-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:56:11):**  impossible burger. Let's look at those energy requirements. Even if we go to the other end  of the extreme from my system and go to the feedlot system that I just described, where  that animals live a whole life, stand on concrete and steel pin, getting every, every bite of food  
**[1:56:24-1:56:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:56:24):**  it ever needs hauled to it. I think that beef still energy balances out better than the plant  burger. Now we can talk about the cultured meat burgers. Okay. That are real meat grown in a lab.  The dirty secret they don't like to tell you is they can only grow that in a lab  
**[1:56:45-1:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:56:45):**  by using a lot of what they call bovine growth serum. Okay. Where do we get bovine growth serum  from? Sure. We get bovine growth serum from cows that are carrying calves in utero when they go to  the slaughter plant. I bet every vegan and animal rights activist minds just exploded right now  
**[1:57:09-1:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:57:09):**  because they think that by eating these alternative meat burgers that they're saving cattle, that  they're giving them a better quality of life, that they're saving the environment. I'm sorry,  that's not the case because it takes an extreme quantity of those bovine growth serum to grow  
**[1:57:27-1:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:57:27):**  just a tiny little bit of meat. And it's a ridiculously expensive process. And this bovine  growth serum is in such high demand that I, okay, anecdotally, I heard of more than one plant paying  150 to $200 premium for bread cows to slaughter. Oh wow. So they could harvest the bovine growth  
**[1:57:52-1:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:57:52):**  serum and sell it to these fake meat companies. Normally it's a hundred dollar discount if you  send a bread killer cow in. Well, the guy that sent them in, you think he got that premium or  do you think he got the $200 premium or do you think he got the doc? I can tell you right now,  
**[1:58:14-1:58:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:58:14):**  he got the doc and somebody else pocketed that premium. So I guess for me, it's the energy  balance, Aaron. The energy just doesn't balance out and it's really hard from an energy balance  point of view to compete with a pastured finish system. So I am absolutely on board with your  
**[1:58:36-1:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:58:36):**  pastured finish system philosophy. I don't disagree at all. And that's the, not that I  learned it enough in any of this to have a crystal ball, but if I were to look in the future,  that's where I would see that the long-term persistent value in animal agriculture is being  
**[1:58:55-1:59:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:58:55):**  able to leverage some kind of economic return on pastures, places, especially out in the red hills  that you're not going to have cropping agriculture in most of the gi pills. If it was flat enough to  farm, they've already farmed it. Yeah, exactly. And they're still farming it. And so that's the  
**[1:59:15-1:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:59:15):**  only thing that I can say that, gosh, I hope there's going to be animal agriculture just so  that I have a way to gain some kind of financial return on my pastures, the places that I rent that  don't have the ability to be cropped. But as far as the, I sure think that there will be a time in  
**[1:59:36-1:59:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:59:36):**  the next while where you're right, there are energy balance challenges, but in the vegans  and the people who have a moral or an ethical challenge against animal agriculture are probably  going to opt for the imitation, the plant-based substitutes, which I can only predict will continue  
**[1:59:56-2:00:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=1:59:56):**  to improve and at some point will be close to indistinguishable and better on the nutrition side,  could be superior to beef in nutrition. And again, I come from a family of beef production here,  and it's certainly near and dear to my heart and I will continue to participate in it going  
**[2:00:22-2:00:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:00:22):**  forward as long as I possibly can. But that's the fear that I have, is that at some point soon,  the cost to the consumer, and that's really what we're talking about in a market-based economy that  we have and consumers going to the grocery store to buy groceries. You don't think that Dollar  
**[2:00:38-2:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:00:38):**  General is going to have cheap meat next to real meat that's going to be a lot cheaper, that  customers are going to turn them both on the, look at the nutritional labels that are going to be on  there and they're going to make a pocketbook-based decision to find something that's going to put  
**[2:00:54-2:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:00:54):**  the calories on the table where, gosh, maybe we'll have the real meat for Christmas and Thanksgiving  and that's going to be a treat. And if it's nutritionally superior, is it even a treat?  If it's just a nostalgia play for back in the days when we used to eat real meat, that's the part  
**[2:01:16-2:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:01:16):**  that scares me for animal agriculture going forward is at what point is that tipping point  where it becomes cheaper and more nutritious and more efficient to have the alternatives than it  does the actual meat? Again, I'll just fall back on my energy balance question.  
**[2:01:40-2:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:01:40):**  And you're talking about the all-in amount of energy to produce that meat product?  Yes. Like cradle to grave. And it's difficult to wrap your head around because I think that  I'm not going to claim to have a complete transparent understanding of it.  
**[2:02:06-2:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:02:06):**  And I don't think anybody does, but I can see problems with that energy balance.  We have very few things from nature that we can harness and we can do a lot to screw them up. We  get sun, we get rain, there's plants that grow. There's animals that eat those plants. And that's,  
**[2:02:30-2:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:02:30):**  I mean, it's almost free. If we take away our civilization structure,  okay, if we take away all of our bullshit economics and dollars and all that system,  and I guess to even some extent, we rethink what we think about private property and land rights  
**[2:02:51-2:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:02:51):**  ownership, right? Everything is free. Everything belongs to us all. And these resources are all  shared that we should somehow manage them together for the long-term, right? But that's a fallacy. I  mean, it's a well-documented the tragedy of the commons. At some point there has to be somebody  
**[2:03:09-2:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:03:09):**  saying, there are limits. These are the things that we're not going to do, or these are the things  that we're going to do in order to preserve this for the future. Because if humans were just left  to our own devices, I don't think you'd like the kind of world that we'd end up with in very,  
**[2:03:24-2:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:03:24):**  very short order. I mean, look at some of the third world countries and the pollution policies.  And I'm thinking of a place that I just watched a video on in Indonesia. Okay. It's an open air  garbage dump. It's a landfill. And it's like a six acre site. And just say, it's like a six  
**[2:03:45-2:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:03:45):**  acre site and they have a thousand dump trucks a day, bringing in garbage. And it's not like,  you know, we have here where we'll send out dozers and paddle scrapers to go dig a hole and put that  dirt somewhere else. Then we'll line it with clay and line it with a liner and start putting garbage  
**[2:04:02-2:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:04:02):**  in and compacting it. No, this was an old rice field. They leveled and start stacking garbage  on. And now there's a garbage mountain hundreds of feet high. They have to have a chain of  excavators. Like they dumped the garbage at basically ground level. And they have this chain  
**[2:04:18-2:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:04:18):**  of excavators that just bales the garbage all the way up to the top of the hill. Now here's the  really scary part. There are people in there on the garbage dump right there where the trucks dump  and their job is to sort through the garbage, to find the things that are recyclable, the plastics,  
**[2:04:40-2:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:04:40):**  they get the food out to feed their family. They pick bones out and sell the bones to  craftspeople that make bone crafts. Okay. We don't think of Indonesia as necessarily being  in the third world. We think of Indonesia as having big cities and glittering lights and  
**[2:04:58-2:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:04:58):**  civilization. Guys, the harsh reality is that is a very, very small portion of the world. And we're  very lucky in this country that almost all of us live above that standard. Oh, sure. When you've  got, you know, we externalize costs like that. You know, we externalize cost in our food system by  
**[2:05:25-2:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:05:25):**  taking, let me back up. Food's only cheap because labor's exploited.  I would generally agree with that. Yes. And if there's cheap food somewhere,  that means that there's exploited labor somewhere in the value chain.  
**[2:05:41-2:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:05:41):**  Or fiscal policy that exists to keep it cheap for political or other reasons.  Which, you know, it's still the same argument. Sure.  It's still the same argument. Or both of those things can also be true simultaneously.  
**[2:05:58-2:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:05:58):**  Yeah. Oh man. What are we, two hours in? Yeah. Now we're just having fun.  Now we're just getting rolling. But like I look at a beef plant. Okay. Because they're around  and we can drive through Dodge city, Garden City and drive out to liberal. Okay.  
**[2:06:16-2:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:06:16):**  What are those communities like? It's not a high standard of living.  You know, we've taken, we started off by talking about, you know, some of the history of Barbara  County and agriculture. You know, we used to have a meat plant here in Barbara County. We're  
**[2:06:30-2:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:06:30):**  getting one built again in Medicine Lodge. Did you know we're getting meat plant back in Medicine  Lodge? We have one in Barbara County. I mean, Kiowa locker exists. You mean in Medicine Lodge?  In Medicine Lodge. North Barbara County. Yes. I forget about Kiowa. Don't forget about Kiowa.  
**[2:06:47-2:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:06:47):**  Well, it's right next door to you. I'm in the other corner.  Kiowa is a long ways away from Sun City. I know. I know.  But okay. Yeah. So we do have a meat plant in the County. We're about ready to get our second one.  
**[2:06:59-2:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:06:59):**  And so what we did through the eighties, right after the beef check off, when every small town  in America, every town in Western Kansas used to have a meat plant. Coldwater had one into the late  nineties. I don't think protection had one. Mead has one again. Ashland used to have one.  
**[2:07:20-2:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:07:20):**  Greensburg used to have one. Okay. They all went away in the eighties. Why'd they go away?  Consolidation of the industry. Right. You had the big players come in and start buying up plants.  You had, you know, had IB. I'm not, I'm just going to shut up because Calicari will call me  
**[2:07:37-2:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:07:37):**  tomorrow and tell me everything I said was wrong. But you had a lot of consolidation in the beef  industry. So you had guys like, you know, that were running the plant in Medicine Lodge. He was  retirement age. Nobody's wanting to buy it. Nobody's coming up with those skills because all  
**[2:07:53-2:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:07:53):**  those skills we've, we took what should be somebody that's respected in the community.  That's a highly skilled worker, the butcher. We took that and replaced that  with a guy on a line with 6,000 animals going by a day. And he makes one cut. We took that.  
**[2:08:14-2:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:08:14):**  We took one high skilled job that was well-respected and we split it into four  minimum wage jobs. And we're calling that progress. I don't see it. I just don't see it.  You know, I think that if we want to make some real progress, we need to start talking about  
**[2:08:33-2:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:08:33):**  local food a lot more and we need to rebuild our local food economies. Okay. Is that going to  change the feed the world narrative? No, it's not. Is it going to be, I don't think we're ever in our  lifetimes. We're not going to see all the land between here and Medicine Lodge that's currently  
**[2:08:55-2:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:08:55):**  in commodity crops. We're not going to see that refenced off for livestock grazing. No. I mean,  we'll be lucky if 5% of the land between here and there eventually gets animals returned to it,  to return their fertility to it. We're not talking about a huge, huge, massive change in the  
**[2:09:16-2:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:09:16):**  industry. I think we're going to be seeing small incremental changes, but the small incremental  changes, they have to come from the bottom up. The thing that I wonder if we're paying close  enough attention to there's a book that I listened to in 2019. I know that you have some thoughts  
**[2:09:41-2:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:09:41):**  about pending economic collapses. I've heard that on previous issues of your podcast. I don't know  about the economies, but there's a book called Uninhabitable Earth, Life After Warming by David  Wallace-Wells. It really puts into stark colors the rate of climate change that I don't think  
**[2:10:03-2:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:10:03):**  anybody's paying attention to. You've mentioned Indonesia. I think Jakarta is on track to being  completely underwater by 2050. We're talking about- Yeah. That's not very far in the future.  No, it's not. That's the thing is that we're really looking at a world that our children  
**[2:10:23-2:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:10:23):**  are going to have some troubles living in. All that to say, and I don't want to go off on a big  climate change thing, but my point is that they think that there's an immigration challenges that  we have now. What happens when we're looking at hundreds of millions of people who are living in  
**[2:10:40-2:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:10:40):**  places that are underwater in 30 years, in 40 years? What does that do to our, what I consider  the luxury of being able to have good quality meat products that wherever they come from,  whether it's pastures or whether it's the feedlots or whatever, we have an ample supply  
**[2:10:59-2:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:10:59):**  right now. Generally, we're able to find meat on the racks, but what happens when we are trying to  feed people just meat basic calorie requirements and a lot of the crop production gets diverted  from feeding animals to feeding people. Will that happen and what does that do to the nature  
**[2:11:19-2:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:11:19):**  and complexion of these food supply chains? There's a lot that happens there.  You just can't help yourself from opening more every day.  I told you, I'm good at asking questions and trying to learn what I can about these answers.  
**[2:11:39-2:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:11:39):**  In the long run, I think in the long run there's going to be,  man, how do I say this? I don't know if I can say this without, I'll just say it. There's going to  be people that die. There's going to be people that die of starvation and famine in the near  
**[2:11:55-2:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:11:55):**  future. There are people dying of those things now in not insignificant numbers.  There's always been people dying of those things. It's not a problem that we don't grow enough food.  40% of food that we grow is wasted. Over 40% of what we grow is wasted and never gets eaten by  
**[2:12:15-2:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:12:15):**  a human or an animal, just rods. It's not a problem of production. It's not a problem  of production at all. It's a problem of distribution. So how do we distribute the  food to the people that need it? Well, do we take the food from where it is to the people that need  
**[2:12:32-2:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:12:32):**  it or retake the people from where they probably shouldn't be concentrated as much and move them  to where the food is, which seems to be a better solution. I think this plays into what we're  talking about with climate change and sea level rise. We humans are flawed and we've been talking  
**[2:12:51-2:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:12:51):**  about that off and on for the last couple of hours. We don't see a problem until it's right  in front of our faces and it's a catastrophe. We're blind to these things that like,  hey guys, if we don't change this in five years, something bad is going to happen.  
**[2:13:07-2:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:13:07):**  We're not going to change shit. We're going to wait five years until the bad thing happens.  And then we're just going to go, oh, that's bad. Let's figure out our way around this.  That's pretty short-sighted in my opinion, but scale is the problem. I can see something  
**[2:13:29-2:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:13:29):**  coming down the line in my business or on my land and I can make a change. I can make a change to  I can make a change to start to move the ship that is my business for my life. I can make that one or  two degree course correction early. So I end up where I need to be to avoid catastrophe or so the  
**[2:13:50-2:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:13:50):**  catastrophe is mitigated, whatever we as a society don't do that. Two people put together can't do  that. Right. Okay. And that's, that's is that it's a problem with the human condition or is it's,  I guess, indicative of the human condition and knowing that we are going to be short-sighted  
**[2:14:13-2:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:14:13):**  or not going to see these things that are we as a society that we're not going to see them  or, or have any cultural will to do anything about them until we are literally facing catastrophe.  Like, I think that's just a fact. That's a fact that's supported through history. So  
**[2:14:32-2:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:14:32):**  talking about sea level rise, if I said Graham Hancock, would you know who that is?  I would not. He is, he's a, he's a journalist that has an alternative theory about the ice age. Okay.  He says that basically around 12,000 years ago, there was this event called the Younger Dryas Impact  
**[2:14:57-2:15:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:14:57):**  and I'll probably get it wrong. But this event that happened around 12,000 years ago is  rapid sea level rise, three to 400 feet. Okay. Is what is what I've heard said.  I've also heard it more like 150 to 200 feet. Okay. Fine. Whatever. Here's the thing.  
**[2:15:17-2:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:15:17):**  It's really wild. They go to the Mediterranean and they find civilizations. They find evidence  of people, of cities, big, huge statues, stone structures. They're finding them in 150 feet of  water in the Mediterranean. They're finding them in Japan. They're finding them off Southeast Asia.  
**[2:15:41-2:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:15:41):**  Why are there, why are there buildings and stone statues under 150 feet of water pretty  consistently throughout the world? Huh? Maybe the sea level was 150, 200 feet, 400 feet, whatever  lower. But here's the point. At some point in our history, we experienced an extremely rapid  
**[2:15:58-2:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:15:58):**  sea level rise. We experienced a time of climate change. The human race did and we survived.  And just like we talked about with the native Americans, okay. We had a 95%  depopulation of the native Americans. Yeah. There were some of those people that were  
**[2:16:13-2:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:16:13):**  in the United States that had writing, that had paper. Most of them didn't. Most of their  history is oral. 12,000 years ago, we didn't, I mean, even if we had paper 12,000 years ago,  it probably got wiped out in the big floods when sea level rose 400 feet in a matter of,  
**[2:16:27-2:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:16:27):**  I don't know, 10 years. If sea level rise, I mean, we can talk about sea level rising  400 feet in 10 years. And that sounds horrific. Well, 40 feet in a year, that's a foot a month.  Would you notice a foot a month? It wouldn't be a problem. I mean, you might just notice, oh, hey,  
**[2:16:48-2:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:16:48):**  tide seems a little bit high today. Then a month later, it's like, huh, tide's even higher a month  after that. It's like, huh, why is my house wet? Then a month after that, it's like, huh, why is  there a foot of water in my house? Like you wouldn't really notice that. But to think about  
**[2:17:02-2:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:17:02):**  it in terms of a different timescale, when we talk about, when we put it in terms of 10 years or 100  years, 400 feet, yeah, that's a lot. But when you're living through it, it probably didn't seem  that bad. And that's not, and what we're going through now, the rate of change that we're going  
**[2:17:19-2:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:17:19):**  through now and the rate of change that's predicted for the next few years, like we  won't notice it. It'll be hard to notice. And we won't feel the pain until it's too much to bear.  I hope you're wrong. About the second half of that.  
**[2:17:35-2:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:17:35):**  I, you know, we're, we're, there was a stat I heard somewhere, I can't remember, but we're 20  years away from 20% of the world's population living where it's routinely, not, not just once  or twice, but averaging north of 120 degrees in the summer. And, you know, and- Five years ago,  
**[2:17:50-2:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:17:50):**  they said we, we have 60 harvests left. Now it's five years ago. So now it's 55 harvests.  That might be, that might be true. They say that every decade the natural wheat belt moves north,  150, 160 miles. What happens when we run out of north? Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's terrifying.  
**[2:18:11-2:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:18:11):**  And so while, while, while the, the, the economic collapse keeps you up at night, it's the,  it's the climate tipping point that keeps me up at night. And I respect that. So let's end with this.  Yes. The way to insulate yourself and your family from both of those risks and the economic risks  
**[2:18:30-2:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:18:30):**  and risks of climate change, shorten your supply lines and work on feeding, work on building a  local food culture, local, local food, local food culture, build a resilient local food system.  That's how we live through it. That's how more people survive. And that's, that's where I find  
**[2:18:51-2:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:18:51):**  hope is, is trying to spread the word that, yeah, there might be some problems coming down the line,  but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We can't stop them, but we can make it through.  And the way we're going to make it through is by relying on each other, small communities,  
**[2:19:12-2:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:19:12):**  and trying to feed ourselves and not worrying about feeding the world. Yeah. They're starving  pygmies in New Guinea. Fucking tragic. I don't care about feeding them when they're starving  people in our community, 10 miles away, let's feed them. Let's feed our people healthy food from here.  
**[2:19:37-2:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:19:37):**  Suddenly they're nodding your head. Yeah. Well, I agree. We take care of our own people first.  I think that we should be able to, to also help others, but we come from different political  places. Thank you. Thank you for the conversation. We need to do this again sometime where I have a  
**[2:19:59-2:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:19:59):**  better opportunity. I would love to interview you. 100% we're doing this again. Craft some, craft some,  some additional questions and make you think and get you talking. You do a really good job.  Thinking on your feet. I do an awful job at that. I'm a really slow thinker. I like to think I'm a  
**[2:20:14-2:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:20:14):**  good writer, but I'm an awful debater because I can't, I can't grab the things that I know out of  my memory fast enough. I had a TBI. I had a brain injury. Yeah. Just before peace treaty 2018.  Oh, wow. It's like a week before that. And  
**[2:20:33-2:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:20:33):**  ever since then, it's been a struggle. Like,  things, things aren't as quick. It's harder to hold onto a train of thought. Oh yeah. Names and  faces, man. Oh, wow. Oh, like my whole name, like there's a file cabinet in my head that links  
**[2:20:47-2:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:20:47):**  everybody's face to the name. I don't have access to that file cabinet anymore. I've had to rebuild  that from scratch. Like there's people that I have literally known my entire life that'll come up to  me and talk. And I won't know who they are until they tell me, because I just, I can't put the  
**[2:21:00-2:21:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:21:00):**  name with the face anymore. I don't know who they are. I don't know who they are. I don't know who  the face anymore. So there's, it's staying on a train of thought. I I've noticed I've caught  myself today a couple of times, like I'll be in the middle of talking and like shit. I knew what  
**[2:21:16-2:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:21:16):**  I was just, I just knew what I was going to say. I had all this planned out and I, and I, I, I it's  not there anymore. So, yeah, I, it's been, it's been interesting, you know, living with that,  living with the, living with the human brain and having it change on you, on how it works.  
**[2:21:35-2:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:21:35):**  It's such a weird thing the brain is and how memories are are  Flexible and change over time and and things like that  There's one of one of my favorite not to plug another podcast, but you talk about Rogan all the time  
**[2:21:48-2:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:21:48):**  One of my favorite podcasts is the the skeptics guide to the universe  Okay, in fact, I'm going to purchase a copy of that book by the same name by the same authors for you  I think you would you would find a lot of utility in it  
**[2:22:00-2:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:22:00):**  But that's one of the things that I have I've learned over the years listening to that particular podcast  It's spearheaded by the New England Skeptical Society and the guy is dr. Steven Novella  Who's a neurologist at I don't know Yale or Princeton or you know, one of the big medical research facilities up there  
**[2:22:15-2:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:22:15):**  but he talks about how  You know how our memories change over time and there's nothing we can we can do about it and things that we know for certain  That happened to us are very likely  
**[2:22:24-2:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:22:24):**  Didn't happen that way at all and just how what a what a weird thing the the human brain and the human memory is  And it's yeah, it's definitely not like a digital record. It's definitely not a blockchain, right? I mean  I'm looking at the clock. Yeah, and we have that other thing. Hmm. Oh, yes in less than 20 minutes  
**[2:22:50-2:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:22:50):**  So let's wrap this up, right?  Where can anybody find you on the internet? How can people get a hold of you and where can people find?  More of your music. Hey, thank you for asking  
**[2:23:00-2:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:23:00):**  I usually say that hey, I'm I'm I'm just ubiquitous. I'm on the internet is usually the way I answer that question  I'm I do some I do some writing and have links to pretty much everything on my website at Aaron Travis calm  I have still have the the technology site  
**[2:23:16-2:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:23:16):**  I occasionally will write to at auctioneer tech calm and of course the band is Aaron Travis band  Calm and that's probably got most of the activity because with shows and things like that and the new music  We're getting ready to put out a new record here this I  
**[2:23:28-2:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:23:28):**  Can't say next year anymore because it is next year now. So here in the next month or two  We've got everything finished up. We finished it last month in the studio. And so we've got a new a new effort coming out  It's called real small town  
**[2:23:40-2:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:23:40):**  You know about about some of the challenges I've lived there. Yes  Absolutely. It's real small town  and it's also it also has probably the only song that I'm aware of that has the oglelala aquifer is  
**[2:23:51-2:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:23:51):**  one of the one of the lyrics in one of the songs so  We're really happy about that again. That's Aaron Travis band calm. Of course. I'm at Travis Travis TR a FFAS on Twitter  I'm on Facebook and Mastodon and I don't I don't think Twitter is gonna be too long for this world, but we shall see  
**[2:24:09-2:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:24:09):**  That's also another discussion for next time. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you want to do a Twitter?  My I got a chuckle out of one of the one of the memes that came came through the other day was  A Elon Musk is a stupid person's idea of what a genius is. I've seen that me chuckle. I've seen that  
**[2:24:26-2:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:24:26):**  I've had I've had other podcast guests compare him to Lex Luthor. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, that's fun. Yeah  I don't know. I I'm not sure where I'm at on Elon  cautiously watching I  
**[2:24:42-2:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:24:42):**  He can do whatever he wants a Twitter. Yeah. I think it's funny that two years ago  When like the quote the right wingers were upset with the censorship on Twitter like oh, we're gonna go to Mastodon  Everybody's I call Mastodon sucks. Don't go to Mastodon. Don't go Mastodon Mastodon  
**[2:24:58-2:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:24:58):**  It's horrible platform and now that Elon bought Twitter. It seems like everybody wants to go to Mastodon  And I'll be honest. I'm not real sure what it is  I've already got I've already probably spend too much time on social media. So  
**[2:25:12-2:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:25:12):**  Well, it's the recurring theme of this conversation is people don't make change until they're absolutely forced to and I think Elon buying Twitter might be  The change that forces people to finally jump ship  Or just quit using the product or that yeah or spend less time doom-scrolling. Yep. Yep. All right  
**[2:25:30-2:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:25:30):**  It's been it's been a hell of a lot of fun Aaron don't even know how long I've been going don't care  I hope you guys enjoyed the show and if the show notes aren't that great that's because I didn't take any  Thanks again for having me Brian. Well, thanks again. Thanks again for inviting me down to your awesome studio and  
**[2:25:47-2:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/98-Aaron-Traffas-Different-Perspectives-e1tc30h#t=2:25:47):**  With that gang you have a great week and we're out of here

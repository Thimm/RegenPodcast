**[0:00:52-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:00:52):**  Check the show notes for a link to that.  For this week, I have somebody that I've been trying to get on the show for quite a  while and several of you have also requested me to interview this guest.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:01):**  So after we got our email situation straightened around, I guess, and a little bit of time  zone confusion, I managed to make a connection with Fred Provenza and sat down and have a  great conversation.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:14):**  So here we go.  Thanks for joining me.  How are you today?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:17):**  I'm doing well, bro.  It's wonderful to be here with you.  Been looking forward to this.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:22):**  It's great to have you here.  I'm glad we finally got a chance to meet face to face and talk for a few minutes down  Fort Worth a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:29):**  That was really awesome.  It's always a privilege to be able to hear you talk, do one of your keynote addresses.  Something somebody told me the other day when I brought up that I was going to be doing  
**[0:01:42-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:42):**  this interview with you was just let him go because he loves to chase rabbit holes.  So just let him go chase rabbit holes that he can't chase when he's got just a one hour  time slot to fill.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:01:54):**  So I hope we'll find a couple of those today.  Well, I'm sure we will, Fred.  Between you and I, we'll find some to chase down.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:02:07):**  I've been hearing your name for a long time.  My dad has been a big fan of your work for a long time.  And I'll have to admit, I just started into nourishment a few days ago, and I'm an audiobook  
**[0:02:21-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:02:21):**  consumer.  So one of the big questions I have is, when are you going to narrate your own audiobooks?  You know, your timing actually couldn't be better.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:02:33):**  When the pandemic started, the folks at Chelsea Green's asked me if I would be interested  in doing an audio book.  And that's your publisher?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:02:46):**  Yes, Chelsea Green is a publisher.  And there's Fern Bradley Marshall is the lady I worked with that I edited with.  And she raised the idea.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:02:57):**  And at the time, I don't know why, but it didn't sound so interesting to me.  But I didn't say no at all.  And then as time went on, I think in part, I was working on a couple other projects and  
**[0:03:10-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:03:10):**  didn't feel like I had the time.  But as time went on, it sounded like more and more of a good idea.  And so I finally got into it and put together a narrative for it's an adaptation of the  
**[0:03:27-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:03:27):**  book, actually, the book, I think I was visiting with Ben Trollinger, who's editing this narration.  I think he was saying the books about 186,000 words, this narration is 75,000 words.  I about cut the book in half, basically, okay.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:03:48):**  And to try to stick with the big points to try to make stick with the main themes that  are in the book, not bog it down in too much detail.  There's a lot of particulars that are in the book in nourishment.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:04:06):**  And, you know, a lot of crossing the T's and dotting the I's and a lot of reference material  that that cited in there.  So this audio rendition is much more big picture in that sense.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:04:23):**  Ben was very happy with the narration.  In fact, he's going to send, well, I just saw on the email, he just sent me his comments  on it.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:04:33):**  And he's wanting me to have that back to him in about 10 days.  He said, it's going to be no problem.  So we're moving ahead on that audio book will be out fairly soon, actually.  
**[0:04:46-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:04:46):**  And this is stuff you can delete.  But you know, what I'm trying to convince those guys to do is let's put music with it.  Let's have a couple different people, me maybe doing some of the narration, but a real live  
**[0:05:00-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:00):**  narrative narrator doing some of it.  And let's make it come alive.  Let's use those different mediums to make it come alive.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:09):**  And Ben was really, really receptive today to doing that.  Now whether or not the people that say yes on those or no on those kind of things, go  for it.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:21):**  We'll see.  But I think there's so many ways to make things come alive and music is powerful.  And I think having more than one voice in there can be powerful if it's done in a good  
**[0:05:32-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:32):**  way.  That's a lot more probably than what you wanted on that book, but that's where we're going.  And I'm excited about it now.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:44):**  I'm excited.  I haven't looked at the script since I turned it over.  I've just set it aside.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:05:50):**  So I'll be able to look with fresh eyes here over the next week to 10 days as I go through  Ben's comments.  And yeah, so we're working on it.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:06:00):**  And I think I liked also, you know, there's some points.  There's five sections to the book.  Dining with change, dancing with the wisdom of the body, savoring the artist's palette,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:06:15):**  grappling with uncertainty, fading into mystery.  And then there's the last part that's dining on earth, the visitor's reflections.  I really, what I wanted to write the book about are those last sections, grappling with  
**[0:06:28-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:06:28):**  uncertainty, fading into mystery, and a visitor's reflections on being on this planet.  But I felt like I needed the first three sections to set the stage for those last sections.  This audio book is way more balanced in terms of really hitting those last sections pretty  
**[0:06:48-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:06:48):**  hard.  And there I think, there to me, well I think all of the books is worthwhile.  Of course, what would I say?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:07:01):**  But I think it's all worthwhile, those first three sections.  But I think without those last three sections, it's not the same book.  And the balance that's in there now with those three sections, I think, and I was very, very  
**[0:07:20-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:07:20):**  happy to hear Ben's comments without me egging him on in any way about the balance and the  shift in balance that's come from the book that you're reading and this audio version  of the book.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:07:34):**  So I want to know why you, what drove you to write the book.  But before we get into that, so you're Dr. Fred Provenza from the University of Utah,  right?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:07:46):**  Utah State University.  Utah State.  Yeah, University of Utah is in Salt Lake City and that's a common mistake that people make.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:07:56):**  Utah State is in Logan.  It's the State Land Grant College.  Okay.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:01):**  Thanks for clearing that up.  How did you get where you're at?  Where did you come from and what has been your life?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:10):**  Like tell me your life story.  Briefly.  It doesn't take long.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:15):**  It's a Ben.  No, I've really been blessed, I think.  But my wife asked me an interesting question a week or so ago, a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:24):**  She said, did you have expectations of your life?  Did you have any expectations of your life?  And I could truly tell her, no, I didn't have any expectations at all.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:35):**  What happened for me was just following things that fascinated me.  And from when I was a teeny little kid, I loved wild things.  If it moved, insect, fish, bird, mammal, I was just mesmerized by it.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:08:52):**  Absolutely just loved wild creatures.  So I used to love to catch everything.  I wanted to catch it all, you know, so I remember all the bees and moths and stuff that would  
**[0:09:08-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:09:08):**  land on the flowers that my mother grew in around the place and I'd catch them, catch  them, catch them.  And I remember one time my dear old grandmother was about five feet tall when she was stretched  
**[0:09:20-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:09:20):**  out.  She was babysitting with us one time and somehow I let all those things go in the house.  And so poor old Gram was up climbing on the cabinets all over the place.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:09:31):**  Gram, look, there's one over there, catch that.  Anyway, you know, I was just fascinated by wild things, animals especially.  Then when it came time to go to college, it made sense to get into wildlife biology.  
**[0:09:48-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:09:48):**  Not that I knew anything about it, I really didn't, but wildlife sounded like something  that I loved.  And when I was a sophomore in college at Colorado State University, I took a class in plant  
**[0:10:02-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:10:02):**  taxonomy and that just brought a world alive to me that I'd never seen before.  I'd been around my mother's, you know, she loved to grow plants and so forth, but I'd  never actually really looked at wild plants, grasses, forbs, shrubs, growing on rangelands  
**[0:10:19-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:10:19):**  until I took that class.  We were required to collect 50 plant species and identify them and so forth and that, I'm  saying those two things because that interest in wild creatures and then that interest in  
**[0:10:32-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:10:32):**  plants led me just naturally, I loved, you know, why do animals eat what they eat?  That was really as deep as it went for me, was, you know, just being fascinated by that  and then, you know, pursuing that over 40 years from a research standpoint that moved  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:10:54):**  from why do they eat what they eat and why do they go where they go to trying to understand  that.  How come they do that?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:11:02):**  Why do they do that?  And that led to all the studies of nutritional wisdom of the body and the different ways  that that works, ability to select for nutritional needs as well as for medicines and so forth.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:11:15):**  All that just evolved and then to kind of wind around where you started on that, when  I retired 13 years ago from Utah State University, my wife and I moved to the backwoods of Colorado.  We were 12 miles in on gravel road, living this.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:11:35):**  Living the dream.  Yeah, we were, honestly.  We always, from when we first met 50 or 50 years ago, we thought wouldn't it be cool  
**[0:11:44-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:11:44):**  to build your own cabin and live in the woods.  We both shared that dream but we never thought, you know, that that would actually, well it  did happen and we were living the dream.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:11:56):**  But part of when we got there to the backwoods, it was like, boy, I can be like a kid again.  You know, I don't want to study anything anymore.  I've been there, done that, it was fantastic but I just want to watch.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:12:09):**  I just want to sit here and watch all these plants and animals.  There was every kind of wild creature from bobcats and lynx to mountain lions to all  the, you know, pronghorns, mule deer, elk, moose, turkeys, on and on and on.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:12:25):**  It was just cool to be back there but I thought, you know, it would be a really nice time and  it helped with the transition of being in the middle of everything, all this activity.  All of a sudden you're 12 miles in, graveled roads, you're living alone.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:12:40):**  If there are people around, they don't know who you are, couldn't care less actually and  better.  Pretty much.  
**[0:12:46-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:12:46):**  Yeah, you know, don't want to be too noisy, nosy.  But anyway, it was great to time to reflect and just to sit down and try to write down  if I was to summarize all those things that we were doing and so forth.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:13:01):**  And so that, you know, that's a little bit about where the interest began.  However that starts in a person, it was just in me and then I ended up winding around to  the book and writing the book.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:13:15):**  And I'll add one other part.  So during all the years that we were studying processes, these flavor feedback relationships,  these biochemically mediated flavor feedback relationships between cells and organ systems  
**[0:13:29-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:13:29):**  in the palate, social learning starting in utero and early in life of what and what not  to eat, where and where not to go, what's a predator, what's not a predator, and then  how plant diversity, those are kind of the three things that we really studied, how plant  
**[0:13:44-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:13:44):**  diversity influences all of that stuff.  I was always thinking about humans and a lot of times when we devise studies, we'd be thinking,  well, how do we, you know, how do we respond to this or that?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:13:55):**  And then, you know, does a goat or a sheep or a cow do the same thing?  So we were always thinking about that, but I had never dived into the human literature  on those topics.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:14:06):**  And I thought, you know, this would be a great chance to just see what we studied.  And then do people study those same things in people?  Is there a literature related to us?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:14:19):**  And so that was a great opportunity to try.  You know, the literature on humans is like the Alpha and the Omega, there's no beginning  and no end.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:14:29):**  It doesn't agree.  You can find whatever you want to find literally out there in that literature.  But it was a chance to really familiarize myself and to try in the book to talk not  
**[0:14:42-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:14:42):**  only about goats and sheep and cows and wild and bison and wild kind of creatures, but  to talk about humans in that same breath as well.  It was fun to do that.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:14:56):**  It was really fun to do that.  And I go back to that expectation and what Sue asked, did you have expectations?  No.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:03):**  And I certainly would have never thought that an interest in why a cow or a goat eats what  it eats would lead to talking about humans.  You know, it just all evolved really.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:15):**  And it's that simple question.  Why do animals eat what they eat?  And we probably still don't have an answer to it.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:21):**  You know, you could look at it.  I can look at one of my cows eating on a willow tree and going, why does that cow eat that  willow tree?  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:28):**  Well, she wants some tannins that are in it.  That's my easy answer.  Okay, well, why does she want the tannins?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:33):**  How does she know that the tannins that she needs today are in that plant today and that  if she eats them, she'll be happy?  How does she know that?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:42):**  Like those are the questions, like every one of these questions that we start to challenge  something that's in established knowledge opens up a whole wide world of other questions.  And like you were saying, you originally started off by studying cows and wildlife and how  
**[0:15:58-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:15:58):**  they were making their nutritional choices through the day.  And that led you to look at people.  And I'm really under the impression from talking to doctors and folks in the medical field  
**[0:16:11-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:16:11):**  and just, you know, people that we know in the regenerative sphere, that most doctors  get about like a two day class on nutrition.  Like, and it kind of sums up to, well, you put things in this end and it comes out the  
**[0:16:24-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:16:24):**  other end, right?  I've always really wondered, and not necessarily on humans, but on cows, like, okay, so if  we can analyze everything going in, dry matter, nutrient balance, you know, carbohydrates,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:16:40):**  sugars and everything, and then we can catch the manure and we can catch the urine.  Why can't we compare what's coming in the front side to what's coming out the backside  and see what the cow actually used?  
**[0:16:51-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:16:51):**  Yes, well, and there's a lot of studies that do that too, Brian, back in the day, you know,  of nutrient utilization and so forth.  There have been a lot of work on digestion balance kind of trials.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:17:06):**  And you can imagine that there, anytime you get into trials on nutrition, it gets very  complex, very, very quickly, as you were alluding to, because often, you know, you have to choose  what are you going to feed that, what are you going to feed that cow?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:17:29):**  And there you've already limited possibilities compared to say on a rangeland setting where  maybe an animal has 50, 75 different foods that they'll sample and so forth.  And so I'm not saying that to throw cold water or be negative, but whether you're studying  
**[0:17:45-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:17:45):**  a human or a cow or whatever it is, those, it puts animals in a box, it puts animals  in a box, and you're only going to be able to make, draw conclusions based on the particulars  of the study that you did.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:18:04):**  And so that ends up being a, it's a huge limitation compared to when animals are able to free  range across, like I love your background there, across an area like that, each one  able to select what its body, I would argue what its body needs.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:18:25):**  But that's where you're so right, what you say.  So willow and tannins, certainly we know willows have tannins, they have salicylic acid, which  we call the aspirin, right, as well.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:18:37):**  And so maybe the cow has a headache that day, it's learned, you know, we showed that animals  can learn to self-medicate for multiple kinds of maladies that like us with, if we have  a headache, we'll take an aspirin, if we have a stomach ache, we'll take Pepto Bismol, we  
**[0:18:52-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:18:52):**  were showing that, that animals can learn to self-medicate for multiple different kinds  of maladies.  And so I think your comments really appropriate.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:19:04):**  We when I think of the work that we did over 40 years of studying, studying, studying these  things, I think it points in a direction, it points in a direction, but do we know every  last, every last bit about that knot at all, how we really don't, I think what it leads  
**[0:19:22-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:19:22):**  to is something like we're doing now, a good, it can have an interesting conversation about  all those things, you know.  Well, you think of the complexity, for instance, in meat, we're doing a bunch of studies of  
**[0:19:33-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:19:33):**  meat right now, and how the diversity of plants in the diet, what I would refer to as the  phytochemical complexity, all these different compounds that are in plants, the hundreds,  if not thousands, you know, get into the meat, and meat itself can have 45,000 different  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:19:50):**  compounds.  Just imagine that, and imagine that the body knows what to do with that.  It's a wisdom.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:19:58):**  You know, when we were first starting our research, and for me, it came out of watching  animals and watching animals do strange things, goats eating woodrat houses, goats avoiding  eating twigs that we thought were most nutritious and eating stuff that we thought was, it's  
**[0:20:16-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:20:16):**  like, why are they doing that?  And I always gave them credit.  I always thought, you know, they know there's something going on that we don't know.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:20:25):**  And so then we would study that.  But when we started formally then, into the research that occupied 40 some years, I remember  writing papers and saying, you know, somehow creatures had to be able to figure this out.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:20:41):**  They were, our ancestors included, we were making a living long before there were medical  doctors or pharmacists or biochemists or all these things.  What we're trying to do is simply, I think if we think of it from a humility standpoint,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:20:59):**  we're just trying to understand the wisdom that's in these systems and trying to think,  and the whole regen movement, I think, regenerative ag movement that I really appreciate, I think  trying to say, well, there is this wisdom in nature and in natural systems.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:21:16):**  And we probably do well to try to understand and appreciate and then to manage based on  some of that knowledge and wisdom.  So I've been thinking about this for a long time.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:21:31):**  Part of the problem that we're having in regenerative agriculture with explaining how some of these  natural systems work and how building soil biome and soil microbial communities, how  that works is because it's extremely difficult to study it in the lab.  
**[0:21:51-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:21:51):**  Building complexity in a lab is extremely hard because in a lab, science, what you're  trying to do is you're trying to eliminate all the variables that you can and just get  to a control and then tweak a couple of variables to see how it responds.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:22:08):**  But in a natural system with livestock and native and plants outside, you have zero control.  Your control comes down to where you want those livestock to be.  That's the tool that I can affect.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:22:24):**  And then I just have to observe how my livestock are interacting with the grass and what they're  eating.  I see what they're eating.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:22:32):**  If there's no more in the pasture, okay, maybe it's time to put you in another pasture because  you want to eat that and there's no more left.  But I guess what I'm getting at is studying complexity.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:22:44):**  We kind of touched on nutritional about the balance between in and out and what the animal  or organism is using.  To some extent, that's been done.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:22:55):**  There's feed trials.  We can feed them this, this, this, and this, and they'll gain this much a day.  That's great.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:23:04):**  That has absolutely nothing to do with anything that happens in the real world.  In kind of tagging a conversation I was having with my hired hand, Keaton, the other day,  the show ring, it's all fake.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:23:18):**  To some extent, a lot of science, oh boy, I just dug myself.  I just jumped in a hole there.  A lot of science, it's difficult to apply in the real world in a natural system because  
**[0:23:32-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:23:32):**  there's so many variables.  Yes, and you didn't dig yourself into a hole at all.  No, you're grappling with, and that's the whole point of that section of the book, grappling  
**[0:23:43-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:23:43):**  with uncertainty.  When you get there, a nourishment.  Going back to the audio adaptation of the book, I was very happy to hear what Ben was  
**[0:23:53-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:23:53):**  saying, how well that came across, how all these issues.  Let's just take human nutrition, which was what Ben was talking about today, and what  that section on grappling with uncertainty gets into is.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:24:07):**  Every time you turn around, they're changing the advice, right?  Are eggs good for you or bad for you?  Is coffee good for you or bad for you?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:24:14):**  On and on and on and on.  That grappling with uncertainty really explores what you're attempting to explore right now.  The complexity, the complexity of it all, and how you start with, for one, no two individuals  
**[0:24:34-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:24:34):**  have ever been alike on this planet.  That's amazing if you start to think about that.  If you just that no two humans, no two cows, no two anything, chipmunks, no two grass plants,  
**[0:24:48-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:24:48):**  and it has to do with the relationship between genes and gene expression, this whole field  of epigenetics and ever-changing environments.  There's no way anything that's amazing to me to think about that.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:25:03):**  People often say nature abhors a vacuum, I say nature abhors sameness.  Nature loves diversity.  That's why all those weeds grow up in the monocrop fields.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:25:14):**  Nature wants some diversity.  It absolutely is.  It absolutely is.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:25:20):**  You can work yourself to death or spray yourself to death or however you want to, but nature  abhors sameness.  It's amazing.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:25:32):**  You run a study, and we made a point of this the last maybe, I don't know, 10, 15 years  of my career of always pointing out, because in research, as you're saying, just to back  up a second, you have treatments, say you have two treatments, and you're going to look  
**[0:25:49-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:25:49):**  are the average animal do something different in one treatment versus another treatment.  What's so obvious is that within your treatment groups, even if you have statistically significant  differences, the individuals are going to vary like crazy within those groups.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:26:06):**  You're going to see a great amount of variation.  So we made a point always to highlight the variation and that these individuals aren't  doing the same things.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:26:17):**  I think back to the original work with goats, where we were using them as mobile pruning  machines down in southern Utah to prune this shrub called black brush.  When it's in the winter, it stimulates all this new growth that we knew based on lab  
**[0:26:32-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:26:32):**  analysis was more nutritious, higher in energy, protein, minerals, and so forth.  But the goats didn't want to eat it.  When I say the goats didn't, that means 80 to 90% of the goats in any one trial, 10 to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:26:46):**  20% thought it was wonderful.  So all that has implications for how nature works, right?  Is the plant poisonous or not poisonous?  
**[0:26:57-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:26:57):**  Larkspur for instance, is a big issue with livestock losses.  People at the poisonous plants lab looked at five different breeds of cattle, and there  was more variation within a breed than there were across the different breeds in terms  
**[0:27:13-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:27:13):**  of their ability to tolerate the alkaloids that are in Larkspur.  I was going to say something about that, that there's more differentiation from one end  of the Angus breed to the other than there is between the average of all the breeds.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:27:33):**  Yes, absolutely.  It's a really key point.  That's one of the reasons that I'm thinking of a paper I just reviewed out of Australia  
**[0:27:43-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:27:43):**  for a nutrition journal where they're talking about how important choices of different protein  sources are, how important that is to the diet.  Now that we're talking about changing climates and we should all be eating plant-based diets  
**[0:27:58-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:27:58):**  and so forth, and they're making the argument that diversity of protein sources is very  important.  And one of my recommendations on that paper, I think it's a really good paper.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:28:13):**  They're talking about that meat is an important part of this as well, meat and dairy kind  of products.  But we made that argument forever from a livestock standpoint because no two individuals are  
**[0:28:25-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:28:25):**  alike.  Diversity enables individuality.  It enables individuals to meet their needs and to grow and produce.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:28:34):**  And we are going down rabbit holes because I'm thinking back to where we were started.  But that alone complicates any study you want to do.  Then, as you were saying, you need to decide which subset of foods are you going to feed  
**[0:28:49-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:28:49):**  and automatically you've reduced the universe of what's possible.  And so you draw conclusions.  But an individual that's foraging for itself has so many choices and those choices and  
**[0:29:06-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:29:06):**  those combination of choices matter hugely in terms of health.  I remember one of your comments made me think back.  You always start out naive.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:29:21):**  And I'm sure as you were saying, still we're really naive.  That's the danger.  You start thinking, you know a little bit.

**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:29:33):**  And I love Einstein's equation.  Ego equals one divided by knowledge.  The more you learn.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:29:40):**  And that's what I think about as we went along.  You know, we were doing all those studies.  The more we did, the more you realize everything is hooked to everything else.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:29:52):**  Whatever you're doing is linked to something else.  Any choice you make.  You know, so you're running a trial to see can cattle select for phosphorus if they're  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:02):**  deficient in phosphorus, for example.  Well you've got to really think a lot.  This is obvious.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:07):**  But you've got to think a lot about what's the basal diet?  What am I feeding them outside of that?  And that's, you know, so you want to make sure they're deficient in phosphorus and so  
**[0:30:18-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:18):**  forth.  But there are nuances to that that really struck me over the years.  We weren't thinking about this or that or the other thing that was no doubt influencing  
**[0:30:28-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:28):**  the outcome of our studies.  And we got hit with that several times.  And in interesting ways that were just revelatory.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:39):**  It's like, oh my gosh, yeah, we should have been thinking about that.  We weren't thinking about that.  That was influencing the outcome.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:45):**  If we change that, now we get a different outcome to our study.  So we were continually learning.  But I remember one study, we were working with sheep and we were asking a question about  
**[0:30:59-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:30:59):**  phosphorus deficiency and could they self-select for phosphorus.  And we couldn't get the group that was on the phosphorus deficient diet, we were monitoring  their blood phosphorus levels to see if they were deficient.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:31:13):**  And I couldn't get their levels to drop.  And we started really paying attention to what was going on.  They were sticking their heads through the wire panels and eating the feces of sheep  
**[0:31:25-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:31:25):**  that were in adjacent pens that were on the phosphorus adequate diet.  So they were getting their phosphorus from, you know, and we'd never seen that.  We'd never seen sheep eating feces at Green Canyon.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:31:37):**  We'd never seen them digging soil and eating it until we made them deficient.  You just freaked out every sheep guy that listens to this podcast.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:31:46):**  Well, you know, and those are things that you just think, oh, that's amazing.  That's really interesting.  And, you know, they were becoming deficient.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:31:55):**  It caused them to try unusual things.  And that's a classic deal when, you know, bone chewing, for instance, in cattle, that's  a good sign that they are deficient in phosphorus.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:32:06):**  They're not just kind of whacked out or something.  And that wouldn't be a calcium problem.  Well, it can be calcium or phosphorus both, you know, and ratios of phosphorus to calcium  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:32:18):**  and so forth.  But some of the really neat work did tie that deficit to phosphorus.  But it could be calcium too, just as you're saying, you know.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:32:28):**  Well, I mean, if a cow is chewing on a bone, I think that, well, bones are mostly calcium.  That would be my first thought.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:32:36):**  I haven't studied nutrition in my whole life.  Also a good source of phosphorus as well.  And so, but, you know, the further along we went, you just realize that we were really  
**[0:32:49-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:32:49):**  interested in the role that mother plays in food selection.  And it's amazing to watch the relationship between mother and young after birth.  And so we, the first studies were just looking at if we trained mom to eat one food and avoid  
**[0:33:06-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:33:06):**  another food, would she train her lambs?  And it's so obvious and so amazing when you see that.  You know, you and I are talking now, we're using words as our medium.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:33:18):**  But when you actually see something like that, we had a road show actually that traveled  around for a while.  I remember we went over to Nevada and AG Smith actually came to that, to that one of those  
**[0:33:33-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:33:33):**  presentations where we were showing our trained sheep.  But it was great to get people's attention because it would just blow their mind when  you'd see them doing things, eating things you'd never thought they'd eat, avoiding things  
**[0:33:44-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:33:44):**  that you think this is ice cream plant.  And then we'd simply say, well, how many ways can you think that you could get a sheep to  do those kinds of things or a cow or whatever it is?  
**[0:33:55-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:33:55):**  But yeah, so we'd start with mother and we did a lot of studies like that.  Then we started thinking, well, you know, maybe cues in mother's milk, mom's eating  foods and flavors get in.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:34:07):**  So then we started studying milk and then we started thinking, well, you know, that  fetus, that fetal taste system is fully functional during the last trimester of gestation.  Maybe they're even starting to learn in the womb.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:34:19):**  And so it's that kind of thing that I'm getting more specific on where you'd see, man, you  know, and then you start thinking epigenetically, well, probably the mother of those animals  and the grandmother and the great grandmother is all these linkages in time and space.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:34:37):**  And you appreciate what you're saying about the complexity of the whole thing and how  little we probably do know about the wisdom that's in nature and in all these creatures.  We talk about epigenetics a lot on this podcast.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:34:55):**  I don't know if we've ever really kind of broken it down into what it means or what  that concept kind of relates to.  Could you do that for us?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:35:04):**  Sure.  I'll go down a rabbit hole here.  Feet first.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:35:10):**  You know, so I remember writing a review paper when I was a young faculty member and I was  writing in there and I didn't have much basis for this, but I said experiences early in  life cause neurological, morphological and physiological changes in animals.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:35:28):**  They change how they are neurologically, morphologically, physiologically and behaviorally.  It just made sense, but I couldn't cite a ton of things.  So as we went along and we were doing these experiences early in life, we would start  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:35:42):**  to sacrifice animals and we'd look at their organ systems.  We'd look at rumen development, papilla development in the rumen.  What's the size of the rumen?  
**[0:35:51-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:35:51):**  We'd look at livers and liver sizes and function.  Other friends looked at kidneys and kidney function and these experiences were changing  all of those things.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:36:02):**  For instance, let's get a little specific and then some of the work we did with the  goats on black brush, we ran a study where we reared goats either on a high quality diet,  alfalfa hay and so forth versus just born and reared down on black brush.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:36:21):**  And then we looked at when we brought the animals that were reared on the higher quality  diet in another environment, when we brought them to the black brush, we ran trials over  a couple of months.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:36:35):**  We looked at how much black brush they would eat.  We looked at how their weight changed or not.  Really the goats that had experienced a two and a half times more black brush than the  
**[0:36:47-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:36:47):**  naive goats.  They did better weight wise.  When we gave all the goats a choice between alfalfa, which the one goats were familiar  
**[0:36:57-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:36:57):**  with and black brush, the goats that were born and raised on black brush ate much more  black brush meal in meal out, even if alfalfa was offered ad libitum to them.  The other goats totally abandoned the black brush.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:37:14):**  So we were having these differences and we were looking at organ systems and how they  responded.  I'll give you another example and then I'll let's wind it back.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:37:26):**  We have some friends in Australia who were looking at out in Western Australia, they  have a shrub called salt brush and that dominates some of their landscapes.  And they were looking at rearing animals on those salt brush range lands versus grass  
**[0:37:44-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:37:44):**  range lands and they were looking in utero at what the experience did.  And they showed that the sheep that were reared on salt brush in utero that were exposed in  utero ate significantly more salt brush.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:00):**  They drank less water.  They were able to perform much better on those landscapes than the animals that were naive  to them.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:08):**  Then they started looking at kidney development, kidney function and they were showing that  it had all changed for those animals.  So I was working with a person, it was near the end of my career, the beginning of his  
**[0:38:22-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:22):**  career.  He was trained in epigenetics and he knew about our research.  He was very familiar with the work we'd done and I was talking to him.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:31):**  We were going to watch a movie actually titled Ghost in Your Genes.  It's a Nova special about epigenetics.  It's a fabulous, fabulous, fabulous if you want people to get a primer on epigenetics,  
**[0:38:44-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:44):**  watch Ghost in Your Genes.  It's riveting to me.  And we were going to watch that and I said, you know, he was talking about the work we  
**[0:38:53-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:38:53):**  did and I said, yeah, we never really studied epigenetics and he said, yes, you did.  And I really appreciated his comment because he understood that that's what we were studying,  how genes get expressed as a function of the environment that an animal is in during conception  
**[0:39:18-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:39:18):**  early in life.  And when I said we weren't studying epigenetics, what I meant is we weren't looking at the  specific suites of genes that were being upregulated or downregulated.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:39:31):**  But I very much appreciated that he understood that what we were looking at was the outcome  of that when we looked at different organ systems in the body.  And when we looked at behaviors of animals, we were looking at that gene expression and  
**[0:39:47-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:39:47):**  how that turns out in terms of it was striking when you, you know, those goats, the goats  that were reared on black brush, when we cut them open and looked inside, their rumens  were enormous.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:39:59):**  They were absolutely enormous.  You think about it and you think if you've got a really poor quality forage, the best  thing you can do is get a lot of it in there to digest, right?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:40:12):**  If you've got the goats that were reared on the higher quality diet, they had little  tiny rumens because they didn't need a big rumen to digest and meet their needs.  The quality was high enough.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:40:23):**  So what are you saying when you talk about high quality forage?  Because in my mind, high quality forage is something that's going to be energy intensive  to grow and transport.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:40:40):**  We're talking about sorghum, or some wheat, corn or rye or something, right?  Not pasture native plants.  Yeah.  
**[0:40:51-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:40:51):**  And when I say, let's do clarify that, when I say high quality on that black brush study,  it's relative, the black brush is a very poor quality, very fibrous, poorly digestible,  not good source of energy or protein or minerals.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:41:11):**  And what we were comparing that with then was the animals that were reared on a high  quality alfalfa hay, grass hay ration.  And probably we had a little grain.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:41:22):**  It's been a long, long time ago since we did that.  We probably supplemented them with a little bit of grain as well.  So they were just on a way higher plane of nutrition compared to those poor goats that  
**[0:41:32-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:41:32):**  were down there eking out and living on the black brush.  So what epigenetic changes would you expect to see?  Let me back up.  
**[0:41:47-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:41:47):**  So how does the body's natural nutritional wisdom deal with these substances that now  that we're eating as people and sometimes we're passing on to our livestock, these substances  that short circuit the body's ability to tell you when it's had enough and to induce the  
**[0:42:06-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:42:06):**  feeling of society and satisfaction?  Yeah.  That raises a really huge point and one can think about that point from the standpoint  
**[0:42:22-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:42:22):**  of livestock that are offered, let's say on rangeland or on pasture, a diverse array of  different plant species versus say livestock that are on a monoculture.  So they don't have much choice in terms of the foods they get or in a feedlot where they're  
**[0:42:41-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:42:41):**  fed a total mixed ration.  Those would be three kind of degrees that I think about when it comes to livestock.  From a human standpoint, I think about ultra processed foods as one end of the spectrum  
**[0:42:58-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:42:58):**  and then wholesome foods at the other end of the spectrum.  I think one of the things that struck me as much as any, if we stay on the human for just  a minute here, we can go back to the livestock.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:43:14):**  And I think Mark Shaxter did a wonderful job of just nailing this topic in his book, The  Dorito Effect.  And he makes the point that, and for those of us old enough to have experienced this,  
**[0:43:29-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:43:29):**  we remember that two things happen more or less simultaneously.  The flavors of wholesome foods, vegetables, the varieties of different vegetables, fruits,  meats as well became blander during the last, let's say 40, 50 years.  
**[0:43:50-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:43:50):**  At the same time, these ultra processed foods became irresistible.  And so we really, we disincentivized real foods because they don't taste good anymore.  And the food industry really figured out how to incentivize these ultra processed foods  
**[0:44:07-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:44:07):**  and flavorings and with artificial flavorings and all that they do, they really figured  out how to do that.  And so it ended this up in a situation where this wisdom of the body that's been with us  
**[0:44:23-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:44:23):**  over the eons got hijacked, basically.  You know, if you have real foods, one of the points that I emphasize so much is that when  a body is exposed to really nutritious foods, we like the flavors of those foods because

That cells and organ systems, including the microbiome of the body, simply feeding back  through these hormones and neurotransmitters and peptides and so forth to change our liking  
**[0:44:58-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:44:58):**  for the food as a function of need.  And when we're on wholesome foods that are grown on good soils and good varieties of  foods, you know, phytochemically and biochemically rich varieties, that richness of flavor is  
**[0:45:15-0:45:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:45:15):**  our body cells and organ systems telling us this is good.  We like this.  On the other hand, so many of the foods nowadays look great in the store, but they have very  
**[0:45:27-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:45:27):**  little flavor at all.  And for anyone who grows their own food, Sue and I have done that for our lifetime.  You know, when we hit the dead of winter and we don't have the stuff that we can pick fresh  
**[0:45:46-0:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:45:46):**  anymore, it's a rougher time for us.  We miss that because the flavors are great.  And same thing can be said with meat as well.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:46:00):**  That topic that we're doing a lot of study on nowadays and I think in the next decade  or so, we're going to learn a tremendous amount about how the diversity of plants in the diets  of livestock really has an influence on the phytochemical and biochemical richness of meat  
**[0:46:23-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:46:23):**  and dairy products.  You know, that's something that people originally for a long time, certainly we looked at ratios  of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids and CLAs.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:46:34):**  But this idea that phytochemicals actually get into the meat and fat and that they can  influence and that they can be there in concentrations that are probably meaningful, that's something  that wasn't so much on the radar screen.  
**[0:46:46-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:46:46):**  So it's a whole area that's open to explore nowadays from a metabolomic standpoint where  you can look at the diversity of compounds that are in meat and dairy, but also from  a human feeding trial standpoint, which gets into some of the complexity we were talking  
**[0:47:08-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:47:08):**  about earlier.  But you know what I'm looking forward to seeing is studies where, for instance, you compare  three meals.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:47:19):**  Let's just say we compare three meals that we feed to a human.  We have one that's grown best regen kind of practices that you can find.  And there's some neat review papers are just coming out now that you may have seen too,  
**[0:47:32-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:47:32):**  talking about the paired farms across the country and showing that the vegetables that  were grown on those are much, much higher in nutrients as well as these phytochemicals  compared to.  
**[0:47:48-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:47:48):**  So let's say we have a meal where you've got vegetables and meat that's grown on really  phytochemically rich, wholesome soils and so forth.  And you compare that with a conventional meal that has vegetables and it has meat, but the  
**[0:48:06-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:48:06):**  vegetables are coming from the grocery store.  They have no flavor to them.  You eat them because you're told you should eat them.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:48:17):**  So you eat them and the meat's coming from animals that are coming through the feedlot.  And then let's compare that those two meals with an ultra processed meal, a kind of Western  diet.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:48:28):**  Let's look at these markers of health that people like to look at.  I just reviewed another paper, a different paper that was comparing these alternative  meat to meat products that are plant based with meat from animals in coming from a feedlot.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:48:50):**  And they expected that the plant based meats there'd be far less inflammation following  the meal, inflammatory markers.  There wasn't.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:48:58):**  And the researchers were quite surprised by that.  So a person could look at inflammation.  People may or may not realize that anytime we eat a meal, there's an inflammatory response  
**[0:49:15-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:49:15):**  in our body.  And the more wholesome the foods, the less the inflammatory response is.  So one could look at markers of inflammation like these researchers did.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:49:26):**  They looked at 90 some markers.  And there are many other markers that people who are way into this would recommend that  we could look at.  
**[0:49:37-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:49:37):**  But to me, those kinds of studies would be revealing in terms of the linkages between  healthy soils, the plants that are grown on those soils, the animals that forage on healthy  mixes of diverse mixes of plants, and then our human health as well.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:50:02):**  Nutrient density.  We're talking about nutrient density in the foods that we eat.  My current paradigm in my head is meat.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:50:11):**  We're talking about nutrient density of meat.  So break it down.  Is there a difference in the nutrient density profile, the omega-6, the omega-3 ratio between  
**[0:50:23-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:50:23):**  holistically raised, regeneratively grazed, grass-fed beef, and typical feedlot beef?  Yes, yes.  And when it comes to ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, which historically people  
**[0:50:39-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:50:39):**  argue we're closer to one to one with all the processed foods that we've got nowadays,  both omega-3 and omega-6, and this is background, but just to make clear, both omega-3 and omega-6  are essential fatty acids.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:50:54):**  We need them.  Our body needs them.  But when we get a very high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, it can interfere with the absorption  
**[0:51:01-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:51:01):**  of omega-3.  So they argue we need more of a balance and that when we're on all these ultra-processed  foods, they have a lot of omega-6s.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:51:11):**  So back to the meat, animals that are on grain-fed diets have much higher levels of omega-6s  relative to omega-3s compared to animals that are foraging on diverse mixtures of plant  species.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:51:33):**  That'll come to be much more of a one to one ratio.  And that's meaningful and higher levels of conjugated linobleic acid, for instance, in  animals that are foraging on…  
**[0:51:46-0:52:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:51:46):**  What's that for the body?  It's good for health and for heart health and so forth.  But what we're finding is certainly the work that we're doing is supporting those,  
**[0:52:05-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:52:05):**  that past kind of findings.  But we're also finding much, much higher levels of various kinds of phytochemicals  that are antioxidants, anti-inflammatory.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:52:17):**  They promote health and they're in meaningful amounts and just way higher levels when animals  are foraging on diverse mixtures of plant species, either on pasture or on rangeland.  And let me add one qualifier here too.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:52:33):**  I often talk about on rangelands, animals can eat as many as 50, 75 plant species in  a day and maybe three to five make up the bulk of the diet.  But they'll pick a little bit here and a little bit there.  
**[0:52:46-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:52:46):**  And that's probably really meaningful in terms of their health.  But there's studies going on in New Zealand nowadays where they're feeding four to six  plant species that are really complimentary of one another and seeing huge benefits.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:53:02):**  So I add that because it's not like, well, if your plant, if your pasture doesn't have  50 species, you're probably going nowhere.  It's to say diversity and complementarities of different species, you can get some amazing,  
**[0:53:17-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:53:17):**  amazing results even with three to five, six, seven different plant species.  Good stuff.  And so when you're saying phytochemicals, in my mind, I'm also hearing flavonoids and  
**[0:53:32-0:53:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:53:32):**  terpenes, those compounds that give the food a little bit of different flavors.  And probably the term that most people would come up with when they hear grass-fed is gamey.  And it's not gamey.  
**[0:53:48-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:53:48):**  I don't think it's gamey.  The flavors I get in my mouth from grass-fed meat, like my mind ties those to plants.  Like when I'm eating that meat, I can almost see in my head what plants that cow had a  
**[0:54:04-0:54:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:54:04):**  lot of for the last six months before she went to go meet her date at freezer camp.  I love that you said that because actually if you get really familiar with what your  animals are eating and the different compounds that they contain, and you know, that's a  
**[0:54:22-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:54:22):**  process and not every people don't have to do that.  But it comes alive in that way that you're talking about.  It makes me think of, you know, I used to love to hunt bluegrouse all my life.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:54:36):**  And Sue and I were living in Utah.  We used to hunt them throughout the fall and late into the fall.  Early in the fall, they're eating really diverse mixtures of different kind of leaves and fruits  
**[0:54:46-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:54:46):**  and so forth on grasses, forbs, shrubs.  But as it gets into say late November, the availability of those isn't so much anymore.  And they move into the conifer trees and they start to eat the needles from those trees.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:03):**  And actually a lot's known about grouse and they're very selective of the trees they go  into because the conifer needles are high in terpenes.  So the challenge is those terpenes, if they eat too much, they can be toxic to the grouse.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:16):**  So the grouse has to find trees that are a good mix between the protein and energy in  the tree and the amount of terpene in the tree.  And that's going to vary across the environment.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:26):**  So the grouse are doing that.  But when you shoot a grouse that time of year, it's got a subtle, subtle hint of terpene.  It's just exactly what you're talking about.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:35):**  You can taste that little piney.  Yes, yes, yes.  And it's not strong.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:40):**  It's not overwhelming.  But definitely you can taste it, you know.  And so I remember the first time I hunted them late into the fall and I was thinking  
**[0:55:48-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:48):**  that, do I like this or don't I like this?  I'm not sure it was different.  You know, it was different from the way grouse normally tasted.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:55:57):**  And I make that point because I think I totally agree with you on the gamey.  And I think our palates have become dumbed down.  One thing that feedlots are able to do to say some words for pro the feedlot, you know,  
**[0:56:12-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:56:12):**  that they're very efficient in terms of producing animals.  They've reduced the cost so that many people are able to have meat, which is a huge benefit.  And another thing they've done is to make things pretty uniform, right?  
**[0:56:27-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:56:27):**  You fairly well know what the meat's going to taste like that you're getting.  If you think of my friend Dave Pratt when he talks about him in Ranching for Profit,  when he's talking about some of these kind of things, he's talking about McDonald's and  
**[0:56:40-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:56:40):**  he says, you may hate McDonald's, but you know what you're going to get.  You know what you're going to get every time you go there.  Same with the feedlot.  
**[0:56:49-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:56:49):**  One of the things that I think people need to start to appreciate is what you're saying.  This notion of terroir that when I was in France several years ago, going with the shepherds  up to their different places and looking at how they produce their milk and also their  
**[0:57:08-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:57:08):**  meat, each one was unique because of the landscape that they lived in and the way their animals  foraged.  And so when you go down to the market, they may say, well, I really like Gascon's cheese.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:57:21):**  I like the flavors of his cheese better than Michel's.  So that was just an acquired preference, right?  But they appreciated that flavor of the land that you were talking about.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:57:37):**  And I think in a way, what happens with us is our palates have become dumbed down.  I worked with people from around the globe over the years I was at Utah State and a lot  of times they said, your meat has no flavor.  
**[0:57:52-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:57:52):**  Your meat has no, we don't like your meat, it has no flavor.  And what they were saying is what you're saying is that you get, you know, when they're eating  this rich array of plants, you get hints of different tones or I'm not a food flavor taster  
**[0:58:09-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:58:09):**  kind of guy, but you get all these different tones and things that are in that meat as  a function.  So if you come to appreciate that and then to appreciate that those compounds can have  
**[0:58:20-0:58:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:58:20):**  health benefits in your body, then that can change your whole view of what's going on  with the meat.  So how do you feel about fake meat?  
**[0:58:35-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:58:35):**  What's the nutritional value of fake meat to the human body?  Yeah, you know, I just, for me, it's just one more ultra processed food, one more ultra  processed food.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:58:49):**  The paper I mentioned that I just reviewed said,  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were talking about inflammation and fake meat.  Let's go back there and chase that inflammation.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:58:59):**  They were, you know, they were trying to look at is there value in the plant based meats  and I don't want to be, the paper isn't out yet and it's a follow up to one that was published,  but they, you know, their hypothesis and they say this, their hypothesis was that the plant  
**[0:59:17-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:59:17):**  based meats would be lower markers of inflammation.  But out of these 92 markers they looked at, or 96, I forget, 92, 96, there were only four  that showed any difference whatsoever.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:59:30):**  And in both cases for the meat from the feedlot as well as the fake meat, they both were showing  a rise in terms of inflammation.  So they said, you know, we saw no difference here.  
**[0:59:46-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=0:59:46):**  Our hypothesis wasn't correct.  And then they went into some, you know, explanations for why that was the case.  And I very much appreciated what they were saying and was able to point out points that  
**[1:00:05-1:00:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:00:05):**  we're making right now that, you know, this nutrient density, how the food's raised, where  it's raised, all those things are going to be very important to be considering in terms  of inflammation and what's happening with a body.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:00:24):**  And, you know, so in their case, the plants, and I won't say too much about the particulars,  but you know, so where did those plants come from?  How were the plants raised that were made on the meat?  
**[1:00:37-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:00:37):**  All those things, you know, it's not trivial in my mind what we're talking about, what  people like to say we are what we eat and what we eat eats eats and all those kinds  of things.  
**[1:00:49-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:00:49):**  Well, you know, let's really make that real.  Let's get down to what is that then.  And as we're saying and alluding to, my friend and colleague, and I think you may have met  
**[1:01:02-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:01:02):**  him at the Grass-fed Exchange, Stefan von Vliet, but Stefan's really running and gunning.  And there's just a world of studies that can be done to try to explore this area.  I think that it's really a worthwhile area of research, even given as we were saying  
**[1:01:22-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:01:22):**  that, you know, there's always limitations on research.  But if you get into an area and you explore it well enough and you're thinking holistically  about it, you're not bogged down in the weeds, I think there can be some really nice contributions  
**[1:01:37-1:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:01:37):**  that get made.  And I think in this area of diet diversity for animals and humans as well, and what that  can do in terms of our health, that's a huge area, but I think very important.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:01:56):**  And then as we're saying, the beauty to me is that it links things holistically.  It's not just about, you know, well, what did that cow eat?  It's about where did that come from?  
**[1:02:08-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:02:08):**  What are the soils?  I like to say, and I sound like a broken record, but I think plants turn dirt into soil and  diverse mixtures of plants turn soil into homes, grocery stores, and pharmacies for  
**[1:02:21-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:02:21):**  creatures below and above ground.  To me, that sums up so much of the work that's going on, you can unpack all that.  But if you want to look at life below ground, from the microorganisms to the macro fauna  
**[1:02:36-1:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:02:36):**  that's below ground, you know, that's what plants do.  It gives them homes, places to live, grocery stores, the nutrients they need, and pharmacies  for them to keep themselves healthy when they get sick or need to self-medicate.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:02:56):**  And it's the same thing for creatures above ground, of course, as well.  And if we tie into that, and you know, I know that can sound strange.  And you know, if you're a medical doctor going back to what you were talking about earlier,  
**[1:03:13-1:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:03:13):**  and you've been, you know, you've had years and years and years of in-depth biochemistry,  physiology and on and on and on.  It may, I think sometimes, or a nutritionist who's done that, it may be hard to step back  
**[1:03:32-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:03:32):**  and think, well, you know, bodies had to know how to do all this stuff.  And then how can we enable that?  Because there weren't such things as medical doctors or pharmacists, as I've said, or any  
**[1:03:43-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:03:43):**  of those things back in the day.  So and I know when we were first starting our research years ago, I wrote papers arguing  that when we were first launching it and trying to make the case, this is worth studying,  
**[1:03:56-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:03:56):**  you know, probably, that, you know, well, how could it have been 10, 20,000, 50,000  years ago?  How are they getting along without any of that?  
**[1:04:07-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:04:07):**  Well, there must be this knowledge and how does that work?  How is that working?  Like mushrooms, like what, two million kinds of mushrooms, almost all are edible once.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:04:20):**  Very, very few are edible twice.  How do we figure that out?  Yeah, you know, I think that's one of the most fascinating things on the planet.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:04:32):**  You talk about an interesting topic.  It makes me think and I'll wind around, there are studies done in ants and they had poison  taster ants, and they were a subset of the population that tasted these different things  
**[1:04:46-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:04:46):**  to see if they were toxic or not.  Maybe we had poison taster humans.  No, but you know, there really are, there were studies of poison taster ants and I talk  
**[1:04:58-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:04:58):**  about it in nourishment.  But you know, I think that's fascinating.  How did people figure all that stuff out over the eons?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:05:08):**  I have a friend, Mike Huffman, who's very well known around the world for his work on  self-medication in primates.  And he's just done fascinating studies of the ability, how that works and so forth.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:05:26):**  But he talks about in some of what he's written, and he's worked a lot with indigenous peoples  in different parts of the world, and about how one of the ways they learned about medicinal  plants is by watching animals, wild animals that were sick, watching them and watching  
**[1:05:44-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:05:44):**  what they ate and then sampling, you know, trying some of that when they were in certain  kinds of sicknesses.  It's, that's, to me, that's just a fascinating, fascinating topic.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:05:58):**  I think that would be, I swear I'm kind of done writing papers and stuff, but I think  that would be worth a paper to try to get into how innovation and how that's all happened.  And I'm sure people have written papers.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:06:17):**  I think of those, there's a video I like to show of an oyster catcher.  It's down there, a body of water and has a piece of bread, throwing the bread, it's standing  on the shore, throws the bread in, grabs the bread, throws the bread in the water, grabs  
**[1:06:32-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:06:32):**  the bread, does it over and over again.  And you're watching that.  And then all of a sudden, wham, it got a fish, comes out, it gets a fish.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:06:40):**  It's fishing, it learned to fish.  So how did the oyster catcher learn to fish, you know?  It's a, those are...  
**[1:06:47-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:06:47):**  A fisherman?  Yeah, I don't know, you know, and that's where goats eating woodrat houses, you know, why  do goats eat woodrat houses?  
**[1:06:55-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:06:55):**  That was, I was so fortunate to be able to see some of those things happening down there  when we were working with the goats in Southern Utah.  We had six, in this first study, we had six pastures set up, 15 goats on each pasture,  
**[1:07:11-1:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:07:11):**  and goats in one pasture started to eat these woodrat houses.  And you know, I often tease people, well, maybe the Einstein of the goat world is in  that pasture and it figured out that, you know, if we eat these woodrat houses, but  
**[1:07:26-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:07:26):**  why were they doing that?  Inside those houses are different rooms.  And one of the rooms is the bathroom.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:07:32):**  And that bathroom is vegetation that's soaked in urine.  Well, that was a non-protein source of nitrogen.  And that's, if there's one thing that you could supplement with down there on that poor  
**[1:07:43-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:07:43):**  quality roughage, that poor quality shrub black brush, it would be provided with a protein  supplement to stimulate microbial populations in the room and to help them to better digest  that, that poor quality forage.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:07:57):**  And by golly, those goats, those goats over the three months we had them on there lost  way less weight than all the other goats and those other, you know, I can't say that they  gained a huge amount of weight.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:08:11):**  It's just that they, they fared far better than the goats that, that didn't do that.  And over three, three winters with 18 different groups of goats, that was the only group ever  figured that out.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:08:24):**  Now if we'd have wanted all the other goats to be doing that, we'd have just had to take  an experience, you know, the goats that had learned to do that, put them in the other  pastures like that.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:08:33):**  They'd have all been doing that.  And going back to the oystercatcher, I'm betting that other oystercatchers figured out how  to fish watching that oystercatcher fish.  
**[1:08:43-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:08:43):**  But I'm bouncing around, the fascinating topic that you raise of how, you know, how did,  how do creatures in general and humans in particular, how did we figure out all these  different things?  
**[1:09:01-1:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:09:01):**  And you know, all these secondary compounds that were historically in plants and serving  multiple, multiple functional roles for plants, that we ended up using fossil fuels to do  those roles, whether it's herbicides or pesticides or on and on.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:09:22):**  Plants were doing that.  Well, people historically figured out ways to cook plants, to work with plants that reduce  the concentrations of those compounds in plants.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:09:35):**  So that to me, that was like, you know, that was, that was really clever that they figured  out some of them, cassava, for instance, that could be outright toxic, they learned that,  you know, if you treat it with water and boil it and different things, that's our cooking  
**[1:09:53-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:09:53):**  can be so valuable, but that they figured ways to deal with those with those compounds  in plants, and to be able to use them.  How many people got sick before we figured out rhubarb?  
**[1:10:05-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:10:05):**  Yeah, exactly.  You know, that's exactly right.  Rhubarb is loaded with oxalates.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:10:11):**  I'm not, we need to get into all these different compounds that are in plants, but that's right.  That's exactly right.  So I have a question down here about eating plant-based protein.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:10:28):**  And I guess that kind of, that was kind of supposed to be rolled in there with that dialogue  about fake meat.  And what I'm, I guess where I'm going at with this is epigenetic changes, whether we're  
**[1:10:43-1:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:10:43):**  talking about people, cattle, sheep, goats, whatever.  You know, from generations of let's call it a high energy diet or a refined foods diet.  Are we heading for, I'll just come out and say it, are we heading for a wreck in our  
**[1:11:02-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:11:02):**  human genome because of what we've been eating, like the industrialized, westernized, standard  American diet?  Is that going to cause, could that cause some problems down the line for us as human beings  
**[1:11:15-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:11:15):**  epigenetically?  Yes, I think it already has.  I think the wrecks already here actually, you know, when you look at the statistics  
**[1:11:24-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:11:24):**  and I'm not trying to place shame or blame or anything else in that sense.  It's kind of just the luck of the draw, however you end up on some of this.  But you know, realizing that these kind of changes begin in utero early in life, if you're,  
**[1:11:47-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:11:47):**  there is really a rich human literature on these kinds of changes.  And mothers who put on excess weight during pregnancy, mothers who are obese when they're  pregnant, mothers who are eating these ultra processed diets, you know, their poor child's  
**[1:12:07-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:12:07):**  born already well on its way to metabolic syndrome and type two diabetes.  It's just, you know, it's the wreck is already here when you look at the statistics and when  you look at that, you know, I can't help but think when I was growing up and sometimes  
**[1:12:27-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:12:27):**  look at pictures of people back in those days, they were so skinny.  It's like they were emaciated.  Just look at it and you think, whoa.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:12:34):**  And then you think nowadays when you're in town or wherever you are and you think, oh  my gosh, we have just so gone down that other track.  Now the beauty of epigenetics is that it can change.  
**[1:12:48-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:12:48):**  These can be turned on and off and so, you know, if we get people off of the ultra processed  diets and back on to wholesome foods and that's where the regenerative movement and all this,  you know, the wholesome foods have to taste good, right?  
**[1:13:06-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:13:06):**  They have to be good for you.  You can't say that reviewing the literature on the human literature when I was writing  the book, it was so revealing and kind of humorous to, you know, all the ways they think  
**[1:13:20-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:13:20):**  of to try to make vegetables more tasty to young kids.  And the one way, you know, the one way that was never talked about, it's like, well, let's  get really good varieties and let's grow them on great soils and let's make stuff that,  
**[1:13:38-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:13:38):**  let's try to shop locally.  Because when you pick stuff and ship it, you know, you're losing a lot of the nutrient  density and phytochemical richness and in a way it's kind of how do we go back to the  
**[1:13:52-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:13:52):**  old ways in ways that can make us healthy.  And you think of the cost to society.  I deleted that from nourishment.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:02):**  When I was writing the book, I had a whole chapter about plant wisdom and then cost,  weaving that in with cost to society.  The costs are just enormous in terms of the monetary costs of obesity and diet related  
**[1:14:17-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:17):**  diseases.  It's an enormous cost that we're paying on all of that.  But that is the beauty of it.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:24):**  Well, that's okay.  We'll just have healthcare for all.  We'll just get healthcare for everybody.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:27):**  Right.  You know, which, and we know getting into those, boy, just break the system.  There's not enough money on the planet to deal with that.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:38):**  So it's kind of, and that's where I appreciate what you're doing, Brian, and that all this  kind of, you know, it's how do we get back?  How do we get back to some of those old ways of appreciating growing your own food, purchasing  
**[1:14:58-1:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:14:58):**  locally from people who are, you know, maybe you can't grow a cow or even your own eggs,  but trying to get local and trying to, if you can even grow a few things yourself.  Just I think all that is very health promoting.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:15:16):**  We have some chickens here, my wife's got some chickens and we're, it's a long story  and I really won't go down that rabbit hole, but we shouldn't have them in this subdivision.  We were able to work it then.  
**[1:15:31-1:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:15:31):**  So we've got, but they don't want them just free ranging across our property.  So we'll let them out a couple of times a day.  And when people from, who have no background in anything we're talking about are here and  
**[1:15:42-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:15:42):**  we say, you want to come with us and we turn the chicken, they love it.  They just, you know, you would think they'd be bored stiff, but they think it's cool just  watching those chickens go picking this and that.  
**[1:15:53-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:15:53):**  And then the grasshoppers, when they get out going after the grasshoppers and just kind  of, you know, it's kind of mesmerizing and fascinating for them to just to watch that.  And it makes me think, you know, that's something that's kind of deep inside of us, I think,  
**[1:16:08-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:16:08):**  in a way of, and they say it's relaxing, it's relaxing doing that.  And you think, yeah, you know, it is, it is just, and we've got two ducks.  That's a long story too that I won't go into, but here's the point I want to make, is those  
**[1:16:24-1:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:16:24):**  ducks, and I never realized this, they are so tuned into the sky, the slightest thing,  and it can be so minute, you can't say it, but when you see them tilt their head, you  know, there's gonna, there's something up there.  
**[1:16:39-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:16:39):**  And a lot of times it's an avian predator of one sort or another, or it could be a jet  that's so tiny, but it's, and the chicken, you know, so now...  The ducks are the early warning system for the chickens.  
**[1:16:51-1:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:16:51):**  They are!  The whale said, and the chickens watch the ducks, we watch the ducks, and the minute  they tilt, they never miss, they never ever miss.  
**[1:17:00-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:17:00):**  You may have a hard time to see it, but they never miss.  And if the ducks start to run, boy, the chickens are on the run too for shelter, and it's just,  I don't know, for me, that kind of stuff is fascinating.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:17:14):**  And then it goes, you know, and so we built them this palace, this chicken palace, and  we put a roost, a place in there for them to roost.  And it's so interesting to see how they decided that that roost isn't where they want to roost.  
**[1:17:28-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:17:28):**  They want to be in the rafters, you know, and so just...  Sounds about right.  Simple little things, but yeah, but it's about, you know, animals aren't machines, genes aren't  
**[1:17:38-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:17:38):**  destiny.  Creatures are figuring things out, but you have to take the time to slow down to just  watch them, whether it's cows out on your landscape, or sheep, or goats, or chickens,  
**[1:17:51-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:17:51):**  or oyster catchers figuring out how to fish, or whatever it is.  Creatures are clever.  Back not to beat it to death, but the fact that genes are being expressed, up and down  
**[1:18:06-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:18:06):**  regulated gives hope, because it's like it's not just ironclad into the genome that that's  it.  We're bound to be an obese species.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:18:16):**  No, we can change those things, you know, but that means changing the whole system.  And that's the, I think the power of that whole regenerative movement in terms of health  from the ground up, building health from the ground up.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:18:34):**  One of the strangest things about modern society is that we have poor people or people in poverty  that are obese, like never before has that condition existed in human history until just  maybe the last 20 years.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:18:52):**  That's right.  That's absolutely the case.  And you know, when I was in the human literature reading on those things, people, you know,  
**[1:18:59-1:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:18:59):**  because people often argue, well, you know, it costs less to buy ultra processed food.  But even in the short term, it costs you more, but in the long term, then as we're saying,  boy, the cost to all of us, society is all of us, the costs are absolutely enormous.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:19:18):**  But you'll see as you go further into nourishment, where I talk about some of those things and  some very interesting examples that some of the people that write about humans and study  humans have used to illustrate points about no, it's far more costly to be eating the  
**[1:19:37-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:19:37):**  ultra processed food on many, many levels.  But there again, too, you know, I'm thinking of one example with strawberry fruit Gushers,  strawberry fruit Gushers, which are basically sugar with with an artificial strawberry flavor,  
**[1:19:51-1:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:19:51):**  there's not a hint of sugar with sugar water inside.  That's the that's, that's it.  And there's not a hint of a strawberry in that.  
**[1:20:01-1:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:20:01):**  And they're talking then about about the difference in in nutritional quality and what you're  getting for those.  But again, I think of strawberries that we buy and a lot of times they just are so lacking  
**[1:20:12-1:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:20:12):**  in flavor compared to ones like we're growing growing here now that are coming on.  And it's that whole idea of how do we how do we raise food for people?  That seems like that's where the local becomes so important race food for people that's really  
**[1:20:30-1:20:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:20:30):**  nutrient dense, phytochemically rich, from the vegetables to the fruits to the meats  that we eat and really get people hooked on hooked on really good wholesome foods.  And then, you know, it was interesting to me to read in the anthropological literature  
**[1:20:50-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:20:50):**  about how back in the day, before a woman got pregnant, they really paid very close  attention to the diet she was on and the diet that the father was on the the father to be  was on before they ever conceived.  
**[1:21:06-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:06):**  And it's like, boy, those people knew they knew the importance of that in terms of they  didn't know epigenetics or any of that, you know, but they they they understood that that's  important.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:18):**  That's important to health.  And  they knew it.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:22):**  They just didn't have a word for it.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:25):**  And I think this this wholesome eating and stuff bodies knew that and people's knew that  and it became parts of parts of the culture.  I often think that in the little town of Salida, where I grew up, all those people that came  
**[1:21:40-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:40):**  over from Italy, the grandparents and great grandparents, they they still had those traditions.  They grew big gardens, they oftentimes had chickens.  They, many of them raise a pig and stuff and that they they they didn't let that go.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:21:56):**  They knew the value of really wholesome foods and growing them on rich soils.  But then when I think to my parents generation and then to my generation and on from that,  we really lost that as a part of cultures, those people took great pride.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:22:16):**  They could grow gardens.  That was amazing, you know, with short growing seasons and that and they they took great  pride in the gardens they grew and the animals they raised and so forth.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:22:28):**  You got any theories as to why we lost that knowledge or why we decided to forget or quit  practicing?  You know, it's a good question.  
**[1:22:37-1:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:22:37):**  Probably multiple, multiple, multiple causes on that.  I think, you know, I remember when the first fast food place opened up into little down  the slide.  
**[1:22:48-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:22:48):**  I mean, it's so common now, right?  You don't even think twice.  But there was a time when all that was just getting started.  
**[1:22:55-1:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:22:55):**  And I think I think the industrialization of the of all those processes and the things  like Mark talks about in the Dorito effect just gradually, gradually, gradually took  us away from away from raising our own foods.  
**[1:23:14-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:23:14):**  I think also, as Fred, you know, we thought that with all the modern technology and everything  that we would work less actually, right?  We wouldn't have to work as much.  
**[1:23:30-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:23:30):**  That was the promise, wasn't it?  That was the promise.  But now I think we're running so fast.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:23:36):**  And I often think, you know, both husband and wives end up needing to work to try to  make a living for the family.  And so those things really take a backseat then who has time at the end of the day to  
**[1:23:49-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:23:49):**  come home and tend your garden and cook a home cooked meal and so forth.  All that, I think, multiple factors have caused that to disappear over time.  And, you know, it happens incrementally.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:24:05):**  So nobody notices all of a sudden, you know, you've gone from here to your clear over here.  And how did we get here?  Like you're saying?  
**[1:24:12-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:24:12):**  I feel like we've been tricked into living on too high of an energy budget.  I agree with you, Brian.  I agree with you.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:24:21):**  And you know, when that struck me more than anything else was I got on the faculty at  Utah State back in 1981.  And we built a house.  
**[1:24:38-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:24:38):**  We didn't have a lot of money.  And so we, you know, we were, we didn't have anything extra.  We had two kids and we didn't have any extra money for certain.  
**[1:24:49-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:24:49):**  And so after we got this house built, I finished the basement, took the time to finish the  basement and I had a lot in that house.  We decided to move to Australia for a year.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:04):**  And we decided we'd sell the house.  You need to sell a house and all our belongings.  And the market dropped at that time.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:11):**  And so we got more than we owed on the house, but really took a hit in terms of all the  work that I'd done on that house after.  You didn't get the equity you thought you had.  
**[1:25:21-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:21):**  Yeah, I didn't get the equity.  And so we moved in.  We had six months before we left for Australia and we moved into a rental house that was  
**[1:25:31-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:31):**  really what I would consider kind of a dump, you know, compared to the house where it was  kind of a dump.  But I was in that house about two weeks, maybe a month at the most.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:46):**  And I thought, you know, I love this dump.  I freaking love this dump.  I don't have any worries about my big house payment anymore.  
**[1:25:55-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:25:55):**  My family's with me.  I thought I didn't own that house.  That house owned me.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:00):**  Absolutely that house owned me.  Then we moved to Australia into an even kind of a worse of a dump.  Old cast iron stove to cook on like it was in my grandmother's house and stuff.  
**[1:26:13-1:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:13):**  But after that year, you know, and we loved it.  We loved it.  And after that year we thought a lot about what you were saying.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:23):**  We're on this high energy budget, but we thought we don't need to do that.  So we bought a piece of ground, two and a half, three acres, whatever it was.  We were able to grow a steer and a couple of lambs, huge gardens, and we built a very  
**[1:26:40-1:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:40):**  modest house.  That was the case.  We thought, you know,  
**[1:26:43-1:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:43):**  Is that when we came back or was that in Australia?  When we came back.  Yeah, when we came back from Australia and we just thought, you know, it depends how  
**[1:26:51-1:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:26:51):**  fast you want to run.  If you want to run with the rats as fast as you can run on the high energy budget, just  keep buying all this materialistic stuff.  
**[1:27:02-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:27:02):**  Have a ton of cars, have big house, have all that stuff.  And boy, you'll, but we thought, no, we're done with that.  We paid that house off in 10 years.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:27:14):**  Right on.  Yeah.  So, you know, I'm not trying to sound like the big whatever, but I mean, it's just, it  
**[1:27:22-1:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:27:22):**  was a realization to us that, you know, you don't have to, you don't have to have big  of anything.  You can have modest, you can have, and not that the house that we built was big, but  
**[1:27:34-1:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:27:34):**  it's just, yeah, it's just, I totally agree with what you're saying.  We're on such a high energy budget and we have all these things that we just have to  have, right, that just keep you running so fast.  
**[1:27:49-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:27:49):**  And you know, and I think trying to raise a family nowadays too, with all the things  from cell phones to you name it, that the tyranny of the school activity calendar, I  think is what somebody put it once.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:28:07):**  Oh, absolutely.  You know, and then you're caught, you know, of how do you, how do you do that in a way  so your kids don't feel like you're abused.  
**[1:28:18-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:28:18):**  But you know, try to raise them in a way that not in these, not in these craziness.  Yeah, none of that leads to happiness.  That's the thing.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:28:29):**  None of that leads to happiness.  My somewhat controversial viewpoint on education is that's the parent's job.  And by delegating the raising and education of our children to the state, to the government,  
**[1:28:52-1:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:28:52):**  you know, people talk about homeschooling as an experiment.  And I think they have it completely backwards.  Homeschooling is not the experiment.  
**[1:28:59-1:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:28:59):**  Homeschooling has been going on for thousands of years under maybe different names.  But the experiment is government run schooling, and I don't think it's working.  You know, that's absolutely the case.  
**[1:29:13-1:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:29:13):**  It's the same kind of, same kind of story for the wisdom of the body, right?  That's what that education is going on forever in terms of how to live in an environment,  right?  
**[1:29:26-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:29:26):**  And it was the family and the extended families that we used to live in, that our ancestors  lived in, families, extended families, clans, and so forth.  And so yeah, that was, that's where the teaching was taking place.  
**[1:29:41-1:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:29:41):**  Well, hopefully as we go forward in time, we'll start rediscovering and reapplying that  generational and ancient wisdom.  And I hope we can do it before we get too far down this high energy path that we're  
**[1:29:57-1:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:29:57):**  on.  Yeah, that's what I often think about and wonder about.  I think that's exactly, hopefully that can happen.  
**[1:30:10-1:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:30:10):**  Yeah, absolutely the case.  You know, the other thing I think about a lot too is in that process of moving toward  the education in schools and so forth, we moved away from the hands-on part.  
**[1:30:30-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:30:30):**  Most people learn so much better with hands-on, the personal experience of something.  And I often think we had a program going the last 10 years I was at Utah State called Behave.  And we were, had many different kinds of activities, but one of them was working with kids in the

And then they'd go off for summer and then the fall, bringing them back and showing.  
**[1:31:06-1:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:31:06):**  But what a marvelous place.  You can teach everything there, huh?  You can get as detailed as you want, but it's real.  
**[1:31:13-1:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:31:13):**  And they loved it.  They loved getting out and they loved planting the seeds and talking about soil.  And you know, in this teaspoon of soil, there's a kajillion different, you know, microorganisms.  
**[1:31:25-1:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:31:25):**  But it, so you know, if you have the knowledge that you want to convey, whether it's at whatever  level, out in the real world is such a holistic way to do that.  It's really, and you could talk about all facets of systems when you're out there in  
**[1:31:49-1:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:31:49):**  out there on a landscape.  And it's to the degree that we've gotten away from that, I think we end up doing a disservice  to our species.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:01):**  I'd agree.  We got to kind of wrap this up, Fred.  Let me make one other comment on that.  
**[1:32:08-1:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:08):**  I agree.  And it ties back to with one other thing that you were saying.  I'm thinking of, and it's in the book, and it has to do, trying to think where it was,  
**[1:32:19-1:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:19):**  it doesn't matter where it was in Africa, but it was about indigenous peoples.  And the one group had stuck with the indigenous way.  So their knowledge of the 250 plants that were out there and all the different uses  
**[1:32:33-1:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:33):**  of those plants, not just in food and medicine, but in building and everything under the sun,  they had kept that.  Another tribe had lost that.  
**[1:32:42-1:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:42):**  The kids had become much more westernized.  And this extended drought, like 10-year drought, the tribe that had stuck with the old ways,  they weathered the drought really nicely.  
**[1:32:53-1:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:32:53):**  The other tribe didn't at all, because they'd let all that knowledge go.  They had lost that knowledge.  And the people who were writing about that said that the sad thing was the tribe that  
**[1:33:05-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:33:05):**  had kept that knowledge, their children now were becoming really enamored with the allure  of the western ways.  And it wasn't so interesting and so forth to be out there knowing all the plants and  
**[1:33:21-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:33:21):**  the animals and so forth and so on.  And so they were lamenting that they were going to lose that kind of knowledge as well.  And then when the next big drought hit or whatever, they were going to be in as sad  
**[1:33:36-1:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:33:36):**  a shape as the other tribes.  So anyway, that's kind of linking back with some of the things that you were saying.  And that knowledge, that knowledge of the environments.  
**[1:33:50-1:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:33:50):**  And I think often we're members of nature's communities.  What we do to them, we do to ourselves.  And by nurturing them, we nurture ourselves.  
**[1:34:00-1:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:00):**  But we've gotten so far away from that.  I think it's wonderful what you're doing to try to get people linked back in with that  kind of knowledge.  
**[1:34:11-1:34:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:11):**  Brian, I'll say as a kind of a last remark, I appreciate very much.  Well, thanks for that, Fred.  I think though a lot of what I'm doing is just helping connect folks like you with a  
**[1:34:25-1:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:25):**  wider audience and having some deeper conversation and getting people to ask questions.  That's what I want people to do.  Ask the frickin' questions.  
**[1:34:36-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:36):**  Maybe don't always come ask me all of them.  But there's a lot of important questions that we just don't ask as a society.  Oh, absolutely the case.  
**[1:34:48-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:48):**  And I think it's because at least in the topics that we were on today, we've become so detached  from that.  Who would even think to ask any of those questions?  
**[1:34:59-1:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:34:59):**  Also, if you can stimulate a little bit of thought and so forth, then that gets conversations  going.  And with all the challenges nowadays, ecologically, economically, socially, politically, some  
**[1:35:16-1:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:35:16):**  of that knowledge that comes from those farming and ranching and feed on the ground ways,  that's dang important.  I'm going to say one more thing.  
**[1:35:30-1:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:35:30):**  You know, when I was at Utah State, we used to have wonderful conversations in the undergrad  class that I was teaching about this, where we would dialogue about these kind of things.  And there's a movie I used to like to show titled Power of Community.  
**[1:35:46-1:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:35:46):**  And it was about Cuba.  And it was about what happened to Cuba when the Soviet Union collapsed.  And they felt Cuba was absolutely dependent on the Soviet Union for oil.  
**[1:36:00-1:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:36:00):**  And all of a sudden, there was none.  And they were an economy in freefall.  And it was an amazingly uplifting story about how people working together were able to,  
**[1:36:14-1:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:36:14):**  it didn't matter how educated you were, or whether, you know, how many PhDs or medical  degrees or whatever you had.  People became regenerative farmers in a hurry across that country.  
**[1:36:25-1:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:36:25):**  It's like, okay, now we're back to basics.  Now we're back to what really sustains you.  And it was great.  
**[1:36:38-1:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:36:38):**  It was a great story.  I think, do you talk about it, it sounds like it should be required reading for every US  citizen in the world in 2022.  
**[1:36:45-1:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:36:45):**  No, honestly, it is.  And it just showed, you know, it showed the power of people pulling together too, that  people actually faced with that challenge, they work together rather than pulling apart.  
**[1:37:01-1:37:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:01):**  But also, you know, no more fossil fuels.  So you couldn't rely on any of the things we rely on in industrial ag to do it, you  had to become regenerative.  
**[1:37:12-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:12):**  Absolutely.  And it was wonderful to show that and to talk about that and to say, you know, this could  happen.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:22):**  Don't think this can't happen here in this country or any country.  These kinds of things can happen.  And trying to get all of us thinking about, well, what would you do and how can we work  
**[1:37:35-1:37:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:35):**  together?  I'm thinking of the, there's a good quote at the beginning of the movie, The Big Short,  you know the movie I'm talking about?  
**[1:37:42-1:37:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:42):**  Oh, I love, love The Big Short.  I loved it.  So I think the quote is, the most dangerous thing isn't what you think you know is going  
**[1:37:52-1:37:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:52):**  to happen.  It's the thing that you know for certain can't or something to that effect.  Yes, like, no, I Yep, absolutely.  
**[1:37:59-1:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:37:59):**  And there's no way this will ever fail.  It's too big to fail.  It's too big to fail.  
**[1:38:04-1:38:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:38:04):**  Well, those are famous last words.  I think those are famous last words.  And it reminds me of a very short book titled Immoderate Greatness, Why Civilizations Fail.  
**[1:38:16-1:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:38:16):**  And that's absolutely it.  It's the hubris and you know I was exposed to some of that too as I went along in different  departments and stuff that were fabulous, you know, world famous.  
**[1:38:28-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:38:28):**  And you get thinking you're, you know, you get the hubris and thinking that you're too  big to fail or too good, you know, where that could never happen to us.  And boy, you're on your way here.  
**[1:38:41-1:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:38:41):**  You're way you know, it's just that that title is great.  Immoderate Greatness, Why Civilizations Fail.  Well, I'll make sure I get that in the show notes, along with every other book.  
**[1:38:53-1:39:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:38:53):**  And I think Ghost in Your Jeans, you said that was on Netflix.  It probably is.  I'm not sure it's a Nova special.  
**[1:39:01-1:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:01):**  I'll find it and make sure the link is in the show notes.  I tell you, that's, I don't know how many times I've watched that movie.  And it's as relevant today.  
**[1:39:12-1:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:12):**  It's been out, I don't know, maybe 15 years.  But it's as relevant today as ever.  And it's just gripping when you think about that.  
**[1:39:22-1:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:22):**  And they do a great job of explaining, you know, going more into and interviewing state  of the art researchers in those days.  And epigenetics influences every facet of our life.  
**[1:39:36-1:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:36):**  We were talking a little bit more about foods and those kind of things and diet related  issues.  But everything from how calm you are as an adult to, you know, probably any facet of  
**[1:39:49-1:39:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:49):**  personality you want to talk about all those things.  And they make that come alive.  They just make it come alive through all the examples they use.  
**[1:39:56-1:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:39:56):**  And it's focused on humans, of course.  So that makes it very, very interesting for people to watch and understand.  Great stuff.  
**[1:40:09-1:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:40:09):**  Fred, I really, really appreciate your time today.  I'm sorry about the confusion with the time zone.  I'll take, I'll own all of that.  
**[1:40:18-1:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:40:18):**  So don't worry about it.  No, you don't have to own it.  It's me.  
**[1:40:23-1:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:40:23):**  I'm old person.  And I look on the, when you brought that up and I look on the thing right there, it shows  two o'clock starting at two, but so much we had said three o'clock.  
**[1:40:34-1:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:40:34):**  So I'm thinking three, thinking three.  But you know what?  I've so enjoyed, honest to goodness, I'm sorry it took us so long to get to here, but I absolutely  
**[1:40:48-1:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:40:48):**  have relished our conversation today.  Great kind of, yeah, as we talked in Fort Worth, let's just let it go wherever it goes.  And I find that the most interesting where you don't come in with any kind of ideas or  
**[1:41:05-1:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:41:05):**  agenda, it just goes where it goes.  And I thoroughly enjoyed it, Brian.  Not just saying that to be nice either or whatever.  
**[1:41:13-1:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:41:13):**  I mean, it was wonderful, wonderful conversation.  I enjoyed you too, Fred.  And once again, thanks for joining me.  
**[1:41:22-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/70-Fred-Provenza-The-Flavor-of-the-Land-e1kc5le#t=1:41:22):**  Gang, y'all have a great week.

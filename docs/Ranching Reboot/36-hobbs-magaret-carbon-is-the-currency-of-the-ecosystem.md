**[0:00:34-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:00:34):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher back this week for a solo episode.  Our first two-time guest, not our first two-time recorder, that actually goes to Dallas Mount,  but I'm keeping that episode for later.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:04):**  It's aging well in the storage can.  So today we've got Hobbs Magare from Sisters Cattle Company.  Hobbs, buddy, it's been a while.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:12):**  How are you?  I'm doing well, my friend.  How are you doing?  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:15):**  I'm doing pretty good.  I'm glad that it's hoodie weather again.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:20):**  One of the benefits of being up here in the Pacific Northwest in the high desert is we  get to hit hoodie weather a little bit earlier than you.  I see you've adopted the regenerative grazier standard monastic clothing, which is the black  
**[0:01:36-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:36):**  hoodie.  Well, there's that and my brown pants, but I have a brown shirt on.  I've got the...  
**[0:01:45-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:45):**  Okay, so I'm brown and black.  I guess I'm not really black.  I do the black hoodie and the tan pants religiously.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:01:55):**  Maybe I can claim my invented tan pants because there was nobody wearing tan pants when I  started doing it, when I started wearing my brown pants, when I started wearing my Duluth  pants like seven or eight years ago, maybe a six.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:02:06):**  But it's practical.  I like all the pockets.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:02:10):**  That's wonderful.  And you got to do something to break out of the Wrangler mold, right?  And you know, I carry, you've probably never seen it in my TikToks, but I wear a pair of  
**[0:02:21-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:02:21):**  Leinz's pliers and a crescent wrench and a holster on my belt because I mean, just having  these two tools on my belt and the Leatherman in my waistband, that saves so many trips  back to the truck, so many trips back to the shop for a tool.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:02:42):**  A couple of weeks ago, I was up, I had to go turn on a water tank and I took the valve  operator with me, which is just a piece of two inch PVC with the slot cut out of one  end so you can reach down into the hole and turn the valve.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:02:55):**  So I was out there, I was messing around.  I got it on there and I got it as turn a valve and the valve is a little bit tight and it  just popped off.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:03):**  Shit.  You know, I'm two and a half miles away from headquarters.  It takes nine minutes to get there in the gator and there's two gates I had to open.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:15):**  But you know what?  I've got a Leatherman on my belt and it's got a saw on it that's pretty good.  So I just made a new one in about four minutes.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:21):**  Like I couldn't even have gotten to the shop to use the proper tool faster than I used  the Leatherman on the belt.  Did you just chop off part of the PVC and make a new slot?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:32):**  Yeah, I had to cut it off flush and then I had to make a new slot on both sides.  So it's like five cuts, but.  Ingenuity.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:40):**  Yeah, I got it done.  Got it done without having to go all the way back to the shop.  That's right.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:46):**  Time and money.  Yeah.  And that's, you know, getting things done with less and having everything you need to  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:52):**  get the job done.  That's kind of important.  And if you don't have everything done, as long as you can make do with what you got  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:03:57):**  and save an hour in your life.  That's the overall theme for our conversation, making do with less, getting it done with  less.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:04:05):**  I like it.  I like it.  So you've caught a little bit of hell lately on social media, haven't you?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:04:13):**  No comment.  I don't know.  What are you regarding to what are you speaking to specifically?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:04:23):**  Oh, well, I guess we don't really have to get we don't have to really get down into  the weeds too much until we get really controversial.  Some of the things you've shared with me I want to talk about is you said I've begun  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:04:37):**  to clearly realize that we're doing collapse ranching in regenerative disguise.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:45-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:04:45):**  I'm not sure I get that.  Well, I think I envision the human organism as one sort of loosely collective hive mind.  And I think that we as a population are sensing that an impending dramatic shift in resource  
**[0:05:08-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:05:08):**  availability is upon us.  And considering that, as you and many of your guests and I have discussed, the our current  agricultural system is so fossil fuel dependent, that any system that is going to survive beyond  
**[0:05:26-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:05:26):**  a massive drop in resource availability is in essence going to be collapse ranching.  And the regenerative disguise is sort of the the feel good sort of marketing wing of collapse  ranching.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:05:44):**  It's like, oh, we're taking care of the soil.  And it's like, well, actually, we're trying to not die when we don't have gas kind of.  Is it a race to the bottom?  
**[0:05:55-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:05:55):**  Like Mike Callicrate says, you know, everybody wants to be the last man standing the low  cost producer.  Is it a race to the bottom?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:06:05):**  Are some people in a race to the bottom that think they're doing regenerative?  I would say the more, this is interesting.  If you are in a race to the bottom, I believe that you are probably just sort of a linear  
**[0:06:20-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:06:20):**  evolution of industrial agriculture.  You're trying to just reduce your inputs, reduce your inputs, reduce your inputs.  But once agriculture undergoes a lateral evolution, that will be what I think is the real heart  
**[0:06:36-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:06:36):**  and solely animating principle of agriculture moving forward.  And it's not just the race to the bottom is built within the context of our existing economic  paradigm, which I think is probably on, you know, it's it's shakiest last legs.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:06:53):**  And considering, you know, the fact that 40 percent of every dollar that has been in existence  since 1789 or whatever has been printed in the last year, I think that's pretty good  indication that that we have some massive changes afoot.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:07:06):**  So if it's if you're if it's characterized simply as a race to the bottom, I think that's  still sort of chained within the old paradigm of thinking.  So yeah, I think that I think that most industrial producers or most producers with the goal  
**[0:07:26-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:07:26):**  of trying to reduce their costs as much as possible are certainly in a race to the bottom.  I don't I don't I don't relate to that personally in my own in my own.  I think maybe a race to the bottom is sort of the the the the cousin, the distant cousin  
**[0:07:43-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:07:43):**  of collapse of collapse ranching with a couple of different expectations about how the future  might be.  I don't know about you.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:07:54):**  I'm I'm I feel like I'm pretty doom and gloom right now about the future, honestly.  Well then you're a collapse rancher.  Yeah, I guess to some extent, you know what?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:08:10):**  There's a way out.  I mean, there's a way out, but it doesn't seem to be very popular.  Like the way out is is regenerative agriculture is is small community based agriculture and  
**[0:08:22-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:08:22):**  putting more people back on the farms and growing shit that people actually eat.  Right.  And it'll take in sort of the the issue that I think that we're touching on is what is  
**[0:08:33-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:08:33):**  the catalyst for that?  You cannot get people's the momentum of people's lives is completely unchangeable on a large  scale without some massive outside force.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:08:45):**  Right.  I mean, the dinosaurs didn't didn't go extinct and have a have a lateral evolution into birds,  allowing the rise of small mammals into basically what we have today without a massive asteroid  
**[0:08:59-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:08:59):**  hitting the earth.  And I think that that's what our agriculture in analogy, I think that's what our agriculture  industry is going to require in order for us to, you know, necessity is the mother of  
**[0:09:12-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:09:12):**  invention and we're going to require that outside impulse to give us the necessity to  return to that small scale.  Will there be a lot of death and starvation?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:09:24):**  Well, the the the the cadence of history seems to indicate that, yes, there probably will.  And that's and that's not you know, that that might be a controversial thing to get into.  And I certainly don't want to sound too much like a prepper.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:09:41):**  I don't think it's controversial at all.  I mean, I think you're absolutely right.  But it's also important to say, you know, if you want a better chance of living through  
**[0:09:51-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:09:51):**  that period in history, and you want a better chance of your, you know, your genetics and  your bloodline surviving, you get the hell out of the big city and learn how to grow  your own food.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:10:01):**  Right.  And that's I think that's one of the one of the really well cultivated, some of the really  well cultivated prepper people from that I've sort of read some tangentially, I'm not a  
**[0:10:14-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:10:14):**  particularly into that sub genre of of existence, but they are keenly aware that you have to  have a really great balance of self sufficiency and community integration.  Because the people who just put up the wall and fill the mode up with water and alligators,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:10:34):**  those people are just are toast over over time, but the people who are capable of bringing  something to the community and making themselves indispensable and invaluable are the people  who are going to be able to contribute the most in the long run.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:10:50):**  And those people are the ones who are going to be able to harness as you know, you and  I have discussed and many others harness the annual input of solar energy most effectively  without relying on the credit card of fossil fuels.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:11:07):**  If we can, you know, if we can figure out I mean, they've been they were doing it 150  years ago, the only the only problem is that the labor force has been reduced by 98 to  99% replaced by you know, john deere.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:11:19):**  At this point, you know, we were producing the same amount of food per person is just  that everybody was an agrarian.  And I think that we will probably be forced to go back that way.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:11:30):**  I don't I think most people who are alive today don't want to work that hard, that's  for sure.  And I think that, you know, we can kind of lead into, we kind of almost lead into a deeper  
**[0:11:40-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:11:40):**  discussion about geopolitics and, and economics of the carbon economy.  So and where I'm going with that is, I've been doing a lot of reading and research on  the carbon economies.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:11:56):**  And you know, I have I, I found there, there's three carbon quote indexes.  And I keep them on my phone.  So every day, I look on my phone, and I see what the price of carbon is on on three different  
**[0:12:10-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:12:10):**  major indexes.  Every article that I can get my hands on about carbon that's even going into economics, I  try to read and understand.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:12:24):**  So the thing that's troubling is at, I think it's like, if carbon is $100 a ton, you know,  a ton, it adds $1.  No, maybe it's like $50.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:12:38):**  It's somewhere in a 50 to $100 a ton range per carbon, it's going to add $1 to per gallon  of gasoline.  And like, you know, a year ago, diesel fuel was like, it was under two bucks, you know,  
**[0:12:53-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:12:53):**  life was good.  Everybody was happy.  And now it's, you know, 360, 363, I think it's like 380 here now, what is it out there?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:13:01):**  I'm about to say that I saw some pictures where it was like $7 in California, like,  even just trying to farm when when things are $4.  And there's a tipping point coming really soon.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:13:20):**  You know, inputs are all going up, natural gas is going up fuel is, you know, fuel is  $354 for farm diesel in most of the country, natural gas is going up, which means it's  going to be more expensive to use that irrigate next year, fertilizer is going to be more

You know, pharmaceuticals are going to get more expensive because natural gas and oil  are getting more expensive.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:13:47):**  I talked to one of my oil field friends today.  And he's like, man, I'd love to come help you out.  But boom's on.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:13:54):**  I said, yeah, I saw oil was 66.  And he said, yep, boom's on.  Everybody's wanting to go to work.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:13:59):**  And everybody's wanting to drill.  And I'm like, well, I'm happy for you.  I'm happy you're getting to work.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:14:03):**  But sure wish you come help me out on this little project I've got.  But anyway, same thing happened before the 2008 crash, by the way.  The oil prices started to approach a point that was really fantastic for the producers,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:14:19):**  but not affordable for the consumer.  And I've really begun thinking and I don't want to hijack your momentum here, but I've  really begun thinking about money in terms of money being the language of energy.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:14:34):**  Absolutely.  Money is a measure of stored energy.  Like I've been thinking about that for a long time, that money is just a representation  
**[0:14:44-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:14:44):**  of stored energy.  Right.  And it's you, by spending your dollar, are deciding how that energy should be used, both  
**[0:14:56-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:14:56):**  sort of retroactively and moving forward.  So where that energy shall be allocated and how it shall be used.  I mean, a lot of people think of the markets as the psychology of the human organism.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:15:15):**  And if that's the psychology of the human organism, then the individual dollar is the  language of energy.  And so it has some very interesting implications being that we continue to, since we've decoupled  
**[0:15:28-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:15:28):**  from anything that is finite, that we can...  The energy value ratio between an energy unit of petroleum, oil, versus a human unit of  energy or an animal unit of energy, that value ratio is just distorted beyond all recognition.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:15:52):**  And I say that and I bring that up, but sometimes I wonder if that even scans with most people.  I wonder if...  I mean, you get it right.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:16:01):**  Oh yeah.  I mean, I think about...  I certainly think about what are my daily activities?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:16:11):**  What would it take in terms of calories in, calorie out to get what I'm getting, to produce  what I'm producing?  I think that...  
**[0:16:22-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah, in terms of a conversation that's actually useful for the people listening, the thing  that I wonder about and then I like to ask people is if you could only afford half of  the fuel next year for your operation, would you stay in business?  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:16:45):**  And depending upon how fast the fuel prices rise, and it's like, okay, well, we'll be  able to pass on the cost to the consumer for a while, but at the end of the day, that's  not going to last very long because the chiropractor...  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:00):**  Commodity buyers not going to care.  What now?  The commodity buyer is not going to care.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:05):**  No, they're going to care that your costs have gone up.  Right.  I mean, absolutely.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:11):**  And a re-entry into the localized or the hyper localized or regional economy sort of eliminates  the commodity buyer to some degree.  And with a more centralized system, they are exempted from the social consequences of not  
**[0:17:32-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:32):**  caring about the fact that the prices have gone up.  People are really excited right now about the soybean prices over this last year.  I've never made more money.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:45):**  I keep hearing people say, it's just like, well, there's never been as much money as  there is now.  Money doesn't mean what it did 18 months ago, it seems.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:17:57):**  No, it definitely doesn't.  And the overall theme is that we very slowly, it's like the shifting baseline happens so  slowly.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:18:14):**  It just seems that it has some interesting implications about the evolution of the human  lifetime because the baseline of the really important things seem to shift just slightly  slower than our capacity to observe them.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:18:30):**  Like whether it's our pastures or whether it's the cost of various goods and services,  although that is really starting to test that theory now.  But we as human beings seem to have such amazingly short memories, which is why I think the humanities  
**[0:18:46-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:18:46):**  and history are so incredibly important because we have to look back and be able to try to  take that information and overlay it where we are currently.  And if you do that with any degree of reliability, you'll recognize that, okay, I think we're  
**[0:19:03-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:03):**  in some real trouble.  And so what do we do about that trouble and that we've come sort of full circle to where  our conversation started.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:15):**  So what do we do?  And what are you doing in your immediate life?  And what am I doing in my immediate life to make those changes?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:29):**  We have chickens.  I tried to grow a garden again this year.  It didn't turn out very good.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:33):**  I didn't grow a whole lot of corn.  Like I can tell you this, like if I was relying on corn to get me through the winter, I'd  probably starve.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:39):**  Glad I got a couple cows I can always take if I need to.  Well, and also, you don't need to, as I was saying, you don't need to be entirely self-sufficient.  There's a community around you.  
**[0:19:50-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:19:50):**  I mean, it's like, if you can provide, I mean, obviously there'll have to be some level of  balancing out.  You don't want everybody to be a beef producer in her community because you need people to  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:00):**  make shoes and stuff.  Make shoes, make nails, make lumber, things.  Those are all remarkably important.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:09):**  I mean, have you considered putting in a greenhouse?  I mean, ah shit, you don't even have time probably to put in a greenhouse.  We've been talking about it.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:19):**  She's actually got some plans.  She wants to put in a greenhouse.  We're really starting to sit down and plan out our garden for next year, but that garden  
**[0:20:28-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:28):**  plan is going to start kind of toward the end of November.  Did it just freeze too early on here?  Is the soil not working?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:37):**  We've had a frost.  We haven't had a killing freeze yet, and there isn't one in the near-term forecast for a  few days.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:46):**  But we did have a hard enough frost.  It killed a lot of the broadleafs out of the garden.  All the squash, cumber, melon, viney thingies, tomatoes.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:20:58):**  They've all quit.  The okra is still going.  Corn's a warm season crop, so it quit a month ago.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:21:09):**  But the cool season crops, they're doing good.  The carrots look good.  Radishes are doing good.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:21:15):**  Oh, there's one radish, man.  It looks like it's a baseball bat right underneath the leaves.  Oh, nice.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:21:22):**  I have no idea how long it is, but it's huge.  That's awesome.  Yeah, those brassicas are really kicking ass up here this year as well.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:21:33):**  I don't know what it is about this year.  One of the things that I've begun to think about a lot, and especially since my family  is leaving Oregon and going to a more year-round, graceful area, is that the American West pretty  
**[0:21:54-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:21:54):**  much exists because of irrigation and fossil fuels.  That is the only way that the population is able to be maintained in the American West.  Especially from the mountain ranges that are in the Cascades.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:22:18):**  All the way over to basically where the plains start.  At Amarillo, Texas, where I grew up, I guess Coronado went through there in 1512 or something  like that.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:22:35):**  It was the first time Europeans had ever seen hail, and they're like, there's no way human  beings can live here.  It's not possible.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:22:41):**  Well, lo and behold, we invented windmills and gasoline, and the race was on.  The reason I say that is now we're in the third really good year of drought here in  Central Oregon.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:22:59):**  My particular irrigation district did fine this year.  Some surrounding irrigation districts, they got cut off in June.  Madras, Oregon, which is a huge carrot seed producer, lots of hay, lots of alfalfa, they  
**[0:23:19-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:23:19):**  got cut off in June as the north district of the irrigation, the north unit of the irrigation  district.  They got cut off in June.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:23:32):**  What conversation do you think got the most amount of press that was happening?  It wasn't, we need to change our farming practices.  It wasn't, we need to recognize that potentially there are some changes in the climate, whether  
**[0:23:48-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:23:48):**  they're human caused or not.  The conversation is the government is stealing our water and giving it to the fish.  That's the conversation.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:23:57):**  No responsibility being taken there.  You need to let the river, the Deschutes River basically go dry so that we can irrigate our  pastures.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:24:09):**  That is just the most short term thinking.  If you look out on a long enough time horizon, I think the American West is kind of a losing  bet at this point in my dystopic opinion.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:24:26):**  I think that it's going to be really hard to exist here considering the lack of water  and the rising energy costs.  That's one of the reasons why our family decided to move from here in central Oregon in the  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:24:42):**  first of the year down to East Texas.  Yeah, it's going to be hot.  That's for sure.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:24:47):**  I was going to ask why you guys are moving.  Let's see.  Number one, super cold winters.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:24:58):**  They're not terrible here, but my parents are getting older.  It was a totally data driven decision.  Money, time, market more than anything.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:25:12):**  Money, look at what real estate values are in central Oregon versus what they are in  deep East Texas.  You would be shocked at what you can sell for and buy for.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:25:24):**  A real estate investment is only as good as your ability to divest from it at an opportune  time.  Building this business up over four years, proving it out, and then having a family conversation  
**[0:25:39-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:25:39):**  and going, you know that place that you wanted to retire in for the rest of your life?  Maybe if we sell it and then buy a fully functional cattle operation for what you can get your  basically retirement home for here in central Oregon, maybe that's a good idea because then  
**[0:25:57-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:25:57):**  you take a real estate investment here and then you turn it into an income producing  investment, which is generally a good idea, especially considering the landscape of changes  that are upon us.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:26:10):**  And then also time, I run all lease ground out here and I waste a lot of time and money  going from lease operation to lease operation.  And then obviously there are the politics of dealing with landowners and even if things  
**[0:26:24-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:26:24):**  are clearly laid out contractually, people still have needs and concerns and opinions  and ultimately being able to run your own operation with less friction is certainly  a good idea.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:26:36):**  And initially we looked at Eastern Oregon, we looked at Northern California, we even  looked at Missouri to some degree.  But the problem with Eastern Oregon, you didn't want to come be my neighbor?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:26:50):**  Oh, I would love to be your neighbor, Brian.  There's ranches for sale within an hour.  Well, yeah.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:26:57):**  And you know what?  I think you're one of those shining beacons of hope that for that area, and I'm going  to go be the shining beacon of hope or just somebody with a target on my back, it depends  
**[0:27:08-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:27:08):**  on what, but near Lufkin, Texas.  But also the reason, one of the reasons that we went to Lufkin is because it's within one  day shipping of four major Metro areas, Oklahoma city, Dallas, Austin, and Houston.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:27:31):**  Now I know that flies in the face of the whole energy conversation that we're having.  However, it's not going to die overnight and as, as, as we can, the proximity is still  relevant, right?  
**[0:27:44-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:27:44):**  You know, the proximity definitely is my sister's coming up to pick up the arrow bed.  The proximity is definitely still relevant.  And right now what the consumer wants and can still afford is, you know, a 25 pound  
**[0:28:02-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:02):**  box of beef delivered to their door.  And so I'm going to use that in order to build up the business, maybe eventually over time,  transition that into a more localized market, maybe a butcher shop or something of that,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:18):**  of that nature.  But, but do the best business that I can under the current business environment.  And then, you know, that puts us in a position to roll with the times, whatever, whatever  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:32):**  may happen.  But if, because if we're betting completely, I mean, before I even got back into the,  Can't bet completely on collapse.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:41):**  Can't completely on, on, on widespread systemic change.  I think anybody that does that as a fool.  Right.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:47):**  You know, so that's like, so you got to put yourself in a, in a, in a position to be as  nimble as possible.  So I mean, that's basically the reason that we and that's also why I don't have, you know,  
**[0:28:57-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:28:57):**  two years of, of dried foods stored in my basement.  So I haven't, I haven't bet completely on collapse, but I guess to your earlier point,  if you go ahead and look at your situation from the point of collapse, you will have  
**[0:29:14-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:29:14):**  already integrated the race to the bottom aspect while getting the philosophy right  as well.  Because if you, if you're just all like, I'm going to, I don't know, I'm going to slaughter  
**[0:29:28-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:29:28):**  all my beef and then put it in the freezer and then save it for, you know, for the incoming  problem that's going to happen in the next six months or whatever like that.  That's not going to happen.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:29:38):**  That's stupid.  Like stay in business, continue, continue doing that.  But the rancher who relies completely on taking their calves to the sale barn is a hundred  
**[0:29:51-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:29:51):**  percent exposed to any of the, any systemic shocks.  And so you don't want to be a hundred percent exposed to any of those things.  Obviously people want to, are going to want beef always.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:30:10):**  And so there is going to need to be to some degree, some centralized brokering system.  McDonald's and Burger King and Taco Bell.  They're not going to go away overnight either.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:30:20):**  No, no, not, not overnight.  Not at all.  But it's our responsibility.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:30:23):**  You know, just like we have short memories and we need to have long memories and also  long future horizons.  And so planning over the next 50 years, you know, it could, a small change over one year  
**[0:30:37-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:30:37):**  in one direction or the other, if it continues on that trajectory, it will be a massive difference  in 50 years.  So if you put yourself in a position where you can do well, regardless of whether those  
**[0:30:48-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:30:48):**  are, you know, regardless of the divergence, I'm sorry, I'm still getting over this cold.  Kicking my ass that long cold.  You don't have COVID do you?  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:00):**  No, I, we, well, I don't, I don't think so.  We, you know, we, our daughter got a COVID test when this sort of ran through the family  and it was COVID negative.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:07):**  You know, you can't rule out false positives, but I hope I did because then that means I  have natural immunity.  So you're not worried about it anyway, are you?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:15):**  Me, no, I'm a healthy young person and I also know that I'm not really afraid to die.  So that doesn't really bother me that much.  What about the community up there?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:25):**  Is everybody freaked out wearing masks and?  Yeah, well, central Oregon is becoming a, what you might consider a progressive hub  spillover from the Valley.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:37):**  And while there is still a significant conservative holdout, it is becoming much, much more progressive.  Because the only people who could live here and another part about central Oregon is it's  basically a West coast, rich people's playground, a playground of the decade.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:31:57):**  And so the people who can live here are the people who lived in Portland, San Francisco,  Los Angeles, and Seattle, who made all their money being engineers and software developers  and real estate brokers and fin financier's and things like that.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:32:10):**  And so those people are more tuned into the corporate culture, which by definition is  more in the what you might refer to as the woke population.  So so people are definitely really freaked out about it.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:32:22):**  And they don't they don't recognize that that the government uses any, any possible opportunity  to control people that they could get no matter what it is, if they can get you to respond  to something, then that will make then that is a control mechanism for them.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:32:43):**  The government's only bad when Republicans in charge.  Yeah, it's that.  Yeah, that's definitely interesting.  
**[0:32:49-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:32:49):**  I said, you're talking about, you know, woke and you know, been thinking about cancel culture  and like that, that Dave Chappelle thing, like, you know, he had that that close that  special the closer I haven't seen it yet.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:02):**  Apparently, it's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  That guy's a genius.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:07):**  But no, they were like, Dave, they're gonna cancel you.  They're gonna cancel you on Twitter.  And he goes, F that, I don't care.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:14):**  Twitter's not even a real place.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:19):**  It's remarkable, dude.  I mean, you and I experienced the same thing, particularly on TikTok.  It's just it allows the the nastiest part of people to come out and say things that,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:29):**  you know, you would never ever say in if you were together in a real place, because there  could actually be real social and physical consequences.  You know, that like that is the thing that keeps people civil is that they can get punched  
**[0:33:43-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:43):**  in the face.  You like I don't know.  I was just like, I get called like the other day in the span of 15 minutes, I got called  
**[0:33:53-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:33:53):**  a Democrat wannabe rancher and a conservative elitist within five minutes, you know, probably  on the same comment thread.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:02):**  Oh, yeah.  Same video.  So, you know, OK, you know, but I think that I think to some degree there is an unclassifiability  
**[0:34:09-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:09):**  about what you do and about what I do that renders people very confused.  They don't and they don't know where to put it in their brain.  So they automatically just classify it as the unknown, which is sort of immediately  
**[0:34:21-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:21):**  swept into the enemy territory.  And I understand that that's what's going on.  One of the directions I was kind of going, you know, you're talking about this woke West  
**[0:34:33-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:33):**  Coast culture and.  You know, they to them, nothing is binary, right?  Like you can't be a boy or girl like you might be somewhere in between.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:43):**  I mean, everything is a spectrum and nothing is is is a or b.  Why are they still lumping everybody into the left or right politically?  You know, when can we get rid of that binary?  
**[0:34:53-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:34:53):**  It's never going to happen.  I mean, ultimately, one of the you know, we've always been a tribal species.  And I don't know, this is this is the funny thing about.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:35:07):**  This is the funny thing about politics, I just think, you know, the the important stuff  is is nonpartisan.  It's the it's the it's the what you can and can't do.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:35:20):**  That's sort of around the fringes that are the so-called wedge issues, right?  It's like super like abortion, gun rights, vaccination.  Those are the wedge issues.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:35:30):**  And obviously, the covid vaccinations are the wedge issue of, you know, wedge issue  du jour, as you might say.  So it's definitely when are we going to stop classifying people on the left and left and  
**[0:35:43-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:35:43):**  right?  I mean, it's not going to happen because because we need these two groups to balance each other  out.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:35:55):**  In one group, the conservatives tend to be more rigid.  They tend to be more rooted in the past.  And they they and that tends to create a more stable environment, but also can can ossify  
**[0:36:11-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:36:11):**  into something that becomes tyrannical.  However, on the so there are good and bad aspects of it.  On the other side with the liberal aspect, we need people who are more free thinking,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:36:24):**  more open, who can push the limits of what we're kind of thinking of thinking how we  address reality.  However, if that goes too far, then we become untethered from any sort of stability.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:36:39):**  And if you if you if you start doing repairs on the boat too much in the middle of the  ocean, you know, it sinks, you know, so you need a counterbalance between these two.  And so the question that maybe we're asking is, when is it going to stop being weaponized?  
**[0:36:55-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:36:55):**  And I really just don't know the answer to that question.  I don't think it ever will.  You know, I think that probably the fact that there are so many people so connected on such  
**[0:37:06-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:37:06):**  a superficial level has created such an has created such a superficial conversation that  it has to be broken down into tiny little sound bites and 90 90 characters or however  much you can do on Twitter.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:37:20):**  And that's, that's some of the reasons that I love doing this podcast, you know, because  just 280 characters on Twitter, or, you know, seven minute segment on the news, it's not  enough to talk about some of these things and really unpack and nuance and really like  
**[0:37:37-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:37:37):**  examine an issue from all sides.  You know, and I don't have to fit into seven minutes.  I don't have an editor or producer stand over there telling me to shut up or tell me what  
**[0:37:49-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:37:49):**  I can and can't say, no, nobody's going to do that.  Then again, I'm also not going to poke the barrier and say, Hey, cancel culture, come  after me.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:37:59):**  But yeah, that's not what I'm doing.  What I'm saying, you know, I don't know what I'm saying.  How does the, how does the, the, there's one interesting thing about the whole left versus  
**[0:38:10-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:38:10):**  right continuum.  That's fascinating to me.  And it's that the localized aspect seems to be the localized agricultural aspect, reject  
**[0:38:23-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:38:23):**  localized regenerative market garden CSA aspect, which is probably closer to the future of  regional food security.  And commodity industrial agriculture seems to be dominated by the left, particularly  
**[0:38:43-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:38:43):**  in central Oregon.  This may not be the same way everywhere, but in, in central Oregon, the people who are  way more interested in connecting with the local community seem to be more on the liberal  
**[0:38:55-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:38:55):**  side of the spectrum.  And none of those people can ride a horse.  Which is, you know, as we discussed in the previous, in the first podcast we did, like,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:39:08):**  it's basically, you know, gardeners and people who walk their cows around like me, I'm one  of those people, you know, I understand that I, you know, I get my cows to follow me.  However, I also grew up in the traditional ranching community and can, you know, do all  
**[0:39:22-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:39:22):**  the cowboy shit.  I try to avoid it when I can, but I can do it.  And I think that the real problem with regional food security or food security with us as  
**[0:39:31-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:39:31):**  a nation is actually kind of is colored by that blue versus red conversation.  There has to be more, there has to be, and here's, here's a great example.  Like one of the reasons that my agriculture career has actually been able to be revived  
**[0:39:50-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:39:50):**  is because of a guy named Jim Wood, who's kind of adopted me.  He's has a vet degree from the University of Glasgow.  But he has a 40,000 acre ranch out in the Oregon desert, you know, and so he's, he's  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:40:05):**  a vet, but he's an operator.  You know, that's what he does.  He doesn't really practice veterinary.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:40:09):**  And he is the strangest combination of, of Portland punk rock and, you know, Vaquero  tradition and, you know, Scottish literature culture that I've been, and because of that,  he's just like the right down the middle centrist guy.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:40:31):**  And he is able to flow in and out of all of the communities, whether it's regenerative  or the commodity.  And that is one of the things that's made him so successful.  
**[0:40:41-0:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:40:41):**  And that's one of the things I try to model myself after as well, because I think that,  you know, like, agriculture has no has no political position.  The fact that it has been dissected and split apart is very somewhat troubling to me.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:41:04):**  And so I guess my question is, how do we bring those two parts together?  And obviously, I understand that my in the informedness on that particular subject is  my little part of the world.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:41:19):**  So the red hills of Kansas may be a different perspective.  I think people are kind of unwilling to accept that they might not be able to get a strawberry  banana smoothie in January.

I mean, I think people aren't necessarily willing to accept some sacrifices, you know,  not just for the betterment of their community, but the betterment of the whole world.  
**[0:41:47-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:41:47):**  You know, just thinking about the steep price, that all the miles that are typically on a  meal on an average American plate, it boggles the mind.  No, it does.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:42:05):**  The other day, I opened my cupboard.  And I saw all of the coffee cups I had in there, like 12 coffee cups, I was just disgusted  with myself.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:42:12):**  Just like, why in the fuck do I need 12 coffee cups?  Seriously, I need max to, you know, in case I break one, like, there's no reason for me  to have 1212 coffee cups.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:42:26):**  And this is actually informs, you know, I've been reading this book, as a result of sort  of this new realization about the monastic aspect of regenerative agriculture.  And called secluded times, a short history of monks and monasteries, basically in the  
**[0:42:47-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:42:47):**  Christian tradition, from the time shortly after Christ till now, in between listening  to country rap anyway.  And I think that that is one of, I mean, these guys just, they existed on nothing.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:43:05):**  They absolutely existed on nothing.  And we have gone so far from our original hunter gatherer ability to live in the seasons  and ultimately live without much at all, during certain times during probably a lot of the  
**[0:43:22-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:43:22):**  time to, as you said, having a strawberry, strawberry shaker, strawberry sundae in January,  or eating avocados in Washington State, you know, like, you know, this is that kind of  insane, insane behavior that doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:43:37):**  And I think that I think that what human beings need more than anything is to do less.  The stop wanting to like, like, there's one there's one quote that the Buddha has that  I that I like a lot, he says, you can know the whole world without leaving your front  
**[0:43:52-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:43:52):**  step.  And I think ranchers know this better than anybody, because the one thing ranchers don't  like to do, or avoid doing, probably because of consequences, but also probably because  
**[0:44:03-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:44:03):**  it's their nature is going on vacations.  You know, like, if you can go on a vacation once in a while for a little bit of respite,  that's nice.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:44:12):**  But  you just have to accept that there's gonna be some things messed up when you get home.  Like that's, you that's the reality of it.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:44:21):**  Like there's no such thing as going on vacation and coming home and everything being perfect  in the ranching business.  Like even if it's an overnight vacation, just expect something to be messed up.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:44:32):**  Yeah.  And that's why I believe that I believe in this is sort of my most recent.  I don't know other people have had this realization, but I'm trying to, you know, really trying  
**[0:44:41-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:44:41):**  to think it through that the regenerative operations are a sort of monastery, the new  monasteries.  And I've also for a long time, I thought that ranching itself is a particularly the cowboy  
**[0:45:04-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:45:04):**  Western ranching cowboy tradition is this odd sort of commingling of a monastic and  military existence because you're kind of by yourself a lot.  You're out there just looking quiet, you know, watching, watching the grass grow, who else  
**[0:45:22-0:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:45:22):**  watches the grass grow, right?  You know, not that many people watch the grass and also, but on the other hand, you have,  but cowboying itself is a martial art and that requires not necessarily, not necessarily  
**[0:45:35-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:45:35):**  you're not out there fighting horses and fighting cows, even though sometimes that is an aspect  of it.  You're controlling, you're, you know, you're, you're, you're mastering yourself.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:45:46):**  I mean, cause any great horseman or cattleman will tell you, you have to master yourself  right before you can master what, what's your relationship with that animal.  So it's an interesting combination of it's like, it's like, you know, the, the great  
**[0:45:59-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:45:59):**  ranchers are basically the Shaolin monks of the, of the North American West, you know?  And I think that, and I think that they also are more prepared to live with less.  Put my dark hood up.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:46:12):**  So I kind of get that aesthetic.  I like it.  You know, Bob Kinford, I was thinking Bob Kinford, he says, timing, feel, focus, and  
**[0:46:21-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:46:21):**  balance.  If you don't have timing, feel, focus, and balance, it, it, it shows when, as soon as  you get on the back of a horse and you know, it, it's the same when you're working cattle  
**[0:46:35-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:46:35):**  on foot, it's timing, feel, focus, and balance.  All things must balance.  You got to feel where that animal is a half a step at the wrong time.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:46:45):**  We'll make it, you know, and then animal will want to do something completely different.  I like your monastery analogy.  Like I dig it.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:46:55):**  Like I can almost see, you know, a head monk and then having some other, you know, like  subordinate monks and then some intern monks that actually go out and run the, you know,  run the reels and pick up the water, move the water or, you know, they're the ones that  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:47:07):**  are out there sleeping with the cows, keeping them in a herd.  I dig it.  Yeah, I think, I mean, I, and I, it's not too far fetched to think that that might be  
**[0:47:14-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:47:14):**  necessary moving forward.  And also it's, you know, it's a great preservation of knowledge and also there's one of the things  that's interesting about the history of monasticism is that they really brought a huge amount  
**[0:47:26-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:47:26):**  of knowledge about how to produce food to these areas that were referred to largely  as barbarians, you know?  And so they were great, you know, knowledge receptacles of food production.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:47:42):**  I mean, producing wine, producing beer, producing crops.  And I think that, you know, you know, we're, you know, we're into the end of the period  where I'm going to have a bunch of monk-like people moving, moving the cattle, however  
**[0:47:57-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:47:57):**  many times a day you decide is right for your operation, whatever, you know, and that is,  and the reason I started thinking about this is because I was talking to my mom the other  day about, you know, people are like, what, how do you have time to move your cows four  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:48:11):**  times a day?  Like, how do you, how do you have that time?  You know, and I always make time for it.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:48:19):**  And my mother said, well, that's because the type of work you do is very monk-like, very  much like a monk.  And it's like a meditation when you move your cows.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:48:29):**  It's like doing it so frequently.  And so that started me down this whole line of thinking and had me reading this book as  well.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:48:37):**  And I think that, you know, I think that there is, there, you know, monks have set times  for daily activities and I think ranches have, you know, and especially a regenerative ranch  where you, you know, move your cattle frequently have set times for daily activities.  
**[0:48:53-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:48:53):**  You know, I don't know exactly what the prayers that are prayed would be, but, but I think  outside of please be in, please be in.  That's just winter along the highway.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:49:04):**  Right.  So yeah, I think, you know, I'm glad you have an appreciation of that, of that monastic  aspect of the whole thing.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:49:13):**  Well, well, thanks.  It's it makes sense.  I'm not sure we'll ever, you know, like have like kind of that, the model that I have,  
**[0:49:24-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:49:24):**  like the vision I have in my head of, you know, about 30 guys in brown robes doing a  chant about, you know, the different species of grass or whatever.  And then, you know, some guys going out and herding them, herding them around on foot.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:49:36):**  It's a fun vision.  It might make a cool movie, but I don't, I don't see it happening, but  I mean, to some extent, like, you know, I think about operations,  
**[0:49:47-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:49:47):**  I won't name any names, but you know, some operations that, you know, kind of have a  master grazer that does, you know, that's kind of more moving on to consulting and stuff  now that has interns that come in that do, you know, that do the monitoring, do the,  
**[0:50:04-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:04):**  you know, clipping and weighing, moving the cows and running the reels and moving the  water and whatnot is, is that similar?  Absolutely.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:11):**  That's exactly what I was thinking.  And I was going to say, I was going to use basically a poly face as an example of that.  I think that probably what, what Joel Sal, Joel Salatin probably has one of the, you  
**[0:50:23-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:23):**  know OG examples of that because, I mean, he's a very spiritual guy anyway.  So it would make sense that his whole operation would, you know lean towards that.  And I think that there are going to be a lot more of those moving forward and, you know,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:41):**  grazing is getting just better.  I don't think Joel wears brown pants yet.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:47):**  Well, black hoodie and brown pants, man.  That's the, we got it going on.  So that's the official, that's the official dress.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:50:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're yeah.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:00):**  Black hoodie and brown pants, official dress of regenerative grazers everywhere.  You heard it here first y'all.  That's right.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:05):**  That's exactly right.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to get behind shorts, but you never know.  Maybe I can't do the shorts.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:13):**  Does somebody do shorts?  Does somebody move cows in their shorts?  Because Eastman wears shorts.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:18):**  Well, he's from South Africa.  Yeah.  I mean, I, and I was going to say, you know, like anybody outside of Australia, anybody  
**[0:51:25-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:25):**  in this country, go out and walk and move cows in shorts.  I don't, I don't know of anybody.  I don't know.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:33):**  I don't know of anybody.  I haven't seen that on social media yet.  Like I, I think most guys are still, you know, cowboy hats and Wranglers and boots.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:40):**  Like the super short shorts, like Daisy Duke cutoffs moving, you know, grass is going to  be pretty tall in Lufkin.  So that could be, that could be a probably about a kilt.  
**[0:51:52-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:51:52):**  Now we're talking.  I mean, I, I, if I did it, I'd get yelled at for cultural appropriation, appropriation.  That's the word.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:02):**  Yeah.  You probably would, but I don't know.  I think that we might be exempt.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:07):**  Yeah.  I'm sure you, you look, you look pretty Scottish to me, my friend.  Big red beard.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:12):**  You know, I could probably get away with it.  I think, I think you certainly could.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:17):**  I, what's, what's heading, what's, what's happening in your world over the winter?  Hey, I've been wanting to ask you about your Corianis.  How do they do it?  
**[0:52:26-0:52:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:26):**  How are the, how's the, that operation look?  They're doing good.  Breed up was equivalent to the Angus and Hartford.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:35):**  Hurt that we're co-mingled with calf crop looks really good.  My yearling heifers looking awesome.  The one steer that I retained he gained 2.8 pounds per day this summer.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:49):**  Wonderful.  I mean, from when we want to put the EIDs in May 7th, when we weighed him.  Oh, I don't know.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:52:56):**  I have to look when that was, but it was sometime back in the, back in September.  He gained 2.8 pounds a day.  That's wonderful.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:53:04):**  So I'll be getting him a slaughter date.  He goes in the, he goes in the freezer next year.  So right about this time, we'll be looking for a slaughter date for him.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:53:13):**  Well, you know, as far as breed up, I don't, I don't want to say the number, but it was,  it was not quite as great as we would have liked.  Tested the bulls is just, you know, my, my cows actually did a little bit better.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:53:30):**  Little bit better than his.  And he, he blames his on old cows and, you know, going through the records and looking  at what I got this brand, what's not well.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:53:38):**  Yeah.  That's mostly old cows, but, uh, you know, you're going to have that.  You're going to have a bunch of fallout with sale barn cows.

**[0:53:52-0:54:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:53:52):**  I got about half of them out of Texas and, um, where in Texas, what's out more lamb passes.  Okay.  So that's, that's like South and central or central South.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:02):**  I think, I don't know.  I haven't looked at a map, seen where it is.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:09):**  Interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:12):**  So I'm, I obviously I'm starting to think about, you know, what I'm going to do in terms  of genetics down in, uh, in Lufkin as well.  And I think it's going to be, it's always, it's always a, a, a wonderful opportunity,  
**[0:54:23-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:23):**  um, to be able to start right.  You know, I think in that area, you know, I think a beef master would do really, really  good in that area.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:34):**  Um, you know, I guess a couple of weeks ago, my friend, John Locke, he'd tell you, you  need to have some, uh, has some bus tourists in there because he'd want to sell you some  Brahma cattle.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:47):**  Yeah.  He's down.  Uh, I think they're just like South and West or West to Houston and a little bit South.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:54:54):**  Um, not real far from the coast and it's just, it's hot and humid.  But then again, you know, some of it's also going to depend on what your forage base is  going to be at, you know, if you're on native range or improved or planted pastures, you  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:07):**  know?  Yeah.  So it was funny when we went down there to look at the ranch, it was a really, really  
**[0:55:12-0:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:12):**  beautiful example of, does it have cows on it?  He did.  He has bring his cows in like a bunch of bulls that were hanging out in the bull pasture.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:21):**  But you didn't want to buy any of them.  We, you know, we tried to work it into the deal, but it, you know, it was just one of  those things that didn't quite work out.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:29):**  So, um, I've had a lot of people tell me so that like, if you want to go get great cows,  go buy the ranch they're standing on.  Right.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:39):**  Yeah.  I mean, that's, that's what we, we, we tried to, we tried, uh, to work that into the deal,  but it just, uh, that would have, it would have, I don't want to get into the details  
**[0:55:48-0:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:48):**  too much, but it would have pushed the price to, to a place that we didn't really want  to go.  So, um, ultimately we're going to have to, uh, we, we, we definitely have a plan to,  
**[0:55:58-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:55:58):**  to get to what we need going, how it, so it was interesting when we were there, the, the  bring his cows, they were a little bit large for my, uh, for my take.  Um, when I saw him there, it was interesting.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:56:09):**  Um, he, he, he clearly had, um, he clearly had them split into three groups, the, you  know, the heifers, the middle-aged and the old, um, and the, all the old cows had these,  um, you know, grayish calves.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:56:24):**  And so they were terminally crossed to a Charlet, which was what was my thought.  Um, then I, we got over to the bull pasture, bull pasture, and there's this really nice  studly looking Brangus bull standing right across the fence from the heifers, you know,  
**[0:56:38-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:56:38):**  um, just, and they were all with calves.  So it wasn't too excited about getting in there.  But then we got around the corner and there was a Charlet bull standing in the pond.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:56:49):**  So it was a pretty fantastic example of, you know, um, heat resistance or, uh, heat adaptation,  right.  Right.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:56:56):**  Staring us in the, uh, in the face.  So yeah, it would have, you know, we definitely made a play for those, for those cows, but,  uh, it was the, the, the guy was a pretty recalcitrant old feller and, uh,  
**[0:57:07-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:57:07):**  Probably thought they're worth a whole bunch more than you did.  They were, yeah, they were definitely, he was, uh, um, I think over time, I think that  we can, um, do something.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:57:17):**  I, I eventually would like to see an animal on our property.  That's about 50% Bostor, 50% Bostindicus, uh, you know, whether that is Brangus or,  uh, something like that.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:57:31):**  Um, obviously it's going to have to be half some sort of British, uh, based and then half  the, and then the Bostindicus is kind of the, the question mark.  I have some ideas, but, um, and Jaime and I have talked about it to some degree and  
**[0:57:46-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:57:46):**  you know, he definitely has his opinions about, um, what goes, and, you know, I, and I certainly  do, uh, graze more similarly to, to him than pretty much anybody else, uh, you know, down  from Ziedzmann.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:57:58):**  Um, it's been interesting to watch his, uh, his, um, descent into, uh, marketer, um, not  descent probably maybe a sense into a marketer consultant, uh, teacher, cause he's got, he's,  he's going into the whole online course world, which, you know, has its own, uh, variety  
**[0:58:22-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:58:22):**  of stuff, you know, like, Hey, let's do a masterclass and then I'll pitch you my course  at the end kind of thing.  So I'm glad to see him and he's, and he's, he's making a lot of, he's getting a lot of  
**[0:58:31-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:58:31):**  progress.  You know, I've been several years ago when I started doing what he's called total grazing  now, which I'm not sure I'm in love with the name, but I think it's a terrible name.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:58:43):**  Yeah.  Um, yeah, it's, uh, anyway, so when he, when I started doing that method several years  ago, you know, you couldn't find anybody who was doing it.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:58:55):**  Um, you could, you know, could not find anybody.  And, um, I think maybe you and I were the only people.  And at that point, um, Michael Kinsey hadn't even really switched over to it yet.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:08):**  And, um, but now people are doing that all over it.  When I, you know, I actually just jumped into his masterclass just to see it.  And there were two people from the panhandle of Texas, you know, on high news masterclass.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:17):**  And I was like, I did not see that coming.  Uh, so it's, so it's definitely, you know, it's the, the, the wave is here for, you know,  regenerative grazing and people.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:28):**  And I think a lot of people are involved in that, you know, I just want to make more money,  you know, um, I really want to make more money.  I want my cattle to do better.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:35):**  I want to be on a better nutritional plane.  I want to stop screwing my pastures over.  And, you know, everybody's really, really down with that now more so more so than ever.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:43):**  And I think it's the people who don't have massive ranches who are, who are really getting  into that more so than the folks who do it.  There's something to be said about the people that are managing their own ranch too.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=0:59:56):**  I think that, you know, the people that are managing their own ranch, like me and Mike  Kinsey, you know, it's easy for us to do this regenerative stuff.  We need to change infrastructure, get some water, move a fence.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:00:08):**  I don't have to go ask 53 landlords, you know, I just go, Oh, let's go move the fence.  And then I tell my labor unit, which is also me to go move the fence.  So it's a, it's, and that, you know, that's that hype.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:00:24):**  That's I mean, that's sort of a, another, uh, fractalization of that, um, hyper locality  thing.  I mean, it's, you have a, you're extremely decentralized, so you just, you know, you  
**[1:00:33-1:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:00:33):**  get to, you get to make it happen and you don't have to go up the chain of a vertically  integrated corporation or look, go look in the bylaws or the, uh, the, uh, standard operating  procedures.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:00:46):**  And, and also, I think, you know, there's a big difference, certainly what I'm seeing  out in the Oregon desert.  There's a, there's a big difference between the, um, as you just mentioned, the ranches  
**[1:00:56-1:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:00:56):**  that are owned and operated by an individual versus a massive corporation that, you know,  that sells cell phones or tires, you know,  Or Turner broadcasting.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:01:08):**  Right exactly.  I mean, that's, don't sue me, please.  Right.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:01:12):**  It's right.  It's just like, I mean, see that is, um, that's a fascinating aspect of view through the lens  of the language of money being the language of energy.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:01:24):**  Like you're capturing the, a huge, uh, swath of the economy, a tiny little piece of a huge  swath of the economy with, with, you know, with TV or cell phones or tires.  And then you just amalgamate that into a rainfall insurance and, um, tax shelter, you know,  
**[1:01:48-1:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:01:48):**  uh, I don't want to say scheme, but, you know, operation.  Um, and whereas, whereas an operation that is self-contained, you know, does not have  that, that access.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:02):**  And so, you know, as you were getting at those people are the ones who are forced to get  as much out of their land as they can, which means they have to utilize solar energy in  the most efficient manner because they don't have any access to any other part of the economy.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:21):**  And it goes back to the, uh, I mean, tangential I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll head that direction  in another little, go, go for it.  Oh, well, I just, and this is what I was.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:31):**  I've been thinking about, um, um, uh, as we were discussing via text the other day, I  really think that regenerative agriculture, even though I, I still, I still hate the name  regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:48):**  I just don't, I don't know.  I haven't been able to put my finger on it.  They think better yet.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:55):**  I agree.  I agree with that.  Totally.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:02:58):**  I agree with that totally.  A lot better than sustainable.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:03:01):**  I mean, I think we're trying all of the time and for some reason of this five syllable  word is, you know, sticks and it works and I don't know why, but it's just, and I think  it has mostly to do with, um, it, it feels like still just the redheaded stepchild of  
**[1:03:19-1:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:03:19):**  industrial agriculture instead of it being its own thing.  You know, it's in a way, agriculture should just be regenerative agriculture.  You know, just be, or, and you know what agriculture, because the big players are getting involved  
**[1:03:36-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:03:36):**  and they're trying to co-opt and greenwash the name and, and rewrite what it means.  I mean, and to, to, to some degree, uh, agriculture was split from the natural ecology because  it was, you know, it started as basically gardening and then it was just this one little  
**[1:03:55-1:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:03:55):**  outcrop and then it became this massive industrial centralized thing.  And then as we started trying to, uh, wind our way back into a naturalized ecologically  harmonious way of doing things, suddenly it just feels like we're, we're going full circle  
**[1:04:16-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:04:16):**  back into ecology.  That's, I mean, it's like, we're, it's just, uh, uh, it almost feels to me like we should  just be calling it ecology.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:04:25):**  Like when, when humans interact with the ecology, like we make food, like that's, that's kind  of, kind of what we do.  I mean, and in any other time that we interact with the, or we make, we, we make energy like  
**[1:04:38-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:04:38):**  harvesting timber.  So that's, you know, that's that, that is our, uh, um, harness of energy to some degree.  Um, we're harnessing, uh, solar energy to build our houses or to warm our, warm our  
**[1:04:50-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:04:50):**  houses or, you know, food or fruits or, or beef, you know, we're just harvest harvesting  energy and that's all that's what ecology does is, is energy harvesting and transfer.  And so the fact that we've split it out into this weird, um, thing that is, that feels  
**[1:05:10-1:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:05:10):**  separate, you know, it still feels like human beings are not, it still feels like human  beings are separated, even when you call it regenerative agriculture.  I don't know, this is kind of a stupid conversation to be having, but, uh, my, the, my, the,  
**[1:05:27-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:05:27):**  what I've been thinking about lately is that this is the very confused and, um, uh, chaotic  seed of a new religion as we were discussing the other day.  And that's the newest form of sun worship because we're going back to worshiping the  
**[1:05:44-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:05:44):**  sun through our activities of trying to utilize it as efficiently as we possibly can.  And in a way that honors it, like we don't want to, like, we waste so much sunlight,  you know, when you have bare ground, you're wasting sunlight, you're, you're, you're allowing  
**[1:06:00-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:06:00):**  the, you're not sufficiently honoring the miracle of, of, uh, photons.  And you know, we can get in, you're not sufficiently.  Applying the miracle, the, that solar energy really is by, um, by relying so much on inputs

And so in a way, I really believe that what we're calling regenerative agriculture is  the seed of a, of the newest form of sun worship.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:06:31):**  And I have to think that it's going to take me several years to think through this.  Um, so check back with me in a few years, but, and I might have a bit more cohesive  way to talk about this.  
**[1:06:41-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:06:41):**  But to me, you know, Christianity effectively died in, um, as a, as a centralized animating  principle for the Western world, right around, uh, right around world war one.  And then after that, it's been scientific materialism that, you know, uh, was exploded  
**[1:07:01-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:07:01):**  into, into existence, you know, with, um, probably with the nuclear bomb and then has  been, you know, dominating everything ever since, uh, you know, um, gosh, I, I can't,  I'm having trouble.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:07:14):**  Um, it might've been, it might've been Heisenberg.  I think it was Heisenberg who, uh, he said the first, the first, he only had two laws  of physics.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:07:28):**  The first one was the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, or I think that, I think that was  his first one.  The second one that never got any attention is Ottoman equals Brahman, you know?  
**[1:07:41-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:07:41):**  And so he was very, very steeped in the Vedic texts, which is like matter equals energy  in a way of, of, of saying that the, you know, the, uh, the whole is, um, is the, no, so  Brahman is, is, is the Ottoman is the man material.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:08:00):**  And then the, you know, Brahman is the whole, the immaterial, that thing, that unknown from  which everything Springs.  So what happened was the great scientists who gave rise to the, the material understanding  
**[1:08:12-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:08:12):**  of the world, um, had to do that from a place of deep sort of, uh, uh, spiritual or, or,  um, mystical understanding.  And then we ended up with this really great calculations and these formulas to be able  
**[1:08:31-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:08:31):**  to mess around with material.  And then the material itself became the dominating factor.  And so basically from, um, the end of world war one, and then the rise of, uh, particularly  
**[1:08:44-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:08:44):**  the United States through world war two and after world war two, we have scientific materialism  that is dominating the view of the world.  And that's, and it's also been associated with the rise of, of, of nihilistic, uh, atheism,  
**[1:09:00-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:00):**  um, which is that the world is industrial complex, the industrial food complex, industrial  pharma complex.  Right, right.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:10):**  Cause we're just a bunch of chemicals and atoms bumping up against each other, which  I don't believe at all.  And walking bag of microbes.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:16):**  Right, right.  Exactly.  Just, you know, but the, but this whole regenerative aspect is the seed of something new, in my  
**[1:09:24-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:24):**  opinion.  It's that thing that, that as we were talking earlier, the human, um, the human population  as a whole is one organism and it's, and it's feeling it's, it can detect that that scientific,  
**[1:09:40-1:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:40):**  uh, materialist view of the world is lacking and has just turned us into flesh robots,  which is totally wrong.  And it can detect that that's not working and it's dying and it's not making us happy  
**[1:09:54-1:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:09:54):**  or fulfilled or imbued with any degree of meaning or purpose.  And quite frankly fails as an, as a centralized animating principle for us as a species or  member of, uh, of, or, or a member of the, uh, natural community.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:10:13):**  So what is, what is trying to be born right now is this new animating principle, which  I think regenerative agriculture is one of its first expressions and sort of a new orientation.  And it's going to be fascinating to see what happens over the next 100 years to see, you  
**[1:10:31-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:10:31):**  know, and it, it, it might be that that regenerate, that, that vision you're having of the brown  rope monks, moving cows and, and moving the water and, and, uh, run and poly wire might  be closer to a reality than we initially think.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:10:47):**  Maybe it's not a brown robe.  Maybe it's like a cow hide robe or a Buffalo skin robe.  Cause that's all there cause there's no more cotton.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:10:58):**  Maybe you're right.  You're maybe you're right.  But, uh, uh, anyway, uh, you know, as many people have pointed out the, uh, the monasteries,  
**[1:11:07-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:11:07):**  um, kept some really great knowledge alive through the dark ages.  And if it is in, in the cards for us to go through another dark age, um, and collapse,  which if you follow the, the, um, exponential growth of human population inside any closed  
**[1:11:26-1:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:11:26):**  natural system, it falls off the cliff every time, every time.  And that's exactly what's that.  That's almost guaranteed to happen for us.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:11:36):**  And the resource consumption population model works with every species.  Like eventually there's a crash and you know, so are we, are we going to have a convergence  of empire collapse and, and resource scarcity is what is the resource scarcity going to  
**[1:11:57-1:12:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:11:57):**  bring about the last empire collapse?  Yeah.  For a long time.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:12:01):**  I mean, probably maybe in another several hundred, 300, 400 years, I don't know.  We might have a, see another, uh, coalescing of political powers into one centralized power.  But I think that, I think that decentralized, um, tribes is, is, is, is in our future.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:12:19):**  And that I'm not saying that we're going to be totally mad max.  I think there will probably still be some digital component of that.  You know, I think that our lives right now, our lives are in this industrial middle ground  
**[1:12:30-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:12:30):**  between, uh, agrarian and digital.  So it's agrarian, industrial, and then digital.  And so much of our existence lives right now in that industrial middle plane.  
**[1:12:44-1:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:12:44):**  But I think that we're going to see a divergence where most of where, where the vast majority  of our attention and our energy and resources goes to either a very analog agrarian pastoralist  agricultural aspect or a digital aspect, simply because of the computing power that, uh, and  
**[1:13:05-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:13:05):**  the efficiency that correctly done, uh, computing can, can, can create.  Um, okay.  Pause right there.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:13:17):**  So we're talking about money is the language of energy.  Carbon is a basic unit of life.  Carbon is also a basic unit of energy.  
**[1:13:27-1:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:13:27):**  You know, we, we talked earlier about, you know, the price of carbon.  I mean, like just, just in broad terms, uh, the California carbon index trades was trading  today at $25.  
**[1:13:41-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:13:41):**  It's been as low as 20 it's, I've seen it at 27.  It's usually right around 24 to 25 bucks.  That's dollars a ton.  
**[1:13:48-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:13:48):**  So at that, we're looking at, you know, that's 25 cents per gallon of gasoline, uh, as what  that adds to the price.  You know, we talked about the energy value ratios being so far distorted between the  
**[1:14:04-1:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:14:04):**  different forms of energy.  And then, you know, I, I just have a hard time wrapping my head around, you know, on  one hand, we've got, you know, folks in the government and pundits saying, everything's  
**[1:14:17-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:14:17):**  gotta be electric.  Everything's gotta be electric.  Everybody can drive electric cars.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:14:20):**  How are you going to mind all that crap?  Like the demand for fossil fuels and internal combustion engines.  It's not going to go away.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:14:32):**  Like we, we, it's not a switch we can turn off.  I mean, we could, but like, like you said, we're going to experience massive famines,  widespread starvation and extreme civil unrest.  
**[1:14:44-1:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:14:44):**  And the people in power are going to do everything they possibly can to hold on to as much power,  as long as they can at the expense of people like us.  And the way we make it through is the hyperlocal economy is a barter economy.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:01):**  It's it's relying on your friends and neighbors for goods and services and food and security  and not outsourcing that to a faceless government anymore.  That's right.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:16):**  And I think as you're, as you're hinting at, um, the, a hyper localized economy is by definition  an economy that does less.  I mean, part of the problem is we got to switch over to electric cars.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:30):**  What, so we can continue fucking driving all of these places that we don't need to go to  have all these jobs that we don't really need to have.  Let's have wind powered container ships so we can keep shipping fucking avocados across  
**[1:15:43-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:43):**  the, across an ocean.  So you can have your smoothie in January.  That's exactly right.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:48):**  Your avocado smoothie in January in Manitoba.  Yeah.  Avocado toast.  
**[1:15:53-1:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:53):**  Right.  Exactly.  And then, I mean, we're, we're just the only way through the, what is going to happen in  
**[1:15:59-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:15:59):**  the next hundred years is to do less.  We need to do less.  We need to spend less energy moving stuff around.  
**[1:16:07-1:16:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:16:07):**  And I mean, so much energy, there's so much, we have added so much entropy to the system,  just moving stuff around because we can in search of, of, um, pleasure in search of,  of variety in search of ease in search of comfort.  
**[1:16:25-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:16:25):**  Um, I think that that's one, you know, I think that's one of the things that bothers me so  much about, um, there's so much that bothers me about our current culture is that it is  so rooted in comfort and comfort is such a massively powerful motivator for people.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:16:43):**  They just want to be comfortable.  Like as long as they can have that aspect of their lives that requires them to, I mean,  and this goes back to the conversation about monkhood.  
**[1:16:52-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:16:52):**  Like these guys loved to suffer.  Like they want because they wanted to have such absolute control over their mind, body  and spirit that they would, that they, you know, St. Francis never slept on a bed.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:17:06):**  He slept on a floor on the floor his whole life.  And if you can get by sleeping on the floor and surviving with just bread and water for,  for weeks, like imagine, like, I need a soft bed, a pillow and a cheeseburger, man.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:17:22):**  That ain't me.  Right.  And I think that's the last though, just imagine what you would feel with, with, with, without,  
**[1:17:29-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:17:29):**  I mean, if any wonderful little thing, you know, came across defined by hardship and  struggle like that's overcoming adversity is one of the things that makes life interesting.  You know, I, I got a comment on one of my Tik TOK videos the other day, and it was somebody  
**[1:17:47-1:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:17:47):**  saying, Hey, how come every time you pop up on my four, you page, it's always something  messed up because my normal days are boring as shit.  Nobody cares about them.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:17:57):**  It's all, it's all good stuff goes sideways than anything's dramatic.  That's what the story is.  It's the, it's the story of, of struggle and the transformation that is, that is attained  
**[1:18:09-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:18:09):**  through struggle.  Like that's, I mean, here's, you might find this interesting the other day.  I have, I have some friends that are more acquaintances actually.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:18:17):**  And they have a ranch in Northern California.  And you know, they're dissatisfied with the market prices on cattle.  They're like, we're going to start a, you know, we're going to start a consortium where,  
**[1:18:28-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:18:28):**  you know, of people we, you know, like four of our friends, we're going to sell beef directly  to the consumer.  Like, so, you know, I want to have some marketing questions and I knew they were going to come  
**[1:18:38-1:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:18:38):**  in basically like, where do, like, where do I, like, what do I put it on Craigslist or  Facebook to advertise that I have beef?  And I was just like, I was like, you are not going to like the answer that I have for you  
**[1:18:50-1:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:18:50):**  about because there's like, okay, first thing you have to do, identify your market, right?  You identify your market and what does your market want?  It's not beef that your market wants.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:19:01):**  What your market wants is a story and what makes a good story.  It's suffering and transformation that comes through the, through the suffering.  So you have to provide your market with a story that involves suffering and transformation  
**[1:19:18-1:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:19:18):**  and comes out on the other end with a product that makes them feel good about themselves  and their purchasing of that product.  So my point is, if you keep doing exactly the same thing that you've been doing, like  
**[1:19:32-1:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:19:32):**  your conventional cow calf operation, except this time you just keep it and then get it  slaughtered yourself.  No one will give a fuck at all.  
**[1:19:44-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:19:44):**  And that is the bottom line.  So you have to say, you have to develop some way of changing.  I'm going to disagree with that.  
**[1:19:52-1:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:19:52):**  There's a lot of people, there's several people, not a lot, there's several, there's quite  a few people that I know in my area that are successful marketing, selling on Facebook,  still with grain finished cows.

They're not going to feedlot, picking one out and then taking it to the local locker  and having it broken down.  
**[1:20:13-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:20:13):**  They're taking one of theirs that they have grain fed at their house.  And having that broken down and selling that.  On a small scale, you can, you can do that and it should be done.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:20:25):**  You certainly should.  But if you want, there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with feeding grain to your cows.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:20:34):**  What I'm saying is that if you want to make yourself a player in a larger market and make  it make a real difference and do a large pivot, it has to be a, it has, you have to have a  story to tell people.  
**[1:20:51-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:20:51):**  I mean that, and that has to, and what I'm talking about is feeding hundreds of people.  That's what, that's what I'm talking about.  I mean, there are, there are tons of people here in central Oregon.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:01):**  There are, there are the cow per person capita is way high.  If you want to go find some finished beef, the only thing standing in your way is how  many slots are at the processor.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:12):**  That's the only choke point.  But what I would say is the thing that has allowed us to be successful, basically starting  from very little is the story of transformation.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:26):**  And so, you think of it.  And that goes back to not just doing something differently.  It's thinking differently.  
**[1:21:33-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:33):**  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  How come you didn't challenge me when I said there's nothing wrong with feeding cows grain?  
**[1:21:39-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:39):**  Because some people think that that's fine.  I mean, I'm not saying that I, you know, in the context, yeah, it's okay.  I'm not saying I necessarily, you know, would do that with my cows, but if you want to do  
**[1:21:54-1:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:21:54):**  that with your cows, that's okay.  I think, I think the problem with feeding grain to your cattle is, is that,  It's too high energy.  
**[1:22:04-1:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:04):**  I think it's, yeah, it's too high energy.  Their rumen is not designed for it, but most importantly, this whole conversation we've  been talking about it is it's built on, it's built on fossil fuels.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:13):**  It's not, it's not an honor.  It's it's, I don't want to say it's not honorable, but it's not, it's not utilizing the effective  use of solar energy by using, using fertilizer and fossil fuels to grow grain and then harvest  
**[1:22:27-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:27):**  it, put it on a truck.  And then, you know, inserting,  You've been a thing for 60 years.  
**[1:22:32-1:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:32):**  Right.  It's, it's a, it's a very new thing.  And I, I have, I have gained much more traction since I've given up on, given anybody, giving  
**[1:22:46-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:46):**  anybody any trouble at all about grain finishing cattle, because I believe that it's going  to go away on its own.  It'll be economics.  
**[1:22:55-1:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:22:55):**  It'll be input costs, economics.  And it, it'll go away.  It's like Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:23:03):**  Like they don't need to worry about banning CAFOs.  Like the way the economy is going, it's not going to be too many more years for $6 diesel  fuel and you know, a hundred percent increase in input costs makes $12 corn.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:23:16):**  That makes all the feedlots impractical.  Right.  And you know, what's a lot cheaper than that?  
**[1:23:21-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:23:21):**  Temporary posts and poly reels.  Like that's, it's a lot cheaper than buying fuel.  And ultimately I think people will enjoy their lives more probably once they can overcome  
**[1:23:31-1:23:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:23:31):**  that initial discomfort of, of transitioning into a sort of different, different style  of grazing.  And, you know, I, one of the things that we're doing, we're right back actually to the conversation  
**[1:23:44-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:23:44):**  about collapse ranching, because we know we'll figure it out as a, as a, as a species and  as a, as an industry, you know, as a result of what we're, of what we're doing of, of,  of the, of the input costs, but the people who will be at the position of maximum advantage  
**[1:24:01-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:24:01):**  are the people who've collapsed early and voluntarily.  And I think in a way that you and I have, you know, that just the and I think another  thing that comes back to this whole comfort conversation is that people would much rather  
**[1:24:18-1:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:24:18):**  let their cows graze in big pastures, then go out and move them so many times a day for  two reasons.  Number one, I don't, I think people don't like to walk that much.  
**[1:24:30-1:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:24:30):**  I think there's a part of, I think, or put out that much effort or build fence that much.  I don't think.  And number two, I think as a result of this whole fossil fuel experiment, people, when  
**[1:24:40-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:24:40):**  people say, how do you have, I don't, they say, I don't have time to move cows four times  a day.  What they're really saying is I have to be out driving a piece of equipment.  
**[1:24:49-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:24:49):**  Yeah.  I like, you don't have time to go move your cows even once a day, just once a day, if  you don't have time to consistently do that once a day, five days a week, not saying you  
**[1:25:01-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:01):**  can't sleep in on a weekend.  Y'all what do you do all day?  I mean, seriously, it takes me.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:11):**  I, if, if a cow move takes me an hour, if I can't get both herds moved in an hour, it's,  it's a long morning.  And I just got one of these herds 10 days ago.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:22):**  The other one's been here.  Well, they're my cows.  I bought them last year.  
**[1:25:26-1:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:26):**  I've had them, you know, for a year and a half program.  What was that?  How's the, how does the, uh, the, how does the training aspect of the new herds go for  
**[1:25:38-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:38):**  you?  It's pretty easy.  I mean, it's usually just a couple of days.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:46):**  I make sure I have, I've got, uh, some Cyclops energizers and they're hot and fast Taylor  Cyclops.  I think they're way hotter and way faster than anything else you can buy.  
**[1:25:58-1:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:25:58):**  And when I say faster, it's like time in between pulses.  Right.  And it's not just the first hit is hot.  
**[1:26:05-1:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:05):**  It's every hit after that is just as fast.  And it's just as hot with a Cyclops with something like a speed ride or a true test or any of  the other ones that are the same color with a different brand or different color with  
**[1:26:18-1:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:18):**  a different name on them.  They're slow and you might get a good hit that first one or two shocks, but by the time  it shocks a third time, it's powers going way down.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:29):**  Like I've been shocked by them enough.  There's a difference.  There's definitely a difference between five jewel energizers, like my two and a half jewel  
**[1:26:39-1:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:39):**  tailors hit harder than a three jewel, uh, speed, right?  I'll be darned.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:26:47-1:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:47):**  So, so, so what you're saying is if you have an appropriately, if you have a high end enough,  if you have a Cyclops, you can train them in the field.  You don't need to do it in the corral.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:26:59):**  Train and train them to hotwire in a corral.  What?  That's how I do all that out in pasture.  
**[1:27:04-1:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:04):**  But you know, I've also got five wire, you know, five wire barbed wire fences around  my perimeter, which you probably don't have.  So you know, if they get from one paddock to another across my electric fence, you know,  
**[1:27:17-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:17):**  in that first week, 10 days, it's just go out, open a gate, push them through, close  the gate, fix the fence.  Simple.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:24):**  Uh, but I, when I have that super hot energizer, like the problems just go, go away so much  faster, like three, four days versus two weeks on one of those speed rides.  Interesting.  
**[1:27:37-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:37):**  I like that.  Uh, and you know, one of the, one of my favorite parts about this, the style of grazing that  we do is that, you know, if they for, by some chance do get out of the poly wire, they're  
**[1:27:48-1:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:48):**  just so happy to be on the other side of the poly wire that they're never over there fucking  with the exterior fences.  Yeah.  
**[1:27:55-1:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:55):**  Yeah.  They don't go run away.  Like, yeah.  
**[1:27:58-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:27:58):**  That's, I mean, like the herd I had on says, do you see that Tik TOK?  Like I had a gate break and I had 200 cows out on the highway at seven 30 in the morning.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:07):**  I did see that.  I did see that.  Oh, that was horrible.  
**[1:28:10-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:10):**  Yeah.  I'm not saying, not saying my strip, graze, polywire cows wouldn't do that, but they'd  probably just, they might stay a little bit closer.  
**[1:28:18-1:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:18):**  Kind of reminds me of a meme I saw like, and I suppose it's worth mentioning because you  know, we're recording this on Thursday.  I'm releasing it on Monday.  
**[1:28:26-1:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:26):**  So this is getting right out.  It's corn stock season.  So y'all know the difference between one cow, calmly grazing on the wrong side of the hot  
**[1:28:34-1:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:34):**  wire and the ditch and 400 cows on the road going to the coffee shop.  One of those is a phone call.  One's a text message.  
**[1:28:40-1:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:40):**  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:43-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:43):**  That's fantastic.  Excellent.  You want to talk about fake meat today?  
**[1:28:53-1:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:53):**  What now?  You want to talk about fake meat today?  Sure.  
**[1:28:56-1:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:28:56):**  I'm happy.  I mean, it's all, it's all, everything that we talk about comes back to the same thing.  It's about the utilization and deployment of energy, right?  
**[1:29:05-1:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:05):**  Yeah.  No, I feel like the people that are eating fake meat, you know, I'm going to stop.  I kind of feel like I should stop talking against fake meat.  
**[1:29:14-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:14):**  Like if that's what you want to put in your body, if that's what, if that's what you want  to put in your body, go right ahead, please.  By all means go right ahead.  
**[1:29:24-1:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:24):**  Yeah.  I'm certainly, if you do the issue though, I don't really have an issue, but let's just,  let's just be real about it.  
**[1:29:31-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:31):**  I mean, it's.  If you want to eat it beyond burger, because you think it's better for the planet than  my grass-fed cow, go ahead.  
**[1:29:41-1:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:41):**  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, but, but yeah, I mean, and ultimately there's going to be no changing those people's  mind.  
**[1:29:47-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:47):**  I mean, and that's, that's part of the problem.  We are so locked in our, in our positions.  I mean, I am just blown away at the, you know, if you are skilled with words, you can somehow  
**[1:29:59-1:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:29:59):**  manage a way to get some degree of nuance in even a four line comment, but most people  are completely incapable of inserting any degree of nuance into anything that they say.  And which tends to indicate to me that they have no ability to understand nuance, which  
**[1:30:21-1:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:30:21):**  means that we really are speaking to a very, very narrow segment of the population that  have the ability to kind of pick things out.  Cause you have, you have the really thoughtful considerate people, which is a tiny percentage,  
**[1:30:33-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:30:33):**  and then you have the, so you're saying population, which is the rest of it, right now.  So you're saying that all cows are good for the planet.  It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.  
**[1:30:44-1:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:30:44):**  What I'm saying is cows raised appropriately are good for the, for the planet.  You know, it's like, you're like the amount of new.  And so these people are able to be pulled down.

**[1:31:09-1:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:09):**  and beat you severely.  That's right.  I've learned that the hard way on TikTok comments for sure.  
**[1:31:15-1:31:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:15):**  And you know, there's one, there's one burning motivation for Beyond Burger and it is people's  guilt.  That is the, and that motivation is actually the best thing that sells beef that I have  
**[1:31:34-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:34):**  found.  People's guilt.  That here's, there's a Shaquille O'Neal quote.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:39):**  He said, when I, when I was with Jeff Bezos one time, Shaquille O'Neal said this and he  said, he said, my entire investment strategy is about what changes people's life.  Right?  
**[1:31:50-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:50):**  And so I started thinking about the beef that we sell on the story that we tell along with  it.  And what is it about that that changes people's life?  
**[1:31:59-1:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:31:59):**  It's not that they're going to, I mean, you can go find a grass fed beef steak somewhere.  You can find a grain fed steak somewhere.  You can find good beef.  
**[1:32:05-1:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:32:05):**  You can find shitty beef.  You can find beef you can afford.  You can find expensive beef.  
**[1:32:10-1:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:32:10):**  But the reason that people always buy my beef and come back to it is not being, even though  they say this is the best beef I've ever had, this is what beef tastes like when I'm a kid.  I was like, I believe it.  
**[1:32:21-1:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:32:21):**  I'm sure you believe that.  But I believe that the number one thing motivating these people to buy the beef that I raise  is that it makes them feel less guilty about eating beef.  
**[1:32:35-1:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:32:35):**  And that is why people are eating beyond burgers is because they feel like they are actively  hurting the environment and hurting the climate by eating beef.  And if you're eating Harrison, you know, the Harris ranch, Harris ranch feed, feed me.  
**[1:32:52-1:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:32:52):**  Well, now, yeah, please don't sue me.  It's probably, it is possible in all probability that that is harder on the environment, according  to my opinion, in my opinion alone, then something that is grazed in its natural migratory, ecologically  
**[1:33:14-1:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:33:14):**  harmonious way.  And so if this is, this goes back to, and so if we are going to continue in the beef  industry, as you and I have known for a long time and discussed, we have to reclaim the  
**[1:33:25-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:33:25):**  moral high ground that is currently occupied by people who think eating lab grown meat  is better for the environment than eating beef that is, it is acting as a keystone species  and bringing all of the other tangential species around it into, into their natural ecological  
**[1:33:43-1:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:33:43):**  place.  And you know, the stuff they put in those beyond burgers, and I don't even know all  the names, just the, the, the, not meet the fake meat.  
**[1:34:00-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:00):**  Wonder how much of that crap they got from China, like some of their raw source ingredients  they had to get from China.  It's the, it's the electric car of food, right?  
**[1:34:10-1:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:10):**  Virtue signal.  It's virtue signal and it's built on a fossil fuel foundation and it somehow gives people  the illusion that they're doing something reasonable for the economy or the, I'm sorry,  
**[1:34:22-1:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:22):**  the ecology and for the climate and for the environment.  It's like, it's, it's a, it, right.  It's a virtue signal.  
**[1:34:31-1:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:31):**  Would you buy a Cybertruck?  Would you, would you, would you buy a Tesla Cybertruck?  Oh, you know, I probably, I would not be in that generation.  
**[1:34:41-1:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:41):**  Of people.  I, you know, it's like, it's like any surgical procedure.  You don't want to be the first one to get it.  
**[1:34:45-1:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:45):**  You don't want to be the last one to get it, you know?  So I'll wait.  Well, I'll wait to see how those turn out.  
**[1:34:54-1:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:34:54):**  Like, you know, for instance, like if you were, if you have a, uh, an operation with  a lot of elevation change, that would be a great application for that.  You know, you're going to live on top of a mountain with a solar and you've got solar  
**[1:35:07-1:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:07):**  panels, you charge on the way down.  That's exactly right.  You know, you're, you're, you know, every, every time you hit the break, you're charging  
**[1:35:14-1:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:14):**  that battery up.  So I think I'd get one.  I think I'd get one.  
**[1:35:18-1:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:18):**  Like, it doesn't make economic sense, but you know, if I had that much money lying around  or Elon wanted to give me one, I did give it a shot.  I think those Tesla trucks look pretty cool and, you know, five, 600 mile range on a charge.  
**[1:35:32-1:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:32):**  I think that might be enough.  The towing capacity though, it's going to have a hard time pulling a gooseneck full  of blood in a sale barn.  
**[1:35:39-1:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:39):**  Aren't they supposed to be able to pull quite a lot though?  I don't know.  I think they're rated to pull like 14,000 pounds, which that's not a trailer full of  
**[1:35:51-1:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:35:51):**  calves for me.  That's not a trailer full of calves.  I mean, that's, you know, 14,000 pounds is a light duty pickup.  
**[1:36:00-1:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:36:00):**  That won't haul my skid steer.  I don't, that won't haul calves to town.  That won't haul a horse trailer.  
**[1:36:06-1:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:36:06):**  You know, that might haul a little cargo trailer that might haul a boat to the lake, but that's  not going to work for me.  Yeah, it's good.  
**[1:36:14-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:36:14):**  You know, it's going to be interesting to see the energy usage and deployment in the  agriculture industry is just going to continue to be fascinating.  There is a company out there that's like building like class three, four, five, six chassis.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:36:41):**  And I talked to them and for something like we talked about it, I forget the numbers and  I go back and look at the email and tell you later, but like for something that would,  that would fit my mission, that I could get up, go to work, feed calves, you know, go  
**[1:36:56-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:36:56):**  out, feed cows with, then hook onto the trailer, go, you know, two hours to the sale barn and  come back without having to charge $150,000 was his ballpark of what that would cost.  And since money is the language of energy, what does that really say about how much energy  
**[1:37:22-1:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:37:22):**  is being saved?  Very little, like it, it makes a statement how much that value ratio is distorted, honestly.  And by that, you know, like we have to kind of unpack a little bit, like, you know, in  
**[1:37:37-1:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:37:37):**  order to get to electric cars, okay.  Like yeah, we had electric cars a hundred years ago.  I get that.  
**[1:37:46-1:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:37:46):**  They weren't very efficient.  Then again, neither were internal combustion engines back then.  Now we have fantastically efficient electric motors and electric systems and batteries,  
**[1:37:58-1:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:37:58):**  but they also require computers, which, you know, like I've never seen one made.  I've put one together from parts, which is kind of difficult to do in itself.  You know, it's probably easier now than it was, you know, get a date myself, like almost  
**[1:38:17-1:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:38:17):**  20 years ago, the first time I did it anyway, you know, all those components, like, you  know, the chip, the main chip, the graphic, and then the graphics chip.  Those things are so small and they require very, very tiny amounts of extremely rare  
**[1:38:34-1:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:38:34):**  things, gold and Iridium, Vanadium, you know, it's like rare earth elements.  Those are still being present microchips.  Like we still have to put those in.  
**[1:38:44-1:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:38:44):**  Yeah.  Every time they get a little bit better at making them, they make them a little smaller.  They use a little bit less, but then they just build more.  
**[1:38:49-1:39:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:38:49):**  So demand keeps going up.  You know, we can't have these fantastically efficient self-driving Teslas without a lot  of computers and those computers stand on a mountain, a literal mountain of raw materials  
**[1:39:01-1:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:39:01):**  mined only by fossil fuels.  Like you, there is no way you can replace that.  Like I, I cannot see a way in my head to replace the technology pyramid powered by fossil fuels  
**[1:39:14-1:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:39:14):**  that takes raw materials and makes a damn Tesla.  Like I can't see that electrified.  Well, that's because you see the, see the whole system as it, you know, this is why  
**[1:39:26-1:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:39:26):**  the wool can't be pulled over your eyes, Brian, as well as, as easily as most people, because  you're a systems thinker.  And that's, it's a, if you see, you know, was it John Muir said that in the walking  
**[1:39:38-1:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:39:38):**  in the woods one day, he's writing about walking in the woods one day, he's like, I, you know,  I try to pull out one piece of, you know, walking in the woods, I try to pull out one  piece and I immediately realized it's all hitched to hitch to the rest of it, you know,  
**[1:39:54-1:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:39:54):**  and that's, I mean, that's exactly what we're talking about.  I mean, it's just some, most people are content to stop one, one step beyond the initial thought,  you know, well, this leads to this leads to this leads to this leads to this is very,  
**[1:40:09-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:40:09):**  very exhausting for most people, but people like you are not, are not particularly exhausted  by that.  In fact, you thrive on it, and it energizes you to think that way.  
**[1:40:20-1:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:40:20):**  And most people are not that way.  And in getting to your con, your comment earlier about geo, the geopolitical implications of  energy, a huge amount of the chips that are in existence today are made in Taiwan.  
**[1:40:36-1:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:40:36):**  And we all know the how precarious Taiwan's geopolitical situation is right now.  And probably one of the things that is driving China's lust for it is TMSC, I think it's  called Taiwan, something semiconductor.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:40:56):**  I think they've, I think several years ago, they started moving a lot of their operations  to the Arizona desert, if I remember correctly, because of this exact reason.  And you know, a lot of the most of the Intel chips, I believe, actually are made in Oregon  
**[1:41:11-1:41:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:41:11):**  and Hillsborough, Oregon.  I think that's why one of the reasons why Oregon is doing somewhat well economically.  I just, I just read an article about this last night about, you know, Intel had shopped  
**[1:41:27-1:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:41:27):**  out a lot of their lower end chips to TMSC.  Interesting.  Yeah.  
**[1:41:32-1:41:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:41:32):**  And, you know, TMSC, you know, being in Taiwan, they got hit by COVID pretty early and they  shut down.  And those ripple effects are still being felt in semiconductor shortage.  
**[1:41:42-1:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:41:42):**  Like I was, it was probably June last year when I started hearing about like IT components,  networking components, instead of being available second or third day, being told, oh, maybe  a month, we're having a few snafus getting stuff.  
**[1:42:01-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:01):**  And that month turned into three months.  And now, like, I think we're all pretty well aware of the supply chain disruptions going  on.  
**[1:42:09-1:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:09):**  You know, everybody's seen the pictures of, you know, hundreds of ships stacked up port,  hanging out in the Pacific ocean, waiting to get into the port of LA to unload.  And Port of LA is full.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:22):**  Like it's full of containers.  It's full of boats.  Like the trucks coming in, like there's a line of trucks trying to come in to get stuff  
**[1:42:28-1:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:28):**  out.  Like it's like big as fragile, like Temple Grandin said, big as fragile.  And man, I, these, I, a year and a half ago when COVID started, I thought that maybe about  
**[1:42:45-1:42:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:45):**  now we would start with the supply chains would start evening out.  Like I thought the supply chains were going to be back to kind of normal about now a year  and a half ago.  
**[1:42:56-1:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:42:56):**  I really did.  I was wrong, apparently.  Yeah.  
**[1:43:02-1:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:43:02):**  It's, it'll be interesting to see how the whole thing plays out, but obviously what  it does is highlight the necessity for resilient, you know, resilient systems.  If you don't have any centralized systems have no redundancy built in and, you know,  
**[1:43:22-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:43:22):**  decentralized systems have a ton of, you know, the more redundancy, the more decentralized  system is, the more redundancy is built in.  And you know, the problem is redundancy is expensive from a, from a perspective of trying  
**[1:43:36-1:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:43:36):**  to amass wealth, trying to extract value from the system, hoard energy.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[1:43:46-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:43:46):**  Cause that's what wealth is.  I mean, it's just a hoard of, of, of stored energy that you can expend at will.  That's exactly right.  
**[1:43:53-1:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:43:53):**  That's exactly what it is.  And that is power.  And the interesting thing about the human psychology is that people would rather have  
**[1:44:01-1:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:44:01):**  that than use it.  They would rather, and, and that is interesting because that's what that's an abscess.  It's interesting in the, in the, in the human in the human organism, stored energy that  
**[1:44:17-1:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:44:17):**  is locked up and not able to go, go somewhere else is, is, I don't know, you might call  it inflammation.  You might call it an abscess, but it's like the energy that the energy is not flowing,  
**[1:44:30-1:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:44:30):**  you know, and, and, and the ecologies are very similar to economies, right?  And carbon is the carbon is the language.  Carbon is the money.  
**[1:44:41-1:44:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:44:41):**  It's funny.  Wow.  That's interesting.  
**[1:44:45-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:44:45):**  Money is the language of energy and carbon is the money of the ecosystem.  Let's say currency, the ecosystem is the currency.  The ecosystem and money is the language of energy, language of energy.  
**[1:45:01-1:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:01):**  Maybe we should hire a ghostwriter and write a book.  I like it.  I like it.  
**[1:45:07-1:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:07):**  That's good.  I mean, it's, that's right.  I mean, if, if carbon, if carbon slows down too much in, in an ecosystem, if it's a wet  
**[1:45:15-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:15):**  ecosystem, you get overgrown forest, right?  If it's a dry ecosystem, eventually it all burns away and then, and then it's gone, you  know?  
**[1:45:24-1:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:24):**  And if the carbon, I mean, that's why, that's why, um, planes, less dense, Savannah and  more dense Savannah properly managed are like, uh, are like economies where the velocity  of money is adequate.  
**[1:45:38-1:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:38):**  The velocity of carbon is adequate to keep all of the forms of life operating at a reasonable  efficiency and keeps everything alive because carbon is nothing but just like energy and  food for the next form of life.  
**[1:45:52-1:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:45:52):**  So if we keep that carbon cycling and all of its minions in the various nutrients and  L L elements and minerals, uh, going along with it, then we have this big, beautiful  machine of life known as the ecology that's operating well.  
**[1:46:06-1:46:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:06):**  And, you know, it's, so it's, it's so interesting.  All of that thought just came out of the idea that, that the rich people are hoarding energy.  That's, that's really interesting.  
**[1:46:17-1:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:17):**  I like that.  I like that a lot.  Yeah.  
**[1:46:20-1:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:20):**  It took us an hour and 45 minutes, but we're finally getting into some good stuff here,  Brian.  Yeah.  
**[1:46:26-1:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:26):**  Yeah.  And I only scheduled two hours.  That's good.  
**[1:46:32-1:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:32):**  I mean, and I think in these two conversations that we've had, I mean, I, I, I, I must admit  I've failed to, to listen to enough of your conversations with other people that, that  there seems to be a pervasive theme in the conversations that you and I have that really  
**[1:46:47-1:47:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:46:47):**  relates to, uh, carbon energy, solar energy, uh, efficiency.  Um, and just which, which, and I'm trying to, you know, through these two conversations  that we've had in this forum, I'm trying to sort of tease out what, what the thesis really  
**[1:47:04-1:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:47:04):**  is, you know?  Um, and, and, you know, ultimately it's, it's a central and that thesis, I really believe  which we have, which I necessarily haven't been able to tease out yet is at the heart  
**[1:47:16-1:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:47:16):**  of what this whole regenerative agriculture movement is.  You know, you can walk around or you can put up Instagram, um, posts all day saying we  have to help the soil.  
**[1:47:26-1:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:47:26):**  It's like, yeah, but what does that mean?  Like what are the larger implications of that?  And what is the, what is the common thread running through all of these conversations  
**[1:47:37-1:47:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:47:37):**  that points to the heart of a healthy existence?  You know, on the macro level, I'm just going to have to say calories.  Consumed for calories produced.  
**[1:47:50-1:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:47:50):**  I, and I got to give my dad credit for that one.  Like, cause he's been saying that one for over 20 years, calories produced, calories  consumed, like just, just try to wrap your head completely around that concept.  
**[1:48:05-1:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:48:05):**  I mean, you actually said it and you're the first person I've heard besides me and my  dad to really say calories consumed versus calories produced because at the end of the  day, like if we can't produce more calories than we are consuming in that production of  
**[1:48:24-1:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:48:24):**  those calories, we're not doing anything.  We're going backwards as a species rapidly.  Right.  
**[1:48:32-1:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:48:32):**  And I think, you know, to some, to some extent we are, you know, we are going like we are  going like face first into the crash at warp speed because we're ignoring these things  like the energy balance, you know, where we're using ancient stored fossil fuel energy to  
**[1:48:54-1:49:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:48:54):**  artificially sub to artificially supplement the available energy, the boost production  for more people.  And it enabled, you know, okay.  
**[1:49:11-1:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:49:11):**  And I don't want to talk that I don't want to like, like say I'm bad on oil or oil production  or, you know, modern technology.  It's it's wonderful.  
**[1:49:19-1:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:49:19):**  You know, modern medicine is great.  It's allowed us a lot of things, you know, like the internet is fantastic.  I had a rant about microchips, but you know, you're listening to this on a device that  
**[1:49:29-1:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:49:29):**  has a microchip in it.  Like it's just phenomenal to me sometimes to think like, even the power of this medium,  you know, you and I sitting here recording this on zoom, you're on the West coast.  
**[1:49:41-1:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:49:41):**  I'm in the middle of the country.  It's like, we're just been sitting here for last almost two hours, just having a conversation,  just two guys.  
**[1:49:50-1:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:49:50):**  This is going to go out to a whole bunch of people.  Like I almost a thousand is about what listens to us every that's about what we get listeners  wise.  
**[1:50:02-1:50:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:50:02):**  Like just that is possible with the technology and, and what all that technology is built  on it's mind boggling.  And sometimes I just have a hard way of imagining life without it or seeing how, how we can  
**[1:50:22-1:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:50:22):**  kind of survive and on a lower energy budget and maintain a technological standard of living.  Well, I mean, I think there's a profound amount of waste that's happening.  You know, we're, we're, we're using a huge amount of fossil fuels in ways that don't  
**[1:50:37-1:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:50:37):**  really need to use fossil fuels.  And I think that's maybe one of the things that's at the heart of regenerative agriculture  is like, this is not one of those things where we need to be spending that much fossil fuel.  
**[1:50:46-1:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:50:46):**  We could, you know, it's, it's naive to say we could easily shift it overnight, totally  naive to say that, but over the course of 10 to 20 years, we could reduce that need  a huge amount.  
**[1:50:59-1:51:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:50:59):**  If we really decided, if we came together as a culture behind you know, operating under  one animating principle, then we could dedicate that usage, that fossil fuel usage in its  reduced capacity to other things that allow us to maintain this connectedness.  
**[1:51:17-1:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:51:17):**  Like the connectedness that we have has, has yielded unbelievably beautiful things.  Like I don't want to give up cell phones, computers, the internet.  I think those are amazingly important for the, for the advancement of the human race.  
**[1:51:29-1:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:51:29):**  But I think that one of the things that came that has come with it is the, is the, the  just absolutely opulent use of fossil fuels in areas where it is completely not, where  it is completely unnecessary and in fact, counter productive to people's happiness and  
**[1:51:52-1:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:51:52):**  well meaning.  And I think that splinters out.  If you're using fossil fuels in an unnecessary way, that creates other jobs and industries  
**[1:52:00-1:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:52:00):**  that then that continue to use more fossil fuels in unnecessary ways.  And if we can just start to reign all of this stuff back in and go, okay, like, and this,  and then we get into the discussion of free markets versus centralized planning, which  
**[1:52:16-1:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:52:16):**  is its own mess, you know, which I guess we, that eventually, you know, leads to, we need  to, what will eventually prioritize the use of fossil fuels, hopefully will be, when that  moment comes, that, that we realize as a species that we cannot continue on the same path.  
**[1:52:40-1:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:52:40):**  I hope that we can come together and prioritize our use of the exit of the remaining high,  high density energy sources that we have for the betterment of everyone, instead of wasting  things.  
**[1:52:56-1:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:52:56):**  And, you know, maybe that's one of the things that, that drives this thought that I've been  having lately about a more monastic or mendicant existence for humanity, because we're, if  we're able to give up all of those trappings of fossil fuel, maybe we can truly dedicate  
**[1:53:16-1:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:53:16):**  the usage of it to the things that matter and, and make our lives better.  You know, I don't think, I don't think going to get coffee every morning at the coffee  shop is that important.  
**[1:53:28-1:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:53:28):**  I don't think, I think if you, if you go down the list of all of the jobs that people do  and how the population distribution into each of those jobs, I think most people are probably  doing work that is not really necessary, filtered through, filtered through the lens of the  
**[1:53:45-1:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:53:45):**  highest and best use of humanity.  And maybe that's just a, a, a, a, a,  I think like 90% of people have a useless job.  
**[1:53:54-1:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:53:54):**  That's probably, that's probably, and you know, maybe that's just an artifact of where  we are right now.  And maybe this is the alchemy that we have to go through in order to arrive at this higher  
**[1:54:04-1:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:54:04):**  position, this, this higher state of consciousness where we're utilizing the available energy  to us as effectively as we can.  Like there's no way to stop entropy.  
**[1:54:16-1:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:54:16):**  Like eventually the sun is going to turn into a white dwarf or whatever, and then, and,  you know, consume the planet earth.  Like that's going to happen, you know, and, and eventually we're going to introduce so  
**[1:54:28-1:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:54:28):**  much disorder into the system that all of that, that all of that is going to happen.  But our task is to slow it down as much as we possibly can.  The effective and organized use of energy is effectively the slowest is, is the lowest  
**[1:54:50-1:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:54:50):**  amount of entropy introduced into the system.  If you can lower the amount of entropy and stick and get as much of a, I, I'd have to  talk to a physicist about this, but because I have basic understanding of entropy would,  
**[1:55:03-1:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:03):**  would be that, you know, we don't need to have 32 and a half fossil fuel calories for  every calorie of beef that's produced.  That's not necessary.  
**[1:55:12-1:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:12):**  Like we can lower that.  We can still get one calorie of beef for a much lower cost.  And yes, that cost is probably always going to be slightly higher than what, what comes  
**[1:55:22-1:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:22):**  out because that's the nature of physics, but that discrepancy as what did you call  it?  The, the value energy value ratio, energy value ratio, the energy value ratio is so  
**[1:55:34-1:55:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:34):**  skewed that our responsibility is to get that down as close to even as possible, even knowing  that we'll never be able to get it down to one to one.  Like it it's the energy value ratio is so bad.  
**[1:55:49-1:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:49):**  Okay.  Like the analogy I like to use as a gallon of gas to an hour of labor.  So what's a gallon of gas in Oregon.  
**[1:55:57-1:56:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:55:57):**  I think we said it earlier, like, are you three and a half bucks?  Yeah.  Something like that.  
**[1:56:01-1:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:01):**  Yeah.  All right.  You want to hire somebody to work for an hour?  
**[1:56:04-1:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:04):**  What's it going to cost you right now?  It's going to cost you five gallons of gas probably.  So $15.  
**[1:56:09-1:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:09):**  Okay.  That one gallon of gas will take your, would take a vehicle X distance.  X distance is also equal to what it would take 500 people pushing that for an hour.  
**[1:56:26-1:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:26):**  Like 15 times 500.  I don't know.  I'm not real good at math.  
**[1:56:31-1:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:31):**  It's like kind of what, 750 bucks, 650 bucks, something like that.  Let's call $600.  $600 versus a $3 gallon of gas.  
**[1:56:39-1:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:39):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell me the energy value ratio is not out of whack.  
**[1:56:43-1:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:43):**  Right.  Yeah.  What were you doing?  
**[1:56:46-1:56:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:46):**  Let's see.  Obviously it was just like 15 times 500, right?  That's going to mean a 7,500 bucks.  
**[1:56:51-1:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:51):**  Yeah.  7,500 bucks.  Okay.  
**[1:56:54-1:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:56:54):**  I was off at zero.  7,500 bucks worth of human energy to replicate what three and a half dollars worth of gasoline  will do.  
**[1:57:02-1:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:57:02):**  Like, yeah.  The energy value ratio is way out of whack.  And ultimately, I mean, it requires us.

And I think that that's one of the things that I, one of my critiques of regenerative  agriculture itself is it's still just another transformation of that industrial scientific  
**[1:57:29-1:57:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:57:29):**  materialist way of looking at the world.  Because if you are able to look at this gallon of gas and go, oh my God, do we know, like,  can you believe what is contained in this?  
**[1:57:43-1:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:57:43):**  Like seriously?  Seriously.  This is a fucking miracle in this gallon of gasoline.  
**[1:57:50-1:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:57:50):**  If we were able to look at it that way, we would not be wasting it so much.  And we would not, and those of us who have an appreciation for it are still somehow locked  into systems that require us to use it to some degree.  
**[1:58:05-1:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:58:05):**  And that's why it's on us to get rid of that as much as we possibly can.  And that's why I say, like, I'm not a regenerative agrarian, or I'm not a regenerative rancher.  I'm a collapse rancher, or I'm a fossil fuel averse rancher.  
**[1:58:20-1:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:58:20):**  Like my whole goal is to get away from wasting, from being real, like, how inefficient are  we if we require $7,500 a gallon of gas to do one little thing?  You know, it's insane.  
**[1:58:40-1:59:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:58:40):**  And our values, it's interesting, the energy value system, the farther off the energy value  ratio becomes, the farther our value system as a species becomes, it seems to me.  For sure, and that's not fixed.  
**[1:59:00-1:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:59:00):**  Like on, like, and they're trying to fix it by increasing the price of human labor, relative  to the price of energy.  Like, because that's the only play, like, that's the only play that people in power  
**[1:59:11-1:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:59:11):**  have in order to stay in power.  They have to keep that value ratio distorted.  But eventually, like the music's going to stop and the price of oil is going to go up  
**[1:59:29-1:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:59:29):**  real fast.  And that's when the music stops.  And that's when things get really, really ugly.  
**[1:59:34-1:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:59:34):**  It's like, I mean, they're having to increase the speed of inflation.  And that's like, in order to stay in the same place, they're having to ride their bike faster  and faster and faster in order to stay in the same place.  
**[1:59:47-2:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=1:59:47):**  And when that happens, it starts to wobble.  And we're starting, we've been seeing it wobble pretty well since 2008.  And they've been doing everything they can to keep it stable, but they're running out  
**[2:00:00-2:00:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:00):**  of options to keep the bike stable, to keep the vehicle stable.  And the only way is to inflate our way out of it.  Processor's calling me.  
**[2:00:11-2:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:11):**  We've just blown past two hours.  Well, let's say, all right, well, let's table this conversation for, let's get another couple  of months of rumination and hit it again at some point.  
**[2:00:25-2:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:25):**  That sounds great, buddy.  Tell us again where we can find you on social media.  TikTok at Sisters Cattle Co. Instagram is the same, Sisters Cattle Co. I know there  
**[2:00:33-2:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:33):**  are more people on Instagram.  I just make TikTok videos and then shuttle them over to Instagram.  That's the easy way.  
**[2:00:39-2:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:39):**  Yeah, it's the easy way.  And I don't know, I'm on Facebook, but I never check the Facebook.  I'm sure I have lots of hate mail on Facebook I need to reply to.  
**[2:00:47-2:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:00:47):**  But anyway, yeah, TikTok is the best.  You can also visit the website, sisterscattleco.com.  And if you're in the central Oregon area, sorry, you've missed your last chance to get  
**[2:01:00-2:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:00):**  our beef probably.  And if you're in the Lufkin, Texas area or anywhere in the Houston, Austin, Dallas, Oklahoma  City corridor, look forward to seeing you.  
**[2:01:10-2:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:10):**  Are you going to stop by and see me on your way down?  That's a good idea.  I mean, I'm not on the way like by any, like I'm out of the way between.  
**[2:01:18-2:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:18):**  You're not that far out of the way.  It'll be a detour.  I mean, maybe.  
**[2:01:23-2:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:23):**  But yeah, that's a good idea.  I should do that.  Because I would imagine like that time of year, you're going to want to like just blast  
**[2:01:29-2:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:29):**  down the West Coast and then come across on like 10.  Yeah, that might be a good idea.  I do have a delete kit on my pickup, so that might be a problem going through California  
**[2:01:40-2:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:40):**  if I get pulled over.  Other than that, speaking of energy use.  Anyway.  
**[2:01:49-2:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:49):**  Mine's deleted too.  Right.  Okay, good.  
**[2:01:53-2:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:53):**  All right.  We're in the same boat.  All right, good.  
**[2:01:56-2:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:01:56):**  Yeah.  Well, I know that for one way or the other, we're going to get together here in the near  future.  
**[2:02:02-2:02:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:02:02):**  That's for sure.  Can't wait, buddy.  All right.  
**[2:02:05-2:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/36-Hobbs-Magaret-Carbon-is-the-Currency-of-the-Ecosystem-e198dof#t=2:02:05):**  It's been great today.  Thanks.  Wonderful.

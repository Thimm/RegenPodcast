This week's guest is a good friend of mine from up in the northwest part of Kansas.  He's extremely passionate about soil health and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:01):**  So buckle up and let's take a ride with my good friend Michael Thompson.  So Michael, how are you doing today?  Alright just got in from building some fence.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:10):**  It was pretty sticky outside.  We got just about enough to wet the concrete last night and across the state line in Nebraska  I got about a half inch.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:21):**  So I was up where we got half an inch.  It was just steamy.  It was pretty terrible building fence.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:25):**  So I'm not too bad about, you know, I wasn't too tore up about coming in at three to have  a nice cool drink and to sit here for a little while in the AC.  That's kind of why I've been scheduling these in the early afternoon, mid-afternoon, in  
**[0:01:42-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:42):**  the summer to give us all a nice, give us a break at least once a week.  We were just talking about the weather.  We had about 20 hundredths of rain here yesterday and it was, it wasn't even 85 when I was  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:01:53):**  headed back.  That's what my jeep said but when I got in I was just covered in sweat.  It's just hot and steamy and gross out there.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:01):**  So are you getting some rain?  Yeah, all in all we've been getting rain.  It hasn't been perfect but, you know, we've been front loaded.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:13):**  We got a lot of rain in May and June and July.  We've got just enough rains that we haven't hurt yet but with this heat and stuff we'll  be needing another rain or two I think before long because things are starting to go backwards  
**[0:02:26-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:26):**  a little bit.  So it'll be what it is.  We've got subsoil but the top foot or so, we've just used the grass and crops have really  
**[0:02:35-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:35):**  used that moisture in the top foot again so we're needing to get another inch or so to  really help us along.  I think we could all use rain.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:46):**  So tell us, I guess let's back up to kind of the beginning and let's tell a little bit  of the story of Michael.  Where you're from, where you're at now and how did you get A to B?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:02:59):**  Okay, it's kind of a winding road that I had.  It wasn't just a straight journey so far from the time I left high school to now.  Well I guess to start out I grew up on a farm in Norton County, Kansas which is four counties  
**[0:03:17-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:03:17):**  from the Colorado state line and we're right against Nebraska.  I'm literally two miles from the state line in Nebraska so we're up here in what is the  start of what they term Northwest Kansas.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:03:29):**  Growing up in Alameda, I was the son of a school teacher and a farmer and my dad was  a farmer.  He had a few cattle and stuff.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:03:36):**  He had a lot of pigs when we were growing up so we're pretty big in the pig farming.  So growing up that was kind of my duties to help him out with the pigs and we did a little  bit with the cattle.  
**[0:03:46-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:03:46):**  We only had probably about 25 head or so back then so we're pretty big into the pigs for  quite a while.  In the mid 90s, prices on pigs kind of went all to heck and we decided that it wasn't  
**[0:04:00-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:04:00):**  enough fun that we were going to lose money.  It was kind of the get big or get out and we decided that we didn't want to keep losing  money or working as hard as we were with the pigs.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:04:10):**  A lot of our facilities, we still did a lot of outdoor and dirt type hogs.  We didn't really have them in a lot of confinement.  We did have a furrowing in confinement but that was it and everything else was outside.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:04:21):**  All of our market hogs were and the like and all of our dry sows were outside.  It was kind of spend a lot on infrastructure or kind of get out.  So dad at the time, I was in high school and he saw that my brother and I were both probably  
**[0:04:34-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:04:34):**  going to leave within the five to seven time five to seven year time frame.  So he was going to be shorter on help anyway so we decided we just get totally out and  we sold the last hog in I think 1995 would have been the year we were totally out of  
**[0:04:50-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:04:50):**  hogs.  So by 1996, 97 was when I graduated and by 96, 97 it was pretty clear that mom was setting  me down and telling me don't come back to the farm or farm's not big enough.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:05:04):**  You know you're going to have to set out and find something else to do because farming  is probably not in the cards for you.  So ended up going to Votec.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:05:13):**  I was kind of convinced that I was in a really really smart class.  We had four valedictorians and I graduated second from the bottom of my class with a  3.8 so that's how it kind of tells you everything but where I graduated low in my class so to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:05:29):**  speak they said well you're probably more Votec material, you know college material  so not knowing any better I ended up going to Votec and I thought that you know I still  had the passion to farm so I got into diesel mechanics did that came back with intentions  
**[0:05:45-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:05:45):**  of working for a local dealer.  As things would have it I actually worked for a neighbor he started he needed a mechanic  but he also did water well drilling as well as farming so I got my kind of fix as being  
**[0:05:58-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:05:58):**  a hired man for a few years and doing a lot of water well drilling and learned a lot about  the water table and aquifers and geology and stuff from drilling these so that was kind  of a cool gig.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:06:09):**  Did that for a couple years then by some freak chance I happened to my mom worked at the  school and she asked me if I wanted to get a job as a paraprofessional helping this little  visually impaired child so I did that for a few years two years and then I had the superintendent  
**[0:06:29-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:06:29):**  of schools telling me I should go back and get my four-year degree and become a teacher  because he needed a they needed early ed teacher and then they were looking at getting a kindergarten  teacher so I went back and got my degree came back home to Almena where I grew up started  
**[0:06:45-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:06:45):**  working in the same district with my mother which was an interesting thing that my mother  was also my my colleague as well so that was kind of interesting but it was also an interesting  dynamic that a lot of the teachers that taught me I was now their colleague that was no longer  
**[0:06:59-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:06:59):**  their student so that was an interesting dynamic but it was fun because I knew a lot of the  staff I knew them well from from going through their classes and so it was kind of like a  homecoming the thing that it did give me was with the teaching schedule I had my weekends  
**[0:07:14-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:07:14):**  and my nights free so much to the chagrin of my mother I started farming I bought a  piece of ground there when I was finishing up with with college the very first year back  last year at college I bought the ground I closed on it and then I started started farming  
**[0:07:31-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:07:31):**  it so I did that for nights and weekends for about 11 years also got my master's degree  as a reading specialist I thought I was going to do title one reading in our school district  didn't end up doing that because I enjoyed teaching kindergarten that whole entire time  
**[0:07:47-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:07:47):**  so I taught kindergarten and did that but I have my weekends and my nights free so basically  with a little bit of ground that I had we really didn't have enough for me to be a full-time  farmer the dad was like well we do have enough grass and everything else that maybe you maybe  
**[0:08:06-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:08:06):**  you can run some more cattle so I started getting cattle we started just increasing  the herd just saving a lot of heifers and building the herd slowly and when was that  the farming I knew that the way we were farming with I guess you could call it kind of minimum  
**[0:08:21-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:08:21):**  till but we were still kind of a conventional till operation where we we do a really good  job of planting our row crops our corn and our milo at the time into wheat stubble but  then it was time to go back to wheat we'd go get the disc out we'd fallow and we'd do  
**[0:08:36-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:08:36):**  the disking and everything else and I knew that really wasn't working and that was kind  of a it was it was a high input labor wise but it was also high input with diesel and  fertilizer and and you know we still had a pretty big chemical bill too so I knew that  
**[0:08:49-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:08:49):**  wasn't working so I guess with the growing of or seeing that we could grow more cattle  on the operation we started doing a little bit of subdividing on our pastures and then  everything that was fallow we started putting crops in basically a lot of sorghum based  
**[0:09:06-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:09:06):**  crops in that summer time frame and still getting it back to wheat the wheat wasn't  like it was with summer fallow we did take a little bit of a yield hit but we were getting  a lot of you know we're getting a lot of bonuses of having that extra forage out there we first  
**[0:09:21-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:09:21):**  started just raising it as forage with a lot of hay and I'm not a one to run a sloth and  a baler that's one of the tasks that I really despise I still to this day if I don't have  to I don't but uh you know we did do a lot of bailing early on so it was starting to  
**[0:09:39-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:09:39):**  work and the fact that we had a living root a little bit more of the time but it really  wasn't working in the fact we were removing all that biomass off the top of the ground  so still in the fall our ground would be pretty hard when we go to drill wheat and stuff so  
**[0:09:50-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:09:50):**  we still have some of these problems so I guess that that's kind of where we are foray  into grazing and and we got into cover crops even more I was tired of hard ground and watching  we still had even though we went no till we still had a lot of ditching and when we get  
**[0:10:07-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:10:07):**  big rains would end up you know in the ponds or end up in the ditch or or it may huge ditches  that we'd have to go out and either push in with a blade or work in you know so we really  felt like our soils still weren't where they needed to be so that's kind of how we got  
**[0:10:21-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:10:21):**  into the diverse cover crops or diverse cover crops you know plugging that into our farming  operation so.  So it's interesting that you said you got out of pigs around 1994 because that was uh  
**[0:10:35-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:10:35):**  let's see I just started a high school around then and I was working for a neighboring farmer  and he had he had some pigs and I remember having to clean out the faring house one hot  June day and after that I really didn't like pigs very much anymore and the rest of the  
**[0:10:51-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:10:51):**  summer he complained about the price of hogs and then when I showed up for work the next  summer there were no more hogs that would have been that would have been that same exact  time frame.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:11:03):**  Yeah yeah there was there was a pretty mass exodus about that time frame a lot of guys  either they did build a lot more buildings and got into hogs pretty heavy or you know  some of the people that were you know medium-sized just decided that they'd get out you know  
**[0:11:18-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:11:18):**  it was one of those either get big or get out and there was a pretty mass exodus there  in the early 90s I've heard a lot I've talked to a lot of people from across you know Kansas  Nebraska even in Iowa a lot of those regions that kind of that kind of really was the time  
**[0:11:31-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:11:31):**  when a lot of the small hogs left the farm you know the smaller smaller hog operations  left the farm at that time period. So I guess the caveat of that is that freeing up that  you know freeing up that time we actually decided that instead of building the buildings  
**[0:11:46-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:11:46):**  you know using the money to build the buildings we actually went and got a loan to actually  buy a little bit more grass so I guess I wasn't real clear on that but we did get a little  bit more grass so that we could run a few more cattle because we really thought cattle  
**[0:11:58-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:11:58):**  was probably more to you know more suited to ours environment more suited with where  we were headed in the future. So we still do have a lot of good neighbors that they  went the route of getting into more hogs and so we've actually had the availability lately  
**[0:12:16-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:12:16):**  of using some of their hog manure as a nutrient source for some of our farm ground. So that  was kind of interesting on the soil health journey too about a carbon source and you  know it did kind of do some things that we it surprised us it was on some pretty poor  
**[0:12:32-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:12:32):**  ground that was pretty new to no-till that we took over that had a lot of plow pans a  lot of compaction layers in it and they did go out with a no-till coulter it was a coulter  type machine that injected it into the ground but it had a coulter in front a small injection  
**[0:12:48-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:12:48):**  blade in the back and really after they injected that we were still having a lot of ponding  and terrace channels and a lot of runoff in that ground and after we had that injected  that really has helped that we don't have the runoff that we had and it's actually helped  
**[0:13:04-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:13:04):**  a lot of the porosity of the ground the ground's got a lot more it looks a lot more like a  sponge now than it ever used to so I attribute that a little bit to getting more mic you  know getting a getting a source in there for microbial activity and then also the other  
**[0:13:18-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:13:18):**  side of things is getting a you know getting a carbon source in there that you know kind  of kind of helped hold the ground hold the ground more porous and get a little more airflow  into our soils too so the crops it's just our first year we're into it but our our corn  
**[0:13:35-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:13:35):**  crop after this looks pretty fantastic so it's been a been a pretty good system you  know so.  So we're I'd kind of like to back up and say and ask you how you got started down the path  
**[0:13:47-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:13:47):**  of soil health and regenerative agriculture because it sounds like you know I know you're  kind of one of the pioneers especially in your area with incorporating cover crops and  grazing and bringing bringing cattle back into a cropping system and so it kind of almost

**[0:14:16-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:14:16):**  Well I guess that all kind of dates back to when I had the talk with with mom it was pretty  much the talk with mom dad really I don't think had the heart to tell me one way or  another you know that that I couldn't come back to the farm he really wanted me back  
**[0:14:29-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:14:29):**  but he knew that it probably wasn't gonna work so mom was the one that kind of broke  it to me and I think she even broke it to my brother I'm not a hundred percent sure  if they ever had that talk too but anyway that we weren't that farming wasn't in our  
**[0:14:42-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:14:42):**  future so I guess that's though that was kind of I guess looking back on it if I can look  back at my 18 year old self that was probably the first you know kind of wake-up call that  I needed to do something different than what we were doing on our farm that you know I'm  
**[0:14:57-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:14:57):**  not gonna say we weren't profitable we always got our bills paid we always had some left  over but you know land loans if we ever had a land loan or any kind of any kind of loan  it usually took the full full time period to pay it off we weren't ever ahead we were  
**[0:15:13-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:15:13):**  just paying the you know paying it off a little bit at a time we had decent equipment we didn't  have brand new equipment you know just a lot of things that that we just were struggling  I mean we weren't struggling struggling but we were doing as good as we could have and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:15:30):**  I guess that was the first thing that I kind of started knowing that if I wanted a place  on the farm I was gonna have to figure out how soil worked you know I was gonna so I  guess that that's where it kind of all fell together where I got back into college and  
**[0:15:45-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:15:45):**  everything I couldn't I didn't take the agronomy route I took the took that teaching route  so I did hang out with a lot of people that were farming people or that came from a farming  background and also working for a lot of other people coming up through junior high and high  
**[0:16:01-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:16:01):**  school I saw a lot of different ways of farming and kind of was experienced into kind of more  of a continuous no-till type of farming the only thing that was really holding us back  at that point was back in that time frame in high school from going no-till was that  
**[0:16:16-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:16:16):**  we didn't have a good enough drill and we didn't have a good sprayer so those two things  and you know that just held us back and I guess that that's the very first thing that  we started doing was I started reading about the soil and how the soil was actually functioning  
**[0:16:31-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:16:31):**  a lot of early early early works you know about what the country looked like before  it was totally broken you know before it was broke out and farmed before it was fully settled  a lot of those late 1880s 1890s 1900s type of accounts of first settlements of our counties  
**[0:16:51-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:16:51):**  of Furness County Nebraska and Norton County Kansas and you started reading about these  settlers and they were talking about what I knew as dry creek beds and these weren't  dry creek beds they were actually full flowing water that they were building grist mills  
**[0:17:06-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:17:06):**  and they were building you know they were building grist mills on them they were building  all sorts of mills for milling lumber those kinds of things I knew if that was happening  they were actually flowing water year-round and they talked about how they were decent  
**[0:17:22-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:17:22):**  water sources to water cattle out of or that you know the wildlife would have you know  these these ponds these puddles to water out of and they'd have flowing water in these  now dry creeks they'd also talk about you know rainfalls and things like that you start  
**[0:17:39-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:17:39):**  seeing a totally different account of what they experienced versus what I was experiencing  you know say 80 90 100 years into you know us breaking the prairie up and farming it  and overgrazing pastures and I guess that I kind of knew that soil was more capable  
**[0:17:57-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:17:57):**  than what we gave it credit for of you know that it could hold more moisture that maybe  we could do a little bit better for our ground than what we currently were. Basically I just  was sick of watching it wash away all the time you know that was growing up that was  
**[0:18:12-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:18:12):**  one of my jobs eight years old I was stuck in a four-wheel drive tractor and the four-wheel  drive was was my job was to go out I dis down all of the ditches or all the places where  we couldn't get across the ground to farm it we go disc those dis those you know erosion  
**[0:18:28-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:18:28):**  erosions those ditch erosion places in so that we could get across and farm the whole  thing you know without having to slow down for these these wicked ditches and stuff so  you know growing up doing that kind of thing it really kind of just drove home that there's  
**[0:18:43-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:18:43):**  probably got to be a better way or there's got to be a better system that we're just  like you know we're watching our soil just wash away and we're just you know it just  wasn't wasn't working so I guess that's how I got into soil building I just started reading  
**[0:18:56-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:18:56):**  more about what the soil was like a lot of accounts of prairie soils of what the prairie  soils look like and what they're supposed to function like I read a lot of books there's  a lot of things that were out of universities in the 1920s 30s and 40s that were pretty  
**[0:19:12-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:19:12):**  helpful about rooting depths about these early crops about how they were growing them you  know without any inputs about any fertilizers talking about organic matters of different  soils what the soil kind of looked like and things that they were talking about dark soils  
**[0:19:28-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:19:28):**  were now light yellow clays you know that were highly eroded and they were talking about  the darkness and riches of the clay loam soils and how they were rich and how they could  grow you know 40 and 50 bushel you know 30 40 and 50 bushel wheat back then without a  
**[0:19:43-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:19:43):**  lot of inputs you know they were just living off of the the soil building of thousands  of years of prairie and native vegetation and erosion hadn't taken its course really  and and I guess that that's that's kind of how we got into it and then you know moving  
**[0:19:58-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:19:58):**  on through we've just tried to do more and more all the time about you know as we've  been able to go no-till that left a little bit more moisture soil because we didn't work  it all the time so we had a little bit more moisture to get those crops a little bit further  
**[0:20:11-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:20:11):**  along or to actually put some of these forage crops in and the first few years were the  hardest you know trying to get over that hump there were a few years where you kind of got  into that where you were using moisture to grow the forage crop and then maybe you needed  
**[0:20:28-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:20:28):**  one more good rain to finish that weed out to make it a 50 bushel wheat crop instead  of a 30 bushel wheat crop but there were there were some snags there you know early on but  I guess we just hung with it because we knew that we were using less for diesel fuel we  
**[0:20:42-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:20:42):**  were using less on on chemicals and stuff that we were seeing you know some some benefits  probably the first thing that we really saw that even dad noticed was that we were seeing  that the ditches that used to be huge horrible ditches like I said that we either had to  
**[0:20:56-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:20:56):**  push in or work in they started going away there were depressions you know they weren't  the jagged nasty ditches that you know we really had to do something with you know as  they started to get better they kind of silt in and they were just kind of speed bumps  
**[0:21:11-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:21:11):**  or depressions you know that we could drive across and today most of them are not the  jagged ditches that we really have to worry about they're just kind of a natural you know  flowing area where water can flow once in a while but it's not the the jagged ditches  
**[0:21:26-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:21:26):**  that we used to have that we get horrible rainfall and it just make our ground rough  so I guess that was the first thing we saw was less runoff and less erosion you know  on our side hills and stuff we are in a pretty hilly area of Kansas we're not as flat as  
**[0:21:39-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:21:39):**  they are down in the central corridor along I-70 or anything so you know our water if  it doesn't infiltrate it runs down the hill and runs down into creeks and runs off so  that that was the first things that we saw was we started to see that we could get a  
**[0:21:55-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:21:55):**  forage crop and still a cash crop and I guess you know talking about yield people probably  wonder you know if you're only getting 30 versus 50 or 60 bushel wheat how do you make  it work and it really worked because we started getting more cattle on the operation you know  
**[0:22:08-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:22:08):**  the forage really had that had a place that we weren't spending money you know when we  were following we were always spending money either ten following or going out there and  working the ground you know with diesel and equipment the equipment expense of the upkeep  
**[0:22:22-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:22:22):**  and maintenance on the equipment plus the diesel bill it was pretty high and then when  we got into chem following chem following the the chemical just seemed like you know  it was pretty high we ended up spraying more and more then you know moving from three or  
**[0:22:36-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:22:36):**  four sprays to five and six sprays sometime there at the end when we were chem following  a seven to eight sprays and they really weren't doing the job that they were doing that they  should have done and the ground was still getting rock-hard before we planted so we  
**[0:22:50-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:22:50):**  really kind of moved away from that chem follow and that's really what pushed us down the  path of trying to get more you know more cover crops out there on the ground for that cattle  herd so how big is your farm like how many acres so you guys farm up there farm wise  
**[0:23:09-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:23:09):**  we're about 2700 acres got about probably about 38 3900 acres total with with rains  like rangeland included that's that's increased a little bit over the last few years you know  we we try to grow when we can but it's one of those things we're not really worried about  
**[0:23:29-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:23:29):**  growing bigger as much as now I'm just we're trying to focus on doing better for the soil  you know instead of you know so many times when you get a kid that comes back to the  farm they want to grow you know buy more ground buy more ground and then you know more ground  
**[0:23:43-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:23:43):**  leads to bigger equipment bigger iron so we're trying to do a little bit more of the other  way we're trying to farm about the same amount of ground but we're trying to just do it that  much better like I said this the the whole caveat to this is with cover crops it's kind  
**[0:24:00-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:24:00):**  of a forgotten art because you know maybe you know talking with my dad he could remember  my grandpa doing some of this stuff with more more organically like with plow downs and  that kind of thing with tillage involved but you know he planted a lot more crops than  
**[0:24:15-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:24:15):**  we planted because I never knew anything more than wheat milo we did a little bit of corn  when I was young but it was basically wheat milo fallow and a little bit of corn and we  didn't plan anything else well when dad was growing up they planted oats and barley and  
**[0:24:29-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:24:29):**  a little bit of rye and they had you know more alfalfa they had you know all these different  crops that we I never knew anything about so dad's kind of been the one that's kind  of seen both sides of this he saw it go away when they started farming when he started  
**[0:24:45-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:24:45):**  farming in the 60s and 70s he got away from that went to a wheat fallow system you know  more fertilizers and stuff because that was the way everybody was going and you know he's  kind of gone that full circle now so he's a lot of these things he can remember growing  
**[0:24:58-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:24:58):**  a lot of these crops that we're growing now and they even did some of this too you know  growing up they did some of this with the grazing opportunities out on on cropland a  lot of times you know it was that if the crop wasn't good enough they didn't have a lot  
**[0:25:12-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:25:12):**  of it they didn't have insurance back then so if the crop wasn't good enough they ran  it through their livestock with with cattle and hogs and that kind of thing with my grandpa's  time and my dad's early dad's time is that's that was the way they you know kind of paid  
**[0:25:25-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:25:25):**  the bills if everything fell apart in a drought or something so I guess that you know kind  of going off that that's kind of how we're we've kind of gone back to that the fact that  you know with our forage crops I've really seen a way you know I hate to call them cover  
**[0:25:42-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:25:42):**  crops because if I'm taking them for a forage source you know basically they are kind of  a forage a diverse forage crop but with the caveat of that being is I try to call them  more of a cover crop still because we're only kind of grazing the top parts of the plants  
**[0:25:57-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:25:57):**  we're leaving a lot of the stems and the bottom parts so that we've got an inch or two residue  map laying over the soil just basically because if we if we over basically you can kind of  look at it as one way or another if you want the extra grazing days this year you're gonna  
**[0:26:11-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:26:11):**  pay for it and yield on your following crops because every time we've tried to get those  two or three extra days of grazing out of there and we start seeing bare soil we get  things like more weeds we get a lot of things like more evaporation especially you know  
**[0:26:26-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:26:26):**  it starts hurting a lot more we even see more compaction you know the longer they're out  there on a piece of ground you know you start seeing more compaction if you don't keep moving  them across the across the ground and you kind of limit the amount of time they're in  
**[0:26:38-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:26:38):**  there so I guess we're lucky in the fact that I've never we've never just tried to run them  off cropland alone where we do have the grassland it's kind of the best of both worlds it's  allowed our grassland we bought a lot of rented pastures in the last 10 years that have been  
**[0:26:56-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:26:56):**  overgrazed down to buffalo grass basically so they've needed the rest and recovery to  get some of the different species of grasses going some of our taller grasses but it's  given them the rest of recovery they need so they can grow a little more grass in our  
**[0:27:09-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:27:09):**  pastures but then on the flip side of things we've we've got something to graze out there  on the cropland but then when the croplands done the grasslands have recovered enough  that we can kick them back on the grasslands too so it's kind of the best of both worlds  
**[0:27:22-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:27:22):**  we don't ever over graze or try not to over graze the cropland any because we've always  know we've got grass to go back on and when the grass when we're out on grass we know  on some of this cropland we've got some cover crops growing so that we can kind of negate  
**[0:27:36-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:27:36):**  you know having to over graze our pastures as well so it's kind of a kind of a I don't  want to say it's it's the it's the best system I just want to say it's a system where it  kind of gives you a redundancy especially in dry times that you know you can you can  
**[0:27:51-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:27:51):**  kind of still have forage ahead of those animals you know it's even in our really drought drought  stricken times with the way we're doing things we've been able to keep our cattle herd going  you know with with having them on either a cover crop out on the cropland or out on grass  
**[0:28:05-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:28:05):**  you know during the dry time so it's been it's been pretty pretty interesting to see  the main thing now I've been following you a lot and trying to trying to get even better  about you know learning about you know how to adequately stock grass because as we've  
**[0:28:20-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:28:20):**  got more grass out there we're trying to find that sweet spot where we stock the appropriate  amount and we don't understock that we have a whole bunch of you know unused you know  unused grass or unused cover crop at the end of the year but by the same token I don't

**[0:28:47-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:28:47):**  so you know it's it's one of those things where it's a constant metric that's changing  and I think that I really appreciate what you and some of these other guys have been  doing with rotational grazing and with with you know with amp grazing and things like  
**[0:29:01-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:29:01):**  that because as we do give our grasslands rest and as we give our even our croplands  you know some time to to rest and to recover with these diverse mixes out there to kind  of kind of solve a lot of problems out there we start seeing that our soils do change quite  
**[0:29:18-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:29:18):**  a bit I know that talking talking to some some of you guys that you've seen the same  thing across your operation as well that things that we always thought couldn't happen or  you know things that we thought weren't as productive as as we thought they should be  
**[0:29:32-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:29:32):**  if we give them a little adequate rest all the sudden things blossom and we start seeing  a lot of a lot of a lot of things happen that were out of the realm of possibilities five  or ten years ago at least so.  
**[0:29:46-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:29:46):**  So are you moving are you do you have your cattle at high stock densities or ultra high  or you just kind of somewhere down there fairly low?  Well, let me clarify that too.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:30:00):**  So like nobody's really like written it in stone what high medium and low stock density  is.  And I would say that until you're about 10,000 pounds an acre on a daily move type system  
**[0:30:14-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:30:14):**  that that's not even where high starts like you can you can start saying high stock density  around 10,000 but I think that a lot of us that have done it for a while would what all  kind of agree you need to be up there around 20 to 25,000 pounds an acre on a daily move  
**[0:30:31-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:30:31):**  to really start to start seeing an extremely rapid change in your system.  So that's that's where the floor that I would put you know ultra high would be at 20,000  or maybe that's the floor for high.  
**[0:30:46-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:30:46):**  And we're all over the board I'll tell you that but it kind of depends on our workload  and everything else this last year and stuff well to be quite frank probably the last two  and a half years going on three years now I have twins at home and the twins have kind  
**[0:31:04-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:31:04):**  of rocked my world and the fact that you know how much extra time I've had or how lack thereof  of extra time so I have probably not done as good about daily moves as I as I did before  the twins with and my oldest Thomas is at home too but with the twins and COVID my wife  
**[0:31:23-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:31:23):**  being a nurse and stuff this last year I really have not done real good on some of our grassland  about doing daily moves you know weekly weekly moves have been happening that kind of thing  but I really you know going back to say four or five years ago before before the twins  
**[0:31:42-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:31:42):**  hit when I could do the daily moves on grasslands things that we'd see was immediately it's  really amplified things the the more you can I don't want to say mob the cattle but the  more you can give it you know subdivide and give it rest and recovery time the the most  
**[0:32:01-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:32:01):**  interesting things happen we'd see yellow sweet clover come back from places where we'd  never planted it just by giving it some extra hook traffic and opening it up we'd see things  that I didn't know what the heck they were to be honest you know we never had seen like  
**[0:32:16-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:32:16):**  wild lupins and you know some of these wildflowers and stuff before I was like what are these  things so I had to I had to break out some some books I had to go get some range management  books you know that showed you know wildflowers of Kansas and grasses of Kansas and I'm still  
**[0:32:31-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:32:31):**  getting better at grasses like I see a lot of different grasses out there but I'm not  real good about you know outside of some blue stems and some some some you know major grasses  that we see all the time I have a real hard time discerning what everyone is you know  
**[0:32:44-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:32:44):**  I can kind of I'm just enough to be dangerous that I can tell but I do see now you know  walking across the pastures where we've done a better job of moving and the rest and recovery  on them we have a much better diversity of both like I said the wildflowers and some  
**[0:32:59-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:32:59):**  of those Forbes in there but we also see a lot of diversity of grasses you know the the  thing that I've seen the most is when we change it up we don't have the same rotation where  we don't put them in the pasture at the same time at the same time of year for the same  
**[0:33:13-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:33:13):**  amount of time you know the same time period like we used to when we set stock we start  seeing different grasses come but we also start seeing the species diversity change  too because we always used to have a lot of warm season grass pastures that were over  
**[0:33:28-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:33:28):**  grazed there were basically a lot of buffalo grasses and a lot of you know undesirable  so to speak in there but a lot of those grasses were starting to see a mix of both cool season  and warm season grasses in the pastures now that they're not necessarily just all going  
**[0:33:46-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:33:46):**  to one way or the other they were either cool season grass pastures or warm season grass  pastures and we really didn't have anything with a mix or a diversity between and now  we're starting to see some of that you know some of that happen and the more you know  
**[0:34:00-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:34:00):**  I'm hopeful in the next year or two as my kids get older that we're gonna be able to  go back to doing a lot more with the daily moves it's just been really good for especially  if you've got a lot of those pastures with say like the bottoms that have some marijuana  
**[0:34:16-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:34:16):**  started in them or you know those you know any type of kind of evasive brush or species  the more that you can kind of kind of I don't want to say mob them up the more the more  impact you can give those areas if you can just give them impact for you know even a  
**[0:34:31-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:34:31):**  few hours and get the heck off of them it's amazing how you know you don't have to use  you know as many sprays and everything else that cattle will a lot of things people think  are unpalatable that cattle don't like they will at least trample or they'll you know  
**[0:34:45-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:34:45):**  they'll give a they'll give a browse over you know they'll kind of eat a little bit  of the top of a leaf or something and then they'll trample the rest and it kind of is  a way of weed control too that you don't have to spend quite as much time going out there  
**[0:34:57-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:34:57):**  and spraying we've even seen you know on like thistles before they'll eat thistle heads  off you know and leave you know leave the thistle there but they'll eat the heads off  because there's some kind of protein source or something they're craving out of that thistle  
**[0:35:08-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:35:08):**  head so some of those things that are crazy that you know and I know that this is probably  kind of hard for some people that haven't seen it to do before but I'd say if you don't  you know I heard this from other people you know people people like you know I starting  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:35:22):**  out I heard a lot from your dad Brian you know I went to a few of the conferences and  then two times when he was talking and he's talked about how they start how he started  out with some stuff and then he'd show these you know grasslands how they recovered and  
**[0:35:37-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:35:37):**  how you've done it without you know spraying a lot a lot of you know a lot of things a  lot of outside inputs you know that he was just doing it with with cattle and with some  some fire and some different things you know different different natural tools and it really  
**[0:35:50-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:35:50):**  inspired me in the fact that I was like well you know maybe we can do a little bit for  our operation too you know and that like I said I hope to get back to it a little bit  more because there's a few pastures right now that I think could really benefit to it  
**[0:36:02-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:36:02):**  that we've taken out over in the last few years that we really could take to a little  higher level with that but it's interesting and I guess if it sounds too good to be true  like when I first heard it I thought that it wouldn't work in our area it's only a roll  
**[0:36:16-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:36:16):**  of poly wire and a few step in posts I mean it doesn't take you over a few hundred bucks  of materials to try it you know I mean literally 500 bucks you know get you a good energizer  get you some poly posts and some you know some some wire and just do some subdivisions  
**[0:36:32-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:36:32):**  like even if you do it in fourths or something on a pasture it's going to help some so you  know and the more intense you can do it the better so and probably every farmer at least  most of them that I know they probably already have everything but the poly wire and the  
**[0:36:47-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:36:47):**  step in post that they need to go do it so before we get into talking about you know  what are some ways that let's just say you're talking to your quote neighbors and what are  some way what are some things and some ways that your neighbors could start transitioning  
**[0:37:08-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:37:08):**  from you know a regular conventional max tillage commodity crop farm to a more regenerative  farm that's using less inputs and diesel to grow to still grow crops  I'd say honestly the very first part that I would look at is probably just going out  
**[0:37:30-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:37:30):**  with us going out with a spade or going out with a loader or whatever and dig a hole in  the soil and really start looking at your soil look at how many layers of it if you  see layers that look like somebody like the roadbed if there's any layers where roots  
**[0:37:44-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:37:44):**  aren't going down through those layers if it looks like kind of like a compacted roadbed  that's a pan that's a that's that's definitely a compaction layer in your soil  but cattle grazing cattle did that right didn't cattle cause that compaction layer  
**[0:38:00-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:38:00):**  yeah compaction usually is more of a matter of the amount of time they're out there versus  the amount you know of cattle that are out there but in in my in my world at least but  I think that a lot of times you know just going out there and seeing if you've got a  
**[0:38:14-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:38:14):**  lot of those little tiny layers if it looks like a kind of like a roadbed every few inches  that probably means that you're not getting enough moisture in the soil so really that  would be my first thing is like after a wheat crop would come off or after a crop would  
**[0:38:28-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:38:28):**  come off if you have like a little fallow period there like especially in the stubble  it's really an easy thing to get started into wheat stubble or into say you paid like  oats off or you've cut oats or something in the spring and you've got that that summer  
**[0:38:42-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:38:42):**  window really just go in there something that I've liked that hasn't used a lot of moisture  that they use a lot of in eastern Colorado is millets a German hay millet which is kind  of like a foxtail millet prosil millet which looks a little maybe a little bit more to  
**[0:38:58-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:38:58):**  kind of like a milo plant you know it's a little wider leaf but it's a millet too both  of those millets are very low water use millets are low low water use but they've got really  aggressive fibrous root systems so those will help in the top few inches of opening it up  
**[0:39:13-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:39:13):**  go with kind of like a sunflower or something with a kind of a deeper root I use a lot of  rapeseed on our farm which is basically low oil canola a high oil rapeseed is a canola  plant so the canola plant and what that might work and some of the people rotations further  
**[0:39:31-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:39:31):**  south you know like Oklahoma Texas those kinds of places I know some people have tried to  move canola into their rotations and it's got a really aggressive root system that will  open up the soil but you can put a rapeseed in there some millets some sunflower and maybe  
**[0:39:49-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:39:49):**  you know like a radish or a turnip if you're grazing if you're not grazing you still put  it in because it'll hold on to some of those nutrients and nitrogen and and some phosphorus  and stuff that's left over but just put that out there for a little while and kind of let  
**[0:40:05-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:40:05):**  kind of let water be your guide because on the first few years you might have to terminate  it a little bit early with either cattle or maybe a spray pass or something because the  first few years water is going to be your most limiting factor so you're going to have  
**[0:40:18-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:40:18):**  to kind of really monitor and if it's getting super dry maybe pull the trigger that you've  got a really good residue over the top of the soil and you know and go out and spray  or you know go out and do like a flash graze if it's really dry just do kind of a flash  
**[0:40:33-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:40:33):**  graze over the top just do a real quick you know put quite a few cattle in move them across  the ground pretty quick and just get something out of it you know so that you can kind of  recoup that seed cost but just just don't get too much wrapped up into it because a  
**[0:40:47-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:40:47):**  lot of those millets and sunflowers and you know rapeseed you're not talking like you're  talking over about 15 bucks worth of seed cost you know to get a pretty good residue  but if you can get the residue over the top of the soil and you start getting roots down  
**[0:41:00-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:41:00):**  into the soil you know that's where it starts and you know it's going to be like a couple  year process it's not just going to be a real you know a real quick turnover like I said  you're really going to have to monitor and I'd say the first few years if I was to err  
**[0:41:16-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:41:16):**  I'd err on the side of leaving more residue out there maybe it costs you a little bit  up front but it's going to be given back to you in the next following crops because you're  going to have less evaporation and you're also going to have more infiltration because  
**[0:41:28-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:41:28):**  the more of that residue mat you have over the top of the soil it's going to keep the  soil cooler it's going to keep microbes and some worms and stuff alive in the soil and  you're going to start seeing some of those things start happening in your soil so that  
**[0:41:40-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:41:40):**  when you get those bigger rains they're going to start getting more rained in the profile  because really you know under the way we used to manage it under fallow we'd always want  to see moisture clear up to the you know very top basically right where we were working  
**[0:41:53-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:41:53):**  the ground or where we were team following and you know I guess you know with that's  the mindset that we've got to change is that I don't want to see moisture on top of the  ground I want it down in one two three and four foot in my profile because that's where  
**[0:42:09-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:42:09):**  the roots are going to get to it it's not going to be evaporated out of the soil you  know if it hangs around in the top six inches or foot of soil it's going to be evaporated  or it's going to be you know it's going to in a dry time it's just going to be lost you're  
**[0:42:22-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:42:22):**  just going to be farming in a flower pot basically so you know instead of looking like you're  farming in a flower pot you really want to look like you're farming you know you're farming  in the top six foot of soil instead of the top six inches so the more you can get those  
**[0:42:34-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:42:34):**  root systems in there after we harvest as those cover crops or as these forage crops  would be grazed off or die off the next following cash crops they're lazy they don't want to  expend any more energy than they have to so they'll follow a lot of those old root channels  
**[0:42:50-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:42:50):**  down and so every year you're kind of building so maybe the first year you only get them  down in the top you know say you were only getting them down six or eight inches the  first year then you get it in down foot and a half two foot and you know pretty soon you're  
**[0:43:03-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:43:03):**  down through two to three foot four foot you know down in that profile where the you know  even though it doesn't rain you know it will hold the the crops will hold on they'll wait  for that moisture a little bit further so that's basically it's an investment in your

**[0:43:31-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:43:31):**  in year three four and five or a year ten down the road you know that you're actually  building a better soil that can take those bigger rains get them down into the soil and  you know be useful for the following crops so it's a little bit of upfront investment  
**[0:43:45-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:43:45):**  but I found that it does kind of pay especially in those freak weather events whether it's  really really wet year or it's a really really dry year if you've got that soil opened up  that it can take more of those rains and you have more of a you know more of a profile  
**[0:43:58-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:43:58):**  it buffers those extreme weather events so.  So you mentioned terminating a cover crop with cattle and I've always been a little  bit curious about that I know it's possible how do you do it?  
**[0:44:13-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:44:13):**  Basically that that's where it gets into you know if you're to do it I'd say you definitely  make sure that you've got a son or a daughter or you've got a you know that you've got enough  help to do it but you really need to probably do pretty high intensity grazing you know  
**[0:44:30-0:44:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:44:30):**  to move them across you've really got to graze it and I'm not gonna say it's gonna be a hundred  percent perfect you know that you're gonna get a hundred percent perfect kill where you're  gonna you know go right back in and have a you know a dead brown mat to work in that'll  
**[0:44:45-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:44:45):**  all depend I guess on what time you're you know if you have frost on your side if you're  doing a warm season you know mix and you've got frost coming up on your side if you graze  it down you know you graze it down and leave the residue chances are frost you know you  
**[0:44:59-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:44:59):**  can plant wheat right into it the frost is gonna take all those warm seasons out and  you're gonna have a really nice seed bed you know if you're gonna have a little bit of  you know that that sorghum sedan is gonna give a little bit of a microclimate for your  
**[0:45:10-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:45:10):**  wheat that it's it's not gonna just come out into you know open air or the heat or whatever  it's got that you know some residue to kind of buffer those temperatures you know as that  young plants emerging so it kind of helps you know weed emerge that kind of thing too  
**[0:45:25-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:45:25):**  since we've been doing it we really haven't had that ground be hard because it used to  just set up kind of I'd equate it to a brick you know just get real hard we couldn't hardly  get the drill into the ground it was so hard and since we've been leaving more residue  
**[0:45:37-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:45:37):**  on top of the ground I'm not gonna say walking across it it feels like a sponge but when  you walk across soil that's been managed you can kind of feel you can feel it under your  feet there's some gift you know it's got some spring so I don't know I think the thing with  
**[0:45:54-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:45:54):**  terminating it is you've got to kind of have some poly wire out there and you've got to  pretty much do a daily move and you've got to kind of keep them keep them moving that  you get enough of it you know it works kind of like a roller crimper honestly if you've  
**[0:46:07-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:46:07):**  got them out there you know at a high enough density they'll you know they've got enough  especially and I guess the other thing to take into account too if you really want a  lot of that residue in contact with the soil we found the long narrow paddocks work better  
**[0:46:21-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:46:21):**  than like a square paddock the long narrow paddocks seem like you know cattle always  want to walk a fence or they always want to find their perimeters so if you have a long  narrow paddock they'll want to walk back and forth it seems like a little bit more at least  
**[0:46:34-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:46:34):**  our cattle do I'm not gonna say everybody's does this is just my experience on my my farm  and my ranch but that our cattle seem to you know go around they'll find their perimeters  but you know they'll always graze a little bit closer to their water at first but you  
**[0:46:48-0:47:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:46:48):**  know they'll go back and forth and it seems like those long narrow ones seem to get it  in contact with the soil a little bit more than if we're to go more of a square you know  the square they'll get more forage utilization they'll graze it down but there won't be quite  
**[0:47:04-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:47:04):**  as much residue so I guess for me I'm not a good cattleman and the fact that that I'm  looking at more of that as long as they're taking the tops or they're taking the best  of it off I could care less if they're really you know if they're leaving you know two or  
**[0:47:19-0:47:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:47:19):**  three days worth of grazing out there it's gonna be residue that's gonna help me cycle  nutrients in the future and it's gonna keep my ground cooler so I am giving up some grazing  days because I have had some people stop by they go Michael you could have got two or  
**[0:47:32-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:47:32):**  three more grazing days out of this I go I know I could have but I said every time I've  tried to get greedy it's come back to bite me you know and in either the you know either  the grounds a little bit harder because I've kept them in the ground I kept them on a piece  
**[0:47:45-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:47:45):**  of ground too long they've done too much back and forth or you know they've taken too much  and then the weeds come on or quite frankly a lot of times I've just taken too much and  then the sun beats down on and on lose it to evaporation so the more I can get kind  
**[0:47:59-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:47:59):**  of that roller crimper type of action you know and get more of a you know a residue  mat it's gonna cost me a little bit up front and grazing days but it's gonna pay for me  you know the next two years of weed control and also residue and also getting more moisture  
**[0:48:13-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:48:13):**  into the ground you know when we get those heavy rains that extra residue does slow those  raindrops down enough that that it does help infiltration some so so let's talk about  spraying versus grazing in a no-till type system are you still doing you're still doing a little  
**[0:48:30-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:48:30):**  spraying aren't you oh yeah yeah yeah we're still doing we're still doing spraying probably  more than I'd like because you know as we as we move further through this something that's really  been a no-brainer I guess in the way of spray you know a way of trying to eliminate spray  
**[0:48:47-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:48:47):**  tricks for me is the the cool season warm season like a stack cover crop it might be a little bit  harder to try to get another crop to follow that because you have used a lot of soil moisture and  a stack cover crop so I'll do like a cool season mix like say a oat pea turnip type of thing in the  
**[0:49:05-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:49:05):**  spring graze that off and like that May June timeframe and then turn right back around and  try to follow that with some depending on how wet or how dry we are if we're drier I'll probably go  heavier on like those German and pro so millets and sunflower you know something that's a little  
**[0:49:22-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:49:22):**  bit cheaper that I don't know how much grazing I'm gonna get out of it anyway so I'm gonna fault on  the side and being a little bit cheaper and just to you know ensure that I've got ground cover and  I'm also keeping a living root out there and I'll still get some grazing out of it if we're a little  
**[0:49:37-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:49:37):**  bit wetter after that you know we get some good rains and early June and I've still got moisture  I'm more likely to probably put some forage sorghum and sorghum sedans in there probably  some more legumes maybe a cow pee or mung bean soybeans if we you know a lot of times we'll  
**[0:49:56-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:49:56):**  throw the soybeans in if we've got extra soybeans left around you know some of these some of these  crop you know cash crop dealers that they have soybeans that once they're done they'll let go  for you know plot beans and stuff like that they'll just give you you know to put in a mix  
**[0:50:10-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:50:10):**  or something so you know it doesn't have to be expensive but a lot of times we'll we'll clean  out some of that seed that we've got left over and just throw it in a mix like that but we'll  put a warm season mix in then that warm season mix would be like in that August September timeframe  
**[0:50:24-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:50:24):**  maybe before we're ready to go out to stocks we can do that so I don't know you know that that  will work for everybody but it's sure a way to keep chemical down because we've been able to go  like almost two full years without a chemical application so like if we're going into corn  
**[0:50:42-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:50:42):**  stocks in the spring we won't have sprayed that corn since the spring before so that's already  a year when we plant that oat pea crop and then the oat pea crop will just be terminated with  cattle and basically the heat keeps it back so it doesn't come back after that and then that  
**[0:50:57-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:50:57):**  warm season crop comes on we can graze that out and then we won't have any chemical till the spring  of the following year so we'll go basically two full years without any chemical application so if  you're truly wanting to get a little way away from that spraying you can do that the main thing is I  
**[0:51:13-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:51:13):**  guess you got to be really flexible on your rotation which some guys are some guys aren't  on their cash crops with us if we can get the opportunity to get a wheat crop in in the fall  great if it looks like it's we've used enough moisture up with all these forage crops we can't  
**[0:51:27-0:51:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:51:27):**  get back to wheat we'll just let it recharge recharge moisture over the winter time and get  right back into the spring with a row crop in the spring so that's kind of we leave it a little bit  open-ended about what other nature gives us for moisture so how are you keeping track of that  
**[0:51:44-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:51:44):**  moisture you keep in detailed records are you doing some soil testing and sampling and what  others and if you're doing soil testing what other types of soil testing are you doing and why okay  that's kind of all-encompassing a few years back I actually did get some moisture probes like what  
**[0:52:04-0:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:52:04):**  they use for irrigation to keep track of some soil moisture and because I always had you know  we just do it off intuition you know you know how much moisture is out there and that you know  people would come up to me and say well how do you know how much moisture using and everything well  
**[0:52:20-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:52:20):**  you know after we'd had those in the ground it really proved that we use moisture up with the  forage crops but it also prepared our ground for when we got the bigger rains like we got a we've  got like two and three inch rains before and instead of you know running over you know terrace  
**[0:52:37-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:52:37):**  channels clear full and causing a bunch of erosion without the erosion you actually have it actually  infiltrate the ground because it's we've used some moisture but the point but if we didn't use the  moisture the moisture the profile would be full and then it would just go to erosion but where  
**[0:52:54-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:52:54):**  we've used some moisture the ground is actually ready to absorb that so I'd say that you know  that that's one one tool that we've used in the past we use a lot of you know I use a lot of just  regular soil probe like a t-handled probe just a regular soil probe to to assess how much moisture  
**[0:53:13-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:53:13):**  is in the ground sometimes it makes me happy and sometimes I kind of get a little bit nervous about  you know moisture levels but I think overall you know we're seeing that we've got more in the sub  soil year in and year out with this system the other thing with soil testing we really have kind  
**[0:53:33-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:53:33):**  of gone a little bit further away from like a conventional acid-based soil test where it's an  acid-based extraction method where they just soak the soil in an acid to tell you how much nitrogen  and potassium and phosphorus you have in your soils we have done a little bit more with the  
**[0:53:51-0:54:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:53:51):**  Haney soil test which is a biologic soil test they use a very weak acid which is more like a citric  acid which is you know found in fruits which is more like what's found in rainwater so it's a  little bit more like what the plant can assess after rain sometimes I will give the caveat that  
**[0:54:11-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:54:11):**  sometimes our Haney soil results are not looking quite as high as the acid extraction but that's  because it's a weaker acid too so you know even though the the results don't look quite as high  we haven't had a time where we've felt like our nutrients have been deficient and a lot of that's  
**[0:54:35-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:54:35):**  because the soil biology basically is the microbes the fungi those kinds of things that are  in your soil they're they're turning over nutrients you know I think that's one of the  biggest fallacies that I've learned going through this is that growing up we always thought we fed  
**[0:54:52-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:54:52):**  the plant directly if we put the nitrogen on the potassium the phosphorus on that we fed the plant  like the the plant roots reach out they grab hold of this and just directly drag it into the plant  you know that we're actually feeding the plant and that's really pretty far from the truth because  
**[0:55:07-0:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:55:07):**  even in you know even in the most abused soils there's still some biology and the biology is  what's converting it that's why in a lot of soils we're having to see that are more abused that are  lower organic matter that's why you see a lot of those soils you need to put more nutrients on  
**[0:55:24-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:55:24):**  because there's not as much natural cycling going on because that biology there's not just there's  not much biology actually living there working to cycle that so the more you can keep that soil  cooler with that residue the more moisture because all these things are sub aquatic they need moisture  
**[0:55:41-0:55:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:55:41):**  to live just like we need a drink once in a while on a hot day they do too so the more moisture we've  got that profile the more that we can cycle those nutrients so what I'm saying is that even though  we're not putting on as much nutrients our nutrients still are going as far as they were  
**[0:55:56-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:55:56):**  before because a lot of this biology is creating a lot of plant available nutrients a lot of amino  acids and a lot of extracts that the plant can get naturally through its root system that's  available to the plant that helps it grow the soil can provide that so the further we go down  
**[0:56:16-0:56:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:56:16):**  this this route with the grazing and getting more biology back into our soils and keeping that  biology alive through those dry times or those those hotter times during the summer the more we  can rely on our soils providing without having to put extra inputs in you know our nitrogen we've  
**[0:56:35-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:56:35):**  been able to scale back some on our nitrogen potassium and phosphorus are two things we've  really have been able to pretty much go away from on almost every piece of ground that we've done  this on for a long time mostly because a lot of these cover crops are keeping keeping those things  
**[0:56:54-0:57:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:56:54):**  available they're not as bound up in a lot of our calcium we have pretty high calcium soils and can  have higher pH soils in our area so a lot of those nutrients can be bound up in those those chemical  bonds and if the if there's a living root out there and that biology is alive not as much as  
**[0:57:13-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:57:13):**  going to be bound up in those chemical bonds there's going to be more available to that plant  life so as we're going further down this road we're seeing just little things like that that's  kind of how you start paying the bills you know knowing that your nitrogen like 40 units of  
**[0:57:27-0:57:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:57:27):**  nitrogen is gonna act more like 80 units of nitrogen or you know 80 units of nitrogen on  corn is all you need because you know you'll probably never hit top end yield because our top  you never top out the nitrogen level because you're having a lot cycling with your increased organic  
**[0:57:43-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:57:43):**  matter and also the increase in the soil carbon and the microbes that are feeding your your corn  crops so that's just kind of where we're kind of where we're at or what we've been doing okay so  let's just say I gave you a time machine and you could go back and and talk to yourself the day  
**[0:58:05-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:58:05):**  after your mom pulled you aside on the porch and said farm is not for you what would you what would  you tell yourself oh probably the first thing I would have told myself was uh you know don't be  so you know I was pretty hard on myself for a while there you know but I think the probably

**[0:59:12-0:59:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:59:12):**  didn't get into those you know till the probably late to probably about 2008 2009 we really started  playing around with cover crops I really wish when we would have went no-till that we would have  started the cover crops right away you know if we would have started that in 2000 we would have got  
**[0:59:28-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:59:28):**  a lot more moisture into our soils and it would have been a lot less hard I think a lot more  people would be successful with no-till if they had like diverse forages or cover crops and their  rotation so you know that's just that's just just my take on it but that you know a lot of the road  
**[0:59:45-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=0:59:45):**  blocks that we had with our ground getting hard we had some chemical you know our chemicals stop  really killing weeds because we were spraying just to spray and I think that you know the more  residue we can have out there and that kind of thing the less we have to worry about the less  
**[1:00:02-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:00:02):**  we have to worry about paying or you know our bills aren't as high because we don't have any  trips across our fields and we're really kind of farming more with it within context of our region  you know when we don't have to do extra tillage passes or extra spray trips across our ground  
**[1:00:16-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:00:16):**  we're really farming a little bit more with the way our you know our native prairie ecosystem was  was designed you know in the original intent of our soils so okay there any any big challenges  you faced lately or any wrecks you've had you'd like to share and some lessons learned? I guess  
**[1:00:40-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:00:40):**  the the major wreck I'd say was that you know go into it and and really find kind of a mentor in  your area if you can you know some some areas are a little bit harder to find than others and your  area might mean two or three counties away just try to keep it within your context that you know  
**[1:00:59-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:00:59):**  you find somebody that kind of fits your ideals of the way you're farming that you want to kind of  emulate the way they're you know the way they're farming you know like if you're a crop if you're  a crop and livestock guy really try to find a crop and a livestock guy to kind of follow it's not bad  
**[1:01:15-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:01:15):**  to follow just a just a livestock guy but the livestock guy can push things a lot harder because  he's only going after the forage you know availability whereas if you're trying to get a  cash crop as well which some people are moving away from which is fine but if you're trying to  
**[1:01:31-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:01:31):**  get a cash crop as well you really can't you really got to know how hard you can push the  forage side of things and still not really ding your yields real hard on the cash crop side  because even as we improve soils there's only so much water holding capacity and you know there's  
**[1:01:46-1:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:01:46):**  only so much moisture that you've got your profile so you really got to be cognizant of that I think  but really finding a mentor that's been doing these that can kind of share some of the roadblocks or  the hurdles that they've had you know it just shaves off a lot of your your learning time you're  
**[1:02:03-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:02:03):**  gonna be a little bit faster out of the gate with with being successful the other thing I'd say  probably is also is also probably you've got to you've got to you've got to probably find a find  a happy medium with with how much moisture you're willing to use for your forage crops versus how  
**[1:02:30-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:02:30):**  much you know are you going to really push if you're wanting to push your crop yields you're  probably gonna have to terminate your forages earlier if you you know if you're really not  you're able to get enough grazing days or compensate somehow with the cover crop you  
**[1:02:48-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:02:48):**  know that it pays you know maybe you can you can have a little bit less yield and still have the  same amount of profit because you're gonna have less spray trips less fertilizers into it so it's  really about trying to make it work you know on your on your terms because everybody farms a  
**[1:03:06-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:03:06):**  little bit differently so there's really no right or wrong way to do it but I'd say really sit down  and I'd say the other thing was you just can't be rigid on your rotations you're really gonna have to  be flexible especially the first few years with what you're gonna plant you know you can kind of  
**[1:03:22-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:03:22):**  have an idea of how many acres you want to certain crops but really different pieces of ground are  gonna need different management because they've all been managed differently with different forms  of tillage and you know how much erosion or how little erosion they've had how long they've been  
**[1:03:37-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:03:37):**  in into you know a no-till system versus how short they've been in a no-till system you know and it  just really depends it's all over the board you really just have to go about it and I'd say go in  littles you know the biggest train wreck I think I've had recently was really buying into you know  
**[1:03:57-1:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:03:57):**  more is always better you know more diversity in your cover crops is always better especially a lot  of the things that weren't from our region or aren't really something that can you know thrive  in a lower rainfall area I've taken some stuff from you know guys that are further east to me  
**[1:04:16-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:04:16):**  that get a little bit more rainfall or more timely rainfall and I found that some of those things  fall flat you know for their West so I think that it's always good to find a friend that's maybe a  little further west than you kind of adopt what they're doing and also don't buy into a lot of  
**[1:04:32-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:04:32):**  the you know I'm gonna say diversity is good but you also have to find the diversity that works on  your operation because you can have 64 way blend and if you don't see you know and you spend 60 or  70 dollars on it you're gonna be burnt out after your first year on cover cropping because you're  
**[1:04:52-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:04:52):**  not gonna be able to see an economic return on that blend so I'd rather see a guy go out and  spend you know maybe do a six or an eight way mix and spend you know 15 20 bucks an acre on it you  know or maybe $30 an acre if they're going after grazing plant a little bit thicker and you know  
**[1:05:09-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:05:09):**  go after the grazing but have a more simple simple cover crop and go into it the way of making it pay  versus you know going out there with idea I'm gonna you know take out all my compaction layers  I'm gonna put a lot of legumes out there to fix all my nitrogen and all my nutrient requirements  
**[1:05:26-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:05:26):**  and you know I'm gonna do this you know high-end dollar cover crop and then all of a sudden you  know it still gets weedy and you still have a lot of problems then what do you do you know I mean  you're you've got to spray it out or something and then you're out you know so you go get mad  
**[1:05:39-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:05:39):**  at your seed man because the magic bullet he sold you didn't work the first time yeah I think that  you know that's the best thing that I can give is find guys that are doing it and see what they're  doing don't don't discount a cover crop seed dealer or a seed dealer because they do have  
**[1:05:58-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:05:58):**  some knowledge for your region but also you know really quiz them why they're putting certain things  in or why you why straight out the gate you need this in your mix because overall you're gonna be  the one that has to pay for that you know the seed dealer is gonna sell his seed and once it leaves  
**[1:06:13-1:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:06:13):**  his facility it's no longer his duty to worry about how it's paid for so you know up front I  do a lot more reading and a lot more you know kind of there's a lot of good resources cover crop you  know on cover crops and different blends and different things on the internet so really delve  
**[1:06:30-1:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:06:30):**  in there and really start talking to some of your neighbors go to go to a cover crop field day  because I'll tell you the weirdest thing happened to me was I have a friend that is two years younger  than me that went through high school and I didn't know what he was doing on his farm he's only eight  
**[1:06:48-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:06:48):**  miles down the road but I didn't know what he was doing he didn't know what I was doing and we  happened to go to a cover crop field day and here we were I was like hey that looks like Clint's  pickup and as soon as I walked through yeah there they were there he was sitting and you know we  
**[1:07:03-1:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:07:03):**  were talking like I didn't know you did cover crops and yeah I've done it for a year or two  and I've done it for a year or two and you know we were both pretty new to it but then we had our  own little you know own little you know group kind of a group of two to start out with and then it  
**[1:07:17-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:07:17):**  became four five and six you know people in our region and we kind of see what worked and what  didn't bounce ideas off each other but you don't really know sometimes what's going on in your own  area so either get out drive around and if you see something freaky out there you know like what the  
**[1:07:31-1:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:07:31):**  heck's that you know mess of different plants out there go find who's ground it is and go talk to  them you know if they're they're willing because most guys that are doing this are more than  willing to share I haven't really found anybody that says you know this is proprietary knowledge  
**[1:07:45-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:07:45):**  I'll be darned if I'm going to share this with you most people are very willing and open to say  you know this work for me this hasn't worked for me and kind of give you some background when you're  developing these things so you really don't get a lot of bangs and no you know bang for your buck  
**[1:08:00-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:08:00):**  or anything so I'd say that you know those are the things to look at and really be cognizant there  are my early days I remember one time I spent $45 an acre on seed costs which was very very high  that was back when I was teaching so I kind of got a little crazy and took some money out of a  
**[1:08:19-1:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:08:19):**  paycheck and decided that I'd I'd come really really give this piece of ground the you know  the works we got good grazing out of it and I did I saw most the species I planted not as thick as  I thought some of the species should be because again I was planning some things that were a lot  
**[1:08:37-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:08:37):**  wetter environments than what you know what we were planning into but I will say that the Haney  score on that that where I spent all that extra money it jumped tremendously from the diversity  so there are some things to be said for diversity but also underlying you've got to pay your bills  
**[1:08:53-1:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:08:53):**  you know day in and day out we've got to service our debt and pay our bills you know and I know  there's guys out there that right now you know chemical and fertilizer and everything else they're  literally drowning in a lot of bills and I really think if we are a little proactive you know we  
**[1:09:11-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:09:11):**  give up a few of those grazing days up front we maybe leave a little bit more residue out there  instead of bailing off our straw or bailing off the corn stover bales we leave a little residue  on our ground we give a little bit up front this year it's gonna come back and help us in years  
**[1:09:25-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:09:25):**  two three and four and I know that's hard for a lot of guys that are in a pinch you know they're  seeing the real quick cash you know a real quick way to get a little cash but a lot of times bailing  off all that stuff or taking all that extra residue off or getting that extra grazing to  
**[1:09:40-1:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:09:40):**  where it's just bare dirt it's really costing you you know in the future that you if you really give  a little bit even though you're in a in a hard way up front it'll save you two or three spray  trips next year and your inputs will be that much lower and the banker will be that much happier  
**[1:09:54-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:09:54):**  with you so you know I just from a financial standpoint I know there are guys right now that  it it is a time where it hurts recently our bank went through our bank got bought out by a bigger  bank basically because we had some some people that were larger farmers that had some some credit  
**[1:10:15-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:10:15):**  problems and you know we're a few we're one of the few farmers that are left in our bank just because  you know there's a lot of a lot of problems right now with servicing debt as we've we've kind of  talked our banker through this I think that's something else you've got to really sit down  
**[1:10:33-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:10:33):**  with your lenders and with you know with everybody you know and really get on the same page you know  and tell them how you're gonna pay for this and make this work up front and really you need to do  the research up front think how many grazing days you need to get out of this how many you know  
**[1:10:49-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:10:49):**  again how many spray your spray trips you can save with this you know you really be proactive  and trying to formulate a budget you know to really help these guys understand because a lot  of guys you know a lot of lending institutions now aren't real AG savvy that they're getting less  
**[1:11:07-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:11:07):**  less AG savvy as we go along so you really need to tell them you know every you know every time  I go to the chemical dealer and buy a pickup load of chemical you know that's 10 15 20 thousand  dollars that I could be spending on this diverse forage crop and that's a one-shot thing I could  
**[1:11:24-1:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:11:24):**  maybe spend five grand on this diverse forage crop I could run another you know I can keep  my heifers and put extra weight on or you know or background you know background some animals I can  you know maybe take my heifers up to you know bread heifers instead of selling them is just  
**[1:11:39-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:11:39):**  you know selling them selling them as open heifers you know I can do bread heifers I could you know  make this work and really walk through your banker about how to make this work you know because we've  been really blessed that we have a really good AG a really good banker our loan officer is really AG  
**[1:11:56-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:11:56):**  savvy he didn't grow up on a farm but he grew up around us all the time so he knows what's going on  and he's really worked with us and been pretty proactive and understands the value of no-till  once we've been doing it and really you know it's it's pretty cool that you know a few times I've  
**[1:12:11-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:12:11):**  had you know local banks sponsor these field days because they see that this is a way to you know  kind of have less operating expense and still have the same kind of you know the same kind of living  at the end of the day you know the same take-home pay at the end of the day it's just less it's a  
**[1:12:27-1:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:12:27):**  less input intensive way also during dry times it helps me sleep at night to be quite honest I have  yet to have a time where I put my head on the pillow there's been some times I've been kind of  stressed with workload and everything else but there hasn't been a time where I put my head down  
**[1:12:41-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:12:41):**  and I've worried about you know where my next meal is coming from or how I'm gonna service my debt  because I always know that you know since we've been doing this that there's a there's there's  kind of a what I want to say a way you know there's there's there's always a way to make  
**[1:12:57-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:12:57):**  revenue from this way and there's less inputs into it so I know that even in the worst years  that there's gonna be ways that I'm gonna service my debt and cover my debt so that kind of that  kind of I guess strikes at home to me is that you've just got to kind of be proactive and figure  
**[1:13:11-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:13:11):**  this out and to me if you're not really having to go to the bank and service huge debt it's at the  end of the day you're probably living a little bit better life than somebody that's beholding to the  bank making every last decision so that's kind of where where I'm at that's my own personal view you  
**[1:13:28-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:13:28):**  know everybody has their own views and can farm how they want but you know for peace of mind for  me it helps me sleep at night it helps me know too that I can walk in any day and if I need you know  if I need to buy some more animals or if I need another you know another pasture or something  
**[1:13:43-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:13:43):**  comes close you know across the road or something that works really well for operation that I could  you know that I can get that you know too so it's not a perfect system but it's been one that's kind  of a we talked about holistic planning really the the more you do and planning the less you have to

**[1:14:16-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:14:16):**  because you've already thought through these things you know during your downtime if you have  time during the winter or early spring really be thinking about these things you know and I even  encourage guys now with wheat and stuff being done and you know with fall harvest coming up what are  
**[1:14:31-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:14:31):**  some things that you could probably plug in forage wise maybe rise criticales things like that for  grazing or even you know if nothing more just for ground cover you know to keep that spray bill down  like what can you be doing now think about that you know in those August gap those down days in  
**[1:14:46-1:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:14:46):**  August before you really get busy with fall harvest what's something I can do right behind  the combine or I can do this fall to make it easier for next spring and next summer so you  know just just always be thinking about six months or a year down the road what you can be doing just  
**[1:15:01-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:15:01):**  thinking about you know we're recording this kind of toward the end of July just thinking about what  most of my farmer friends are doing this time of year they're living at the lake riding around you  know water skiing wakeboarding doing all kinds of fun stuff like that so where um where can we find  
**[1:15:18-1:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:15:18):**  you on social media you run uh you're on a Facebook group and you're kind of active on  Twitter yes yes uh probably probably uh the the I guess I don't want to say it it's it's interesting  but the the best thing that I probably ever did was I created the Kansas Nebraska uh soil  
**[1:15:37-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:15:37):**  stewardship group you can search for it on Facebook and basically you know how I kind  of talked about how a few of my friends were doing the cover cropping we had a real hard time  some of them had kids and with scheduling we had a real hard time actually physically sitting down  
**[1:15:52-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:15:52):**  and meeting outside of the dead of winter you know January, February we could but during the growing  season everybody had cool things going on but we had a hard time meeting up and going to everybody's  farm and stuff so that actually kind of came out of just again it's for everybody if you're not  
**[1:16:07-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:16:07):**  in Kansas or Nebraska it's no sweat because we've got guys from Australia and you know Ukraine and  everywhere Africa all over the place now but but it started out as Kansas Nebraska because we lived  on the Kansas Nebraska state line and so all my friends were in Kansas and Nebraska so it was like  
**[1:16:22-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:16:22):**  a group of six of us and we just post like cover crop pictures and just talk about it well then it  kind of got interesting in the fact that a few more people were like hey what's this you know  and they added on and they started they were doing some grazing and stuff a huge resource that's on  
**[1:16:37-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:16:37):**  there is Candy Thomas if you don't know her she's basically our whole region Nebraska, Colorado,  Kansas you know this whole Iowa I think Missouri even now I can't say she keeps getting more and  more region all the time but she's our soil health specialist that works for NRCS and you know you  
**[1:16:58-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:16:58):**  want to talk about somebody that she just knows I mean she's got such she's a reader she's read so  much and she always is posting good stuff on there about you know soils about improving soils and  changing soils she's been a huge resource on there I'm kind of a nerd and I'll read some crazy stuff  
**[1:17:16-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:17:16):**  research papers and stuff and put that on there and I'm not afraid to try some new stuff once in  a while you know on a few acres just to see if it works but you know we're always trying to post  stuff on there about what's going on and it's for grazing it's for cover cropping and it's a place  
**[1:17:31-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:17:31):**  to ask questions don't ever feel like you can't you know just ask hey I'm totally new and I have  this problem because there's a lot of people across the region and I'm not going to say you're  going to get one clear-cut answer too because if there's 20 people that give you an answer you  
**[1:17:44-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:17:44):**  might get 20 different answers but you can kind of glean from each one of those answers and kind of  see what fits your context or what fits your your area so you know that's that's some place that I'm  probably you know and you can friend me on Facebook Michael Thompson but anyway you know  
**[1:18:02-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:18:02):**  that that soil health group has really been a cool thing to see how it's evolved I don't even know  there's two or three thousand people on it now so from all over the globe and you know it's it's  cool that there's there's people that have real long experience with it too so you know I think  
**[1:18:18-1:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:18:18):**  that that would be that would be a cool thing for a lot of people if they're just dipping their  toes in the water and they just want to see what's going on we welcome everybody you know the main  thing is that you know I it's it's kind of an environment where we don't really do the the  
**[1:18:32-1:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:18:32):**  strife and the you know if you you don't have positive things to say you know you might not  be in there for a real long time we try to keep it positive and everything else but we do try to  have discussion too you know real discussion about the pros and cons and different things and  
**[1:18:45-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:18:45):**  everybody's had different experiences so it's a great way to get experience the other thing I'm  on twitter and this is terribly hard to find me on twitter because it's got a whole bunch of numbers  after Michael but it's Michael 7254 I have to even look at it because I don't even know it anymore  
**[1:19:04-1:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:19:04):**  7254 0562 but anyway if you look up Michael Thompson and you look at there you'll find me  I'll cheat I'll put a link in the show notes to Michael's twitter profile you you put it you put  a you put a link in there because it's it's even hard for me to do you know but they deleted my  
**[1:19:23-1:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:19:23):**  one it used to be Thompson farm and ranch and they deleted that one I wasn't on it for a couple  months I was off social media for a while and I went back and it said that I couldn't have access  to my old account so I had to get this new one so that's long story short that's where I'm at but on  
**[1:19:38-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:19:38):**  on twitter you know that the cool part about twitter I think is that there's a lot of people  that are in the soil health arena and they're posting a lot of stuff about how to make it work  and it's a really cool way to get people from all over the all over the region that you wouldn't  
**[1:19:55-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:19:55):**  necessarily know and like you know people like you know yourself Brian and you know people that have  more of a grazing background you can go there and you can see what people are doing on a grazing  standpoint and then you can clue it right back over to maybe a cropping standpoint and see guys  
**[1:20:09-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:20:09):**  that are doing that and it's really cool in the fact that I've had a lot of people on twitter  that I've met that weren't really interested in cover crops they were pretty much crop farmers  and all of a sudden they got interested you know they're they're asking more questions I've seen  
**[1:20:22-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:20:22):**  their dip their toes into cover crops and it's cool in the fact that they can ask questions I  can ask questions it's kind of a big forum to ask questions and it's really a neat area that you  really find a lot of cool people out there that you would never have met otherwise I've got some  
**[1:20:37-1:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:20:37):**  friends on there I still haven't met in person but that you know we we we're in chat groups and  we talk a lot about you know different things about cover crops and make them work across  Kansas and down into Oklahoma and stuff so that's probably the coolest thing is just kind of  
**[1:20:52-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:20:52):**  find some people and find kind of your little group and then from your little group you know  get on you know there's a lot of things whether it be a text group you know group chat you know  with texting or you know there's whatsapp there's a lot of different apps that you can have like a  
**[1:21:06-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:21:06):**  kind of small group hosting you know where you can do that zoom's been another thing in the  last ever since you know COVID's hit I don't think I need to tell anybody that if you haven't  attended some kind of learning or zoom meeting you know you've probably been living under a rock  
**[1:21:19-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:21:19):**  because there's all sorts of learning that's been going on but it's been cool in the fact that  the zoom meetings have brought us even though we can't physically be sitting across the table from  one another it's like it's it's about as close of alternative as we can without physically being in  
**[1:21:32-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:21:32):**  the same room and it's cool the fact that you know something that would have taken me 10 hours to a  conference that's clear across the country I could jump on a zoom and I can get with 10 of my friends  from all over the country even we've even done it where I've had some friends from Western Australia  
**[1:21:49-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:21:49):**  and Australia jump on and we've been able to do you know either like through Facebook or through  zoom or something we've been able to do like a video chat where we've been able to keep up with  each other you know via that too so that's really the neat part is that there's just so much  
**[1:22:03-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:22:03):**  knowledge and I want to say the internet's a great tool out there that there's a lot of knowledge  and for the first time there's a lot of papers out there that even if you're not a scientist  if you're interested in cover crops and interested in some of this stuff there's a lot of things off  
**[1:22:16-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:22:16):**  google scholar and things like that if you really want to delve in that there's a lot of knowledge  that you can get out there so the main thing is just talk really talk to people the bigger your  net is the more you cast your net out there the more friends if you you know if you talk to joe  
**[1:22:31-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:22:31):**  maybe joe doesn't have the answer but he's been talking to tim over here you know and and you know  some other area tim in south dakota knows and he'll direct you towards tim and you're like hey  I don't know you but you know my friend joe says that he's been talking to you about this then  
**[1:22:45-1:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:22:45):**  pretty soon you get to know tim just as well and you know you start you start getting a lot more  a lot more open net type of policy where you have a larger larger community to ask questions to so it  kind of takes that anytime you can kind of shave that learning experiences off it's a good thing so  
**[1:23:05-1:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:23:05):**  we're all about being lifelong learners and and never never stop learning you know it's  it's something that really sets a lot of us apart in a regenerative agriculture sphere because  we're always looking for a better way to do things and with that I think that's a great place to end  
**[1:23:22-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/25-Michael-Thompson-Stop-Farming-in-a-Flower-Pot-e15l0b8#t=1:23:22):**  michael we sure appreciate your time today ck you've been over there awful quiet anything to add  real quick no but i could just see why you're so good with kindergartners though because  you just have the energy this whole time and it's been it's been really good so well i i really feel

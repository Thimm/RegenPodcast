**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:15):**  I thought I had one saved in the can that I was going to edit this evening because we're  going to go away for the weekend.  And that wasn't the case.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:22):**  So fortunately Ben was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk with  me this evening.  So Ben, welcome to the show.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:33):**  Thank you.  Glad to be here.  So you mentioned that you were on Working Cows.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:38):**  That's Clay Connery's fantastic podcast.  I'm pretty sure that nobody that listens to this one needs me to give a shout out to Working  Cows, but there it is.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:46):**  What episode was that?  I don't remember that one.  Oh boy, I think it was, I want to say episode 134 for some reason.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:01:57):**  I might be wrong, but that sticks out in my memory for some reason.  Yeah, it's probably close enough.  I can go.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:02:04):**  I'll look that up.  I'll make sure that gets in the show notes.  Because it's a short notice, CK can't join us tonight.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:02:11):**  So it's just us guys.  In your email, you were telling me about how you're from the Nebraska Sandhills.  You want to start there and start talking about the Sandhills?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:02:24):**  Sure.  Well, the Sandhills are the largest vegetated sand dune area in the Western Hemisphere.  And they're the largest area of intact prairie east of the Rockies.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:02:41):**  And so the Sandhills covers about 25,000 square miles, or about a quarter of the state of  Nebraska, mostly in the north central to northwestern part.  And I grew up on a ranch there.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:02:55):**  I was, I had a fourth generation there.  And my great grandfather and his brother were sharecroppers in northeast Nebraska until  the mid 30s, when the drought and the Dust Bowl all that all those years, and then they  
**[0:03:16-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:03:16):**  auctioned off their farm equipment and, and drove their cattle from northeast Nebraska  to a ranch in the Sandhills that they basically bought on a handshake from an army buddy.  Wow.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:03:32):**  Like how far was that?  That's, it's about 100, what what they actually drove them somewhere between 100 and 125 miles.  They drove them across the country through that was legit cross country, right?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:03:48):**  Cattle drive.  Yeah.  horses, wagons, the whole bit.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:03:51):**  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:03:54):**  And they made it to the Atkinson livestock market stockyards there in Atkinson where  my hometown is in November, and spent the night in the in the sale barn office.  It was the first time they'd slept inside in several weeks.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:04:13):**  So  those guys that went on the cattle drives, they were they were tough men.  Because look pretty weak, mean, mean air conditioning, heated seats and pickups.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:04:24):**  Yeah.  It wasn't as epic as Lonesome Dove, but it was a it was a cattle drive.  Nonetheless, it's a good story to tell about how we got started with ranching.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:04:34):**  And then we, that family just raised cattle from then on.  And my, my grandpa on my mom's side and his brothers started or operated a sale barn in  Burwell, Nebraska.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:04:51):**  And then they moved to Atkinson and bought the one in Atkinson.  And my dad's father, my grandpa was the order buyer there.  And my mom's mom ran the Stockman cafe in the sale barn.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:06):**  So we've been pretty tied up in the beef cattle world there in that community for for a while.  So  very cool.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:15):**  Very cool.  Our last guest was actually Chris Redmond from the Sandhills.  I think he was up by up around Valentine.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:23):**  But he's on one of Turner's ranches up there.  But he's actually funny as a funny enough as it is, I set that episode to upload.  And then I had to take off to go to executive Lincoln and I figured I'd see Chris there  
**[0:05:37-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:37):**  because we're in the same chapter.  Well, we were he like two weeks ago, he left Turner to take another job.  And it was kind of all those just things.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:48):**  And I asked, I asked him good night is kind of replacement said, thanks, Eric.  Okay.  Yeah, they went fine.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:05:56):**  So that's that's kind of interesting history in the beef business.  Did your family put in a bunkhouse there at the sale barn for anybody that might be traveling  through in memory of grandpa?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:06:08):**  I know, they, they, they eventually got out of that business.  Although my my uncle, my great uncle was an auctioneer there for a while my in my grandpa  was the order buyer there.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:06:22):**  It had pretty much his whole life.  But but yeah, and we, we had where our ranch is located.  Historically was the kind of the end of the road.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:06:37):**  And so they put in a big, they put in a big corral and a series of working pens and a  scale.  And a lot of the neighbors that live further south of us would drive their cattle to our  
**[0:06:50-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:06:50):**  place to weigh them and load them if they didn't just drive them to town.  And so our place was kind of Grand Central Station for a while.  And grew up right there with the road running right through the middle.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:07:07):**  So we had it kind of split our ranch in half.  Okay.  So in the email, and we're kind of email back and forth over the last couple days,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:07:18):**  you mentioned something about dairy.  And you've been talking about beef, you know, primarily beef cattle from that side of it,  you know, in a sale barn.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:07:25):**  So how did you how did your family go from being displaced in the 30s to come into the  Atkinson Nebraska area to establish in the Sandhills, buy a sale barn and then get into  the dairy business?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:07:38):**  Well they always I mean, they were old fashioned homesteader types, I guess you might say and  they always milked a cow or two to keep the family in milk.  And you know, one of the ways they basically survived the depression was, you know, taking  
**[0:07:54-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:07:54):**  cream and butter and taking it to town and selling it.  And so then that it was just kind of that family milk cow scale for a while.  And then in 1985, my dad decided to diversify the ranch a little bit and built a dairy parlor  
**[0:08:13-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:08:13):**  and started milking cows.  The 80s that was right in the middle of the 80s farm crisis.  And so there was actually a lot of dairies going out of business and he was able to put  
**[0:08:24-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:08:24):**  together a decent cow herd of milk cows and and everybody told me it's crazy, you know,  he, he, why would you get into milking cows right now?  You know, and, but he did it and he, he, you know, he milked cows for 30 years there.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:08:43):**  And so that was kind of when I when I was old enough to start helping out.  You know, it was there was the beef cattle side of things too.  But milking cows was one of my jobs and feeding the calves.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:08:56):**  And so my dad told me when I was nine, you know, if you help help do the chores and milk  the cows for a year, I'll pay you in a calf.  So I did that for a year and he paid me in a calf and they said now you got to pay me  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:09:14):**  to keep her until she's milking.  So you got to milk some more.  I milked for a few, a couple more years and then she calved and then she was milking.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:09:23):**  They said all right, now you got to keep track of what she's what she's given and how much  she's producing and you got and if she can produce more than your feed costs and all  that and you're bored, then you can get a paycheck from this cow.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:09:35):**  And so, lo and behold, she did.  So I started saving some money and started buying more.  And by the time I was a senior in high school, I had a pretty decent sized herd of cows that  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:09:46):**  that I was milking.  And then I went to college.  And then what happened?  
**[0:09:54-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:09:54):**  Well, I went to college and I got a degree in English.  And then shortly after that, I went and got a master's degree in poetry and then came  back to Nebraska and was a college English professor for about three years teaching literature  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:10:10):**  and creative writing.  What happened to your cows when you went to college?  They were still there.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:10:17):**  They were still there.  I still kept them and would sell extra ones and dad basically milked them and he got all  the income from that and I managed the genetics and some of the decisions on them.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:10:33):**  But we just kind of had a because he was running a working dairy.  It was basically, I guess you might say kind of an equity partner where I had the cows  and he and my brother and I was back there in the summertime a lot helping.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:10:51):**  Pretty good succession planning, actually.  Pretty early buy in at nine.  Yeah, yeah, I got started early.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:11:00):**  I was, I don't know, maybe I was the world's youngest share milker at that time.  I don't know.  So if you're, if you're still making all kinds of genetics and breeding calls from college  
**[0:11:12-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:11:12):**  and you know, as you're going off in the world to teach English, what kind of cows are we  talking about here?  Well, so when I first started, you know, I had a goal of, you know, basically being the  
**[0:11:28-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:11:28):**  top production herd in the state of Nebraska, which I actually did.  I did have some very strong milking cows that were making like national Hall of Fame records  and I did have the, you know, highest production herd, but it just kind of wasn't really that  
**[0:11:46-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:11:46):**  profitable.  I mean, we, you know, there in the late nineties, the dairy industry kind of had another squeeze.  There was a lot of consolidation and that was kind of when Dairy Farmers of America,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:11:57):**  DFA, which is now the largest co-op in the country.  They kind of squeezed out who we had been selling milk to.  And you know, we couldn't, we really were faced with that choice of get big or get out.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:12:13):**  And we just decided to, we had been hearing some things about grass fed dairy production  and some things about organic dairy production.  And so my dad just decided that we were going to make that switch and start basically selling  
**[0:12:30-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:12:30):**  selling raw milk and value added products instead of commodity milk.  And so when we made that decision, the genetics followed basically out of necessity.  Like we soon found that the conventional American Holstein and even some of the, you know, even  
**[0:12:49-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:12:49):**  the jerseys were, they just couldn't handle that type of management, you know, with where  they weren't getting grain.  And so we pretty much kind of called out anything that really wasn't making it and started using  
**[0:13:03-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:13:03):**  some New Zealand genetics because the, you know, the New Zealanders were milking on grass  based systems and, you know, focusing a lot on things like fertility and butterfat percent.  There's a whole lot of grain farming going on in New Zealand, and they don't think they  
**[0:13:20-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:13:20):**  import anything.  Yeah, so, so they, so we use some of those bulls.  And then we also just started saving some of our own bulls, because with the ranch background  
**[0:13:32-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:13:32):**  that we had, you know, they, my grandpa had raised, they raised register horned Hereford's  for a long time and had, you know, and had used some, you know, they had some of the  old lens anxiety for line bread, lamplighter stuff.  
**[0:13:47-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:13:47):**  And so we just kind of like, we weren't afraid to use our own bulls, even though most people  said, you know, you couldn't use your own bulls, because you wouldn't make enough genetic  progress or, or dairy bulls are crazy, and they'll kill you and stuff like that.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:14:03):**  We just, you know, we were used to having bulls around and so we just ran them, ran  them basically just like a beaver.  You know, we, we had never really gone full into the conventional model of confinement  
**[0:14:14-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:14:14):**  dairy farming, you know, our cattle had always been out on pasture, we raised our heifers,  we back grounded them with the beef, beef cattle.  Basically we just treated them like beef cattle until they came in the parlor when we gave  
**[0:14:27-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:14:27):**  them a pellet ration and milked them.  So making the transition from a management standpoint, wasn't that tough, but the when  you took, when we took the grain away, that was when we really had to start focusing on  
**[0:14:40-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:14:40):**  genetics and so and it eventually evolved into using our own bulls and raising the bulls  out of our best cows and just kind of doing what we had to do to produce the kind of cow  that would produce milk in our environment.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:14:55):**  How bad did everything crash when you took away their grain?  Like the fertility crash, body condition crash?  Body condition went down, fertility, you know, they wouldn't breed back.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:15:08):**  You know, it would, you saw the most, you saw it most in the heifers, the heifers would  look about the same and then they would calve and then they just wouldn't breed back for  their second lactation.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:15:23):**  They just couldn't milk and breed back at the same time.  So yeah, we had, we had a lot of heifer attrition, high rate of heifer attrition.  And so, you know, we basically had to, had to start from scratch, pretty much with the  
**[0:15:45-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:15:45):**  genetics, although some of the, there was a few of the cows that did fine.  And it was actually a Jersey cow of mine that kind of gave dad the idea because she wouldn't  eat grain.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:02):**  She was, she was just a weird cow and she wouldn't come in.  She, when she came into the barn, she wouldn't eat the grain.  And she would, when we turned them out into the, into the stanchion barn to, to give them  
**[0:16:14-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:14):**  their feed, you know, in the middle of the day, we would give them a scoop of grain then.  And she wouldn't come in and do that.  She would just go out and graze.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:25):**  And she was actually production wise and in butterfat total pounds, the highest three  year old producing cow in the state of Nebraska that year, the year she was a four, three  or four year old.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:38):**  And so that was what really got the wheels turning for us to say, wow, you can actually  have cows that will do this.  How do we get more cows like that one?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:47):**  And we just kind of forgot about the rest of them.  And so we started trying to get genetics like that, that one cow that we have that could  do it.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:16:58):**  Sometimes that's all it takes is just one really, really awesome cow, but you gotta  be able to find that one and sometimes separating the wheat from the chaff, you know, you gotta,  you gotta make a drastic change.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:17:09):**  You know, pull it all the way, pull in the way, all the inputs out from under them and  you'll, you'll find the ones that can succeed on your program and your environment.  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:17:18):**  Really fast.  Yeah.  So, but you're not in Nebraska anymore on the dairy area.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:17:24):**  No, no.  So I moved, I'm actually now living in Freeport, Maine, which is right on the coast of Maine,  about 20 minutes north or up the coast from Portland.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:17:37):**  And I moved here a little over a year ago, November of 2020.  So now I am the dairy manager at a place called Wolf's Neck Center for the agriculture and  the environment.  
**[0:17:51-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:17:51):**  And it's a nonprofit farm that is mostly a training, a farmer training, apprentice training  and a research farm that also has a few hundred coastal campsites.  So it's, there's, you know, camping, agritourism, tourism, farm visitors, and then education.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:18:15):**  It runs a lot of, they run a lot of youth and, and in school age education programs  here where they teach, you know, little classes about growing food and dairy farming and,  you know, soil carbon and things like that.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:18:36):**  So it's, it's a really interesting place where there's a lot of things going on and a lot  of really talented people doing some really interesting work.  So you're the dairy manager, like, what, from what you're describing earlier, obviously,  
**[0:18:54-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:18:54):**  you know, you're working at, you know, a small family dairy, but maybe I'm missing something.  So what exactly does a dairy manager do?  Are you, you know, still doing basically what every other dairyman in the world does?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:19:05):**  Or are you just overseeing the people that work in milking barns?  Yes, so I, I still milk the cows, feed the cows, put up hay, you know, do all the stuff.  And, but I have anywhere between, I think I have as few as two at one time, but in as  
**[0:19:24-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:19:24):**  many as four apprentices that are here through the dairy grazing apprenticeship program.  You, you did an episode with Joe Tomando.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:19:35):**  So anybody that's interested in that program, I can't explain the vision of that any better  than he can.  But that is the program where we're working with here is the DGA.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:19:44):**  And so right now, I have three apprentices.  And so there's a, there's, there's a pretty good amount of shared labor.  I mean, it's not, it's the size of the farm.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:19:56):**  You know, it's a, it's, we're milking, you know, we milk bounce around anywhere between  30 and 40 cows.  It's a, it's a single family scale, you know, farm that's, that would probably be supported  
**[0:20:11-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:20:11):**  by, you know, one or one and a half, maybe two labor units in the, you know, in, in,  in the quote unquote, real world.  But but yeah, so I'm overseeing supervising teaching, and just basically helping young  
**[0:20:29-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:20:29):**  and beginning dairy grazing apprentices to complete the program and, and move on to whatever  the next step might look for them.  For those that are interested, that was Episode 21 with Joe Tomando about the Dairy Grazer  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:20:48):**  Association.  I'll make sure I get a link for that in the show notes.  So you also mentioned that you're an organic dairy, correct?  
**[0:20:57-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:20:57):**  Yes, this is a certified organic dairy.  And in fact, Wolf's Neck was, is one of the oldest certified organic farms in the country.  And for a long time, they, they were a beef ranch.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:21:09):**  And they they had a private label beef brand that they distributed throughout New England,  called Wolf's Neck organic beef.  And I mean, this was, this was back when, I mean, this is back in the 60s and 70s, you  
**[0:21:23-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:21:23):**  know, before there was even a national organic program.  Right.  So it's been it's been under organic management continuously for a very long time.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:21:35):**  What's the forage chain like for for an organic dairy up there?  I mean, you're pretty far north and you're right on the coast.  And from what I know of Maine, like the winters aren't really the best in the world, lots  
**[0:21:50-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:21:50):**  of snow.  We don't get quite as much snow, because we're on the coast.  So you know that we have our winters are I mean, even if you just drive a half an hour  
**[0:22:01-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:01):**  inland, their winters are much more severe.  I mean, we are literally on the coast, like most of our pastures, you know, you could  stand at the fence line and throw a baseball into the Atlantic Ocean.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:12):**  I mean, it is on the coast.  That's on the coast.  And the farm is split in half by a tidal estuary that at high tide is completely full of water  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:24):**  and just about to the bridge.  And you know, low tide, it's like mud flats across, there's guys out there digging for  clams.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:32):**  So I mean, it is on the coast.  So it's the pastures are, I mean, it's heavy marine clay, and saltwater marsh and coastal  wetlands with with, you know, with pine tree forest and oak forest and rock ledge, there's  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:51):**  the high ground isn't really like what you would think of as high ground.  It's mostly rock.  They call it ledge out here.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:22:57):**  It's like rock outcropping.  And so we water management looks a lot different here than it did in the Nebraska Sandhills  where you could pour out a gallon of water and it would be gone in two seconds.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:23:11):**  Here, we have to deal with wet, very wet soil.  And so the grasses, we have a lot, some of our pastures have a lot of reed canary grass,  like a lot, a lot of it.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:23:26):**  You know, we have some meadow foxtail.  But some of our improved ground, you know, we've got some we've got some orchard grass  and red clover and white clover, things like that coming in.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:23:39):**  And we have done some research on on some alternative forages.  Because because like I said earlier, part of what this farm does is research.  And so they they have their part of a program.  
**[0:23:51-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:23:51):**  They're one of the farm hubs for an organization called open team, which is stands for I got  open technology ecosystem for agriculture management.  So basically, they do like soil carbon, remote monitoring, they have like record keeping  
**[0:24:12-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:24:12):**  platforms and this is all like open source software.  And so, you know, we do we've done some test plots with different forages and measured  different things.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:24:24):**  And I kind of get to be a part of that on the periphery.  But you know, if when it comes to managing the pasture or or, you know, then then I'm  involved, but, you know, so a lot of the research that's done is, is driven by grants.  
**[0:24:43-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:24:43):**  And so, but, you know, there's also an open ear for like, if the farmer has an idea about  something to study, you know, we can we kind of have an, an outlet there where where we  can probably do something.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:00):**  Some interesting projects here in the future.  For sure, for sure.  So what what's your forage chain look like?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:09):**  Like, and kind of what's a day in the life of a cow at wolf's neck look like, you know,  like some of the other episodes, like my friend Lloyd born Traeger 19.  He's got, you know, his cows spend most of their day out grazing in pastures behind polly  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:27):**  fire, and he's got to run lanes.  Sean Smith, I think he, I can't remember.  But you know, there's various schemes.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:36):**  So what does it look like at wolf's neck?  So during the growing season, we keep the cows outside, they, we have a road that runs  through the middle of the farm.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:48):**  And so most of our higher quality dairy pastures are on the other side of that road from the  milking facility.  So every morning, at you know, five o'clock, we go out and gather the cows, we have a lane  
**[0:25:59-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:25:59):**  system.  So we have, you know, the those acres are divided into into permanent paddocks.  And then we have a lane that runs along basically along the road.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:26:11):**  And then there's a crossing, we bring them across, we we milk them.  Right This is this is a grain fed operation, which we're working, you know, that's one  of the reasons that I'm here is is to transition to at least a low grain, low cost, lower input,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:26:32):**  lower cost scenario with with the goal of going completely grass fed if if if possible.  So so we bring them in across the road, they come into the into the pack barn where we  have a feed alley, we give them a couple scoops of grain,  
**[0:26:53-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:26:53):**  put them in the part in the in the holding pen, milk them, let them back out, work them  up, hey, give them as much hay, you know, dry hay as they want.  And then as soon as we're done cleaning up the parlor and everything, we cross them back  
**[0:27:06-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:27:06):**  out, out the road, cross the road again and put them back out on pasture.  And so we'll move them usually will you move them no more than twice, sometimes only once  a day and rotate them to fresh pasture every day.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:27:20):**  And then, you know that in the growing season, the heifers are all on pasture.  This year, we did not feed that any of the heifers grain on pasture, you know, once they  were weaned, they were they were on pasture.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:27:33):**  And this time of year, basically for the last two weeks, when it's starting to get cold,  and you get that cold driving rain, and it's, it's just muddy.  I mean, there's just nothing but mud out there and standing water in the paddocks.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:27:50):**  There is some standing forage out there.  But we just leave it.  That's our that's our we leave that for for next spring.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:28:00):**  And so we bring the cows in and we put them on a pack there on a bedded pack that's bedded  with wood shavings or sawdust.  So now we bring the cows up to the feed alley, we till the pack, let them in the holding  
**[0:28:14-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:28:14):**  pins, scrape the alleyway, milk them, let them back out.  And then we unroll baleage that's native baleage that we put up here on this farm.  And with the addition of the of the grain ration, which we are now supplementing with  
**[0:28:29-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:28:29):**  beet pulp.  So we basically cut our grain starch ration in half.  And we're now substituting that with beet pulp.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:28:38):**  So so we're cutting back on the on the pelletized feed, which is kind of your inorganic and  then conventional probably too, it's it's the high it's kind of the high dollar stuff.  So we're trying to get get away from that.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:28:55):**  And then the beet pulp, we've been able to basically cut the cut the grain in half and  substitute that with beet pulp.  And so like I said, we till that bedded pack two or three times a day, we add fresh carbon  
**[0:29:11-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:29:11):**  or wood to it.  Usually, I mean, it can be as often as every other day, depending on the situation, but  we also try to let the cows out during the daytime as much as we can.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:29:26):**  And so we will roll unroll bales out on on a on a pasture, we'll pick a paddock.  And we have some paddocks that are closer to the barn that are not dairy quality that  we don't use for the milk cows during the growing season.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:29:42):**  But we'll stockpile a little on there.  And then when the ground freezes, we'll let them out in there and feed them feed them  baleage and or or whatever out on the ground.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:29:51):**  And then they'll be out of outside even even on snow.  For you know, two to four hours a day.  So that helps keep that bedded pack dry.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:30:03):**  We'll till that a couple times during those days to keep the moisture, you know, to keep  it evaporating and to keep keep it aerated.  And so then they're on that bedded pack till we go back out to pasture late April, early  
**[0:30:16-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:30:16):**  May.  And then we compost that pack further and spread it out on the usually on the hay ground,  but also on some of the grazing paddocks.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:30:27):**  I was gonna ask what you did with the bedded pack and how long that lasted.  You mentioned you turned it three times a day.  How do you do that?  
**[0:30:36-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:30:36):**  So we, we have a sea tooth harrow on the back of a 3600 Ford tractor.  And we, we just basically we get to play Zen garden, we go out there and just till it till  it in concentric circles or figure eights, the apprentices all kind of have their favorite  
**[0:30:55-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:30:55):**  pattern that they like to you.  But it's, I tell them, you know, we call it farm in the arena, kind of an old rodeo term,  but we are not a wrong way to do it.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:31:06):**  Let's make it look just drive around in circles and drive.  If you miss a spot, drive over, you know, and try not to drop your cell phone in there  because you know, be in there.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:31:18):**  So yeah, so we tell it and then we also do have a roto tiller.  And we'll put that like just regular garden roto tiller that would go behind a tractor.  And we'll put that on a on a larger tractor and really do a deep till on it.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:31:35):**  Usually once a week or every couple weeks just to really turn it and get really deep  down because that harrow gets down about six to eight inches.  But that roto tiller will really, really turn the bottom stuff up.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:31:48):**  And then it really steams when it's cold out.  I imagine it's pretty thick by the end of winter.  By the end of winter when we were cleaning it out, you know, when we started cleaning  
**[0:31:58-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:31:58):**  it out in June, we, it was about 40 inches thick, almost four feet deep.  And so we didn't clean it out completely at that time.  We because we were bringing the cows in and milk them twice a day, there's some not slurry  
**[0:32:23-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:32:23):**  but like manure from the feed alley and the holding pen and all that.  So basically when we would scrape that out, we would mix a couple bucket loads of that  kind of composted pack bedding with that, and then compost that even more.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:32:41):**  And so we got a little extra life out of it, you know, for that reason, because then it  helped us with stacking.  If we needed to stage manure in areas where we wanted to spread it later.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:32:53):**  So you don't have a pit system?  No.  Okay, how does that work?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:32:59):**  We spread manure all the time.  Okay.  And compost it so that it's so that it's we get more value from it.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:33:08):**  Okay.  And I think I understand some of the science of why you don't want manure in a pit with  urine.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:33:16):**  Can you can you explain that a little bit?  Well it's volatile, you know, liquid manure is volatile.  So you got nitrous oxide in your ammonia gases, they're just gassing off in a liquid pit.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:33:30):**  And then it's also hard to manage.  And I don't think this farm could have got a permit to put in a lagoon.  I mean, we are we're  
**[0:33:38-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:33:38):**  You're on the Atlantic Ocean.  We're yeah, I mean, it in that soil, you know, it's the water table is really high.  And I just above ground liquid manure storage would not have ever happened here.  
**[0:33:51-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:33:51):**  I don't think.  Okay, that makes sense.  I was, isn't there some difference between anaerobic and aerobic decomposition in cattle  
**[0:34:04-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:34:04):**  manure?  Like a cow pie in the pasture or a cow pile in the field is going to decompose differently  than that manures decomposing in the manure pit, correct?  
**[0:34:16-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:34:16):**  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it, it'll  that manure, it'll, it'll, it'll kind of start to heat up without adding much carbon to it.  But when you know, when we're stirring up the carbon, and stirring up those wood chips,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:34:34):**  and we also have, because there's a lot of forestry and timber in Maine, we have access  to we can get wood ash, which kind of looks like charcoal dust.  And it has it has a liming effect.  
**[0:34:50-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:34:50):**  So basically, think of what you would do with lime where you're at.  That's what we do with wood ash here.  And so you know, we, you can, we've mixed a little bit of that in with our compost and  
**[0:35:03-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:35:03):**  with our manure, usually right before we spread it.  But you know, our goal, our goal with our manure management is to keep the cows outside  on pasture as much as possible for one and you know, with rotations and keeping them  
**[0:35:18-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:35:18):**  moving across the farm, but then to never have any liquid manure anywhere, always be  mixing that manure with some form of carbon.  Some, you know, whether that's just what regular wood mulch or the wood chip shavings bedding  
**[0:35:35-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:35:35):**  that we get for the barn.  I must be doing some amazing things for some soil.  Well, we have pretty good recovery rates, you know, the  
**[0:35:50-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:35:50):**  If I wanted to, I could probably run my cows on a 12 to 15 day rotation here.  But our goal has been this past season.  And again, I'm still new here.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:36:03):**  I mean, this was my first grazing season here this last season.  So I'm learning a lot as I go.  But my goal was to not do that.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:36:13):**  My goal was to kind of have it at, you know, about about 30 days.  And early in the season, you know, we were moving really quick trying to knock back that  meadow foxtail, because it was just exploding everywhere all at once.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:36:31):**  And so what what I found here, as opposed to where I was in Nebraska, we can move them  fast here.  I mean, you can, you can top it, take the top third of it off and move them, you know,  
**[0:36:47-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:36:47):**  you can just about cover your whole farm if you move them quick in two weeks, you know,  move them come around every two weeks.  But we found that about 30 days between 25 and 30 days was just right for this past season.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:37:04):**  And then we did stockpile some and rest some out further.  And then we had kind of the option to graze it or hay it.  Sometimes some of those times we did hay it some of those times we did graze it.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:37:16):**  But it was nice to have that option.  Because in July, we didn't put up any hay, it was so wet here in July, that we could  not even you couldn't even get a mower out in the in the field.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:37:30):**  So we didn't put up any hay in July.  And we graze we graze several of our hay fields with our young stock and our dry cows.  Because you can you can get out there.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:37:44):**  Too wet to be in the pasture in July, like are too wet to hay in July, like that won't  compute for probably 90% of the people that live.  I've never seen such a thing in my life.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:37:56):**  I mean, we, we would get some so our ranch in Nebraska had sub irrigated hay meadows.  And there was times in my childhood where like, you know, Memorial Day weekend, we get  a big storm.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:38:07):**  And you could paddle a canoe across our hay meadow, but never in July, like never that  late in the year.  And so yeah, I was I was stunned.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:38:16):**  You know, I, my, I had, I got a mower tractor with flotation tires on it.  And I was scared to death to take that thing out there.  What are some other weather challenges that you weren't ready for coming from the Sand  
**[0:38:33-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:38:33):**  Hills to coastal Maine?  One nice thing is it's not as windy.  Like it's just you get that constant wind in the Sand Hills, which I don't mind that  
**[0:38:43-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:38:43):**  but it was it's very noticeable.  And you know, on the colder days of the winter, without that wind, you just don't get quite  that same biting cold, but it's high humidity.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:38:56):**  So you have you know, you have that high humidity cold, where you know, it's it just gets in  your bones and just just it soaks all the way down to your bones.  Yeah, stay there all day to get out.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:39:09):**  So I would say I would say all seasonal all season, the high humidity is tough.  You know, and we get that we get we get ocean spray, we get saltwater spray, you know, sometimes  in the middle of the day, it'll just look like the rain storms coming in and it's just  
**[0:39:26-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:39:26):**  saltwater spray coming on off the ocean.  So that's that's different.  But I would say the mud, that you know, the the heavy soil in the mud, and just like the  
**[0:39:40-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:39:40):**  the just the difference in water infiltration.  And and there's there's good water holding seems like there's good water holding capacity,  but not good infiltration.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:39:53):**  I don't know if that makes any sense.  Like the clip the soil gets saturated.  It's not like it's not soaking up water, but then it's just like it's done.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:40:00):**  Is it more of a clay clay soil?  Oh, yeah, it's heavy clay.  Yeah, like, yeah, that makes sense why it would reach that really real fast, really  
**[0:40:09-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:40:09):**  fine, silty clay like the clay that I was used to back in southeastern Nebraska was  really it would fracture.  So it would crack and water would infiltrate really well.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:40:22):**  This clay is just really, really fine silt.  That's probably not very much fun when it turns to mud either.  No, probably no bottom all the way down.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:40:36):**  Yeah.  What's the summer like up there?  Very mild.  
**[0:40:41-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:40:41):**  They, you know, the our hottest days here were like 85 degrees.  But some of those days, you know, we had 90 90% of humidity, but it's still you know,  the for the majority of the summertime, the days were, you know, mid 70s, low 80s, maybe.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:02):**  And just really, I thought it was very pleasant.  It wasn't very good hay drying weather.  So we do a lot of we do a lot of high moisture hay, and we wrap a lot of hay.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:12):**  It's I got real familiar with what a hay tetter is.  But yeah, I was not used to not being able to dry hay in two or three days.  Never at all.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:24):**  I mean, it just seemed like if you didn't get dry hay put up before the sun went down,  it was going to soak up all the moisture from the air and the ground and it was going to  be you'd have to have to wait another two days.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:37):**  So we just basically wrap a lot of our hay even if it's down to like 25 30% moisture,  we still we don't we don't try to dry it out anymore because it just you can't wait around  that long.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:52):**  Whenever really gets above 85 and it's always humid and you live on the coast, it probably  be hard to keep anything dry.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:41:59):**  Yeah, dry firewood is a hot commodity.  Well, I was sitting here thinking and you mentioned salt spray and that got me really  thinking, I'm a big fan of Steve Campbell.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:42:14):**  And he he likes to push.  He likes to say that you should be using an ancient sequestered source of salt for your  cattle.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:42:24):**  Like the two he mentions our Kansas independent salt from Kanopolis and the C 90 product,  which will disclosure that's what I use a little bit of.  And the theory behind that is, is, you know, it's the perfect balance of water soluble  
**[0:42:41-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:42:41):**  bioavailable minerals that you know, that basically life needs.  And I've heard of people taking saltwater, you know, making their own sea saltwater from,  you know, either Kansas independent or seen idea or an equivalent product, making seawater  
**[0:43:00-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:43:00):**  and going and spraying it on pastures in order to raise the bricks level of the pastures.  So I'm, I'm wondering if, if your forage, you know, there is is great on the coast because  it's getting some of that salt spray and it's a little bit higher in sugar.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:43:19):**  So I'm wondering what would happen if you took like just some of your pasture grass  and took it inside without where it couldn't work.  It still gets sunshine, but it wasn't getting any of the salt spray and see what would happen  
**[0:43:32-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:43:32):**  with with the bricks and the nutrient levels in the grass.  Yeah, it would be interesting.  I mean, if this farm when there was a beef operation used to do a little bit of that  
**[0:43:45-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:43:45):**  where they would, they would harvest on their on their finishing cattle, they would they  would harvest the grass and and basically kind of try it down somewhat in a static pile  and then feed it, feed it directly to those cattle, basically with them with a feed wagon.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:06):**  And so they did some things like that.  And I, I need to get, you know, more familiar with the history here, because they were doing  this farm has always kind of done different things, you know, innovative things.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:23):**  And you know, there I've heard some stories about their feeding.  So they were basically grass finishing cattle in a feedlot situation.  That makes any sense.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:34):**  Like they were harvesting fresh grass and taking it to their finishing cattle.  That's it.  It's a thing.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:43):**  It's a thing.  People do it.  It's a thing.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:46):**  So yeah, but I don't know what would happen if you like dried it down, like it's solar  drying.  But it does have a it does have a very distinct smell, a different smell with a grass baleage  
**[0:44:59-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:44:59):**  that we make here than the baleage that I'm used to back in Nebraska.  So yeah, it's it's I haven't done enough research and enough testing to know what all the differences  might be.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:45:14):**  But you know, it I wouldn't doubt that the salty air and I mean, there will there is  salt you can taste it when you know when that sea spray, you get it on your face, you can  lick your lips and it tastes like salt.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:45:28):**  So I wouldn't doubt that that has if there is an effect to be had from salt, I don't  wouldn't doubt that there is one with the cattle eating that grass.  What I remember from salt spray all my days on boats, it just makes everything slippery.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:45:47):**  rust out all your vehicles and equipment instantly, like instantly.  Yeah.  So do you still have cows on the on the family dairy ranch back in Nebraska?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:45:59):**  I actually brought my cow herd here to Maine with me.  So they're there at Wolf's Neck with you?  Yes.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:46:06):**  So basically, I'm running two separate herds here.  So we've got the Wolf's Neck dairy herd on one side of the river.  And then on the other side of the river, we've got the whole creek jerseys.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:46:15):**  And they're managed completely differently.  I mean, they're they're still 100% grass bed, still organically managed, but they are not  they're not getting any grain and never have.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:46:28):**  And you know, they're I'm raising, I raise my calves on cows.  And and we know, you know, much later age.  And so I'm doing a little different thing with my personal herd here.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:46:45):**  We always raised the calves, I shouldn't say always, but for last 15 years, we've raised  our calves and our dairy herd on nurse cows.  And we tried the we tried the calf sharing thing, or it's also called the Madre method  
**[0:46:59-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:46:59):**  where you raise a calf, raise the calf on her dam and milk the dam, we just didn't find  that we liked that management system.  So what we ended up doing was we would take half of the herd, and they would be the nurse  
**[0:47:13-0:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:47:13):**  cows, and we would take the calves from the milking herd and put them on the nurse cows.  So every nurse cow would raise two calves.  And then we would basically just run them like a beef herd.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:47:25):**  I call them my cow calf calf trios.  So I ran a cow calf calf herd.  And they so they went, they were on separate rotation on another part of the farm.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:47:37):**  And that's basically what I decided to do here.  Because when I moved here last November, my wife and our daughter stayed in Nebraska for  a couple months.  
**[0:47:46-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:47:46):**  And so rather than have her have to manage the dairy, the you know, at that time, we  were running kind of a raw milk micro dairy.  We've milked cows at various scales throughout the years, but at that time, we were running  
**[0:48:02-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:02):**  a very small micro dairy sold mainly raw milk right off the farm.  And so when those cows dried up for the winter, and I was out here before, you know, we just  decided, when these cows calving in the spring, we're just going to let them raise their their  
**[0:48:19-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:19):**  own calf, we're not even going to try and milk them when they get out here to Maine,  which was a good idea, because we didn't end up being able to bring them out here till  May.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:30):**  And so half of them had capped already, the other cap, the other word spring and we had  one calf born on the semi on the way out here.  So it was never ideal.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:40):**  Yeah, it was a true.  It was just what worked out for us that we wouldn't have chosen to do it that way.  But but it just kind of how things work to halt.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:51):**  I mean, it's to find a trucker that was coming through Nebraska that was coming that would  come to Maine.  I mean, it was an 1800 mile trip for them cows.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:48:59):**  And, you know, the guy that was born on the trailer, he's, he's running around kicking  still, he's, he's doing great.  But we will be delicious someday.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:49:10):**  Yeah, we may we made them adapt, for sure.  But we just weaned, we just weaned the heifers that were born in the spring this week.  So they're, they're doing, they're doing pretty good.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:49:24):**  We're happy with how they turned out after that move.  Okay, that's, that's great that you got to bring your cows there.  What so what's the wolf's neck dairy herd look like?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:49:36):**  Well, they have the it's predominantly Holstein, what I would describe as very large Holsteins,  what I would not describe as a grass type cow.  And so kind of the first order of business when I arrived was to kind of create an implement  
**[0:49:56-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:49:56):**  start implementing a breeding program, where, you know, we identified the goals of, you  know, what we wanted for, you know, what we wanted for production, what we wanted to be  managing for, and then just basically setting some parameters of like, what we were going  
**[0:50:11-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:50:11):**  to start doing.  And so we've started, you know, doing more strategic meetings through artificial breeding,  but then also running bull run on a jersey, a jersey bull with the heifers, and jersey  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:50:25):**  started Holstein heifers.  Yes.  Oh, like every every other dairy guy listening to this is probably getting ready to throw  
**[0:50:32-0:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:50:32):**  a pitchfork.  Well, they actually make some really decent cows.  We when when we switched to grass fed, and my dad had Holsteins, and I had jerseys, he  
**[0:50:44-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:50:44):**  could see pretty quickly that he was going to have to do something different.  So he did run some jersey, he ran my jersey bulls on his Holsteins.  And those jersey Holstein crosses are amazing cows.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:50:58):**  They they, they give more milk than a jersey more butterfat than a Holstein.  And you know, they have a lot of hybrid vigor.  And you know, crossbreeding is a whole other thing that, you know, kind of a trail that  
**[0:51:13-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:51:13):**  you can go down and talk about the merits or the dangers of it.  But basically what what the goal of that was to decrease size, you know, I mean, because  some of these cows that were milking now, I mean, they weigh 1400 pounds.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:51:32):**  And they're not given that much more milk than some of the 900 pound jerseys.  They're eating twice as much feed, twice as much feed and taken up twice as much space.  So this barn, this pack barn is designed to basically hold, you know, up to if you managed  
**[0:51:52-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:51:52):**  it right 50 jerseys.  And when I showed up here in November, they had 60 of those 13 1400 pound Holsteins in  here and we and we're they were having a lot of trouble with hairy heel wart, a lot of  
**[0:52:10-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:52:10):**  lame cows, a lot of cows with staff mastitis, a lot of cows, not very many cows breeding  back.  So we just first order business to kind of clean up the herd and get rid of the stuff  
**[0:52:23-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:52:23):**  that was just we couldn't bear to keep them here anymore.  And then implement the breeding program, which like I said, running the Jersey bull with  the Holstein heifers, they did have some jerseys here, they had a small handful of jerseys.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:52:37):**  And so, you know, we're basically putting them through the same program.  We we ran the bull with them for 60 days.  I mean, I would run them, you know, for less if we were further along in the program, we'll  
**[0:52:54-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:52:54):**  probably like to, to cut that back a little to select for the ones that are going to breed  back earlier and cap earlier in the cycle, but we ran him for 60 days.  And that was that worked out pretty good for us.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:53:11):**  And we so now we have that portion, our replacement heifers are going to calve in the spring.  So we're kind of going to more of a semi seasonal, a dual season, you might say so spring calving  season, and a fall calving season.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:53:28):**  And I say fall calving, but it's really more like late summer, because I'm not so sure  that we want to be calving here in October.  Just because of the mud.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:53:38):**  I think I'd rather have them calved out by by Labor Day.  Whereas back home, I probably wouldn't even start till Labor Day on a fall calving cycle.  I always think it makes sense to be calving on your best forage.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:53:52):**  But you know, you see what's behind me.  I'm like, I live in the pasture.  Well, you know, that's an interesting thing.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:54:00):**  And I've had a lot of conversations about fall calving and dairies.  And so the conventional wisdom that you know, you always heard from the New Zealanders was  yeah, you want a cab in the spring, you want them to be in peak production when you have  
**[0:54:13-0:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:54:13):**  peak grass, so that you're producing the most milk when it's the cheapest to feed them.  And we played around.  So because we had a raw milk business, we, our customers always got mad at us.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:54:27):**  We did see, we did do seasonal milking for a while.  But we would, you know, our customers wanted milk through the winter.  And so instead of having them freeze it, which we tried that too, we would, we just had a  
**[0:54:42-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:54:42):**  fall calving herd that we would milk through the winter.  And we charged them kind of a winter milk premium.  You know, you want to have milk in the winter, you're gonna have to pay us a little more.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:54:54):**  And that was fine.  That went over pretty well.  But what we kind of an unintended consequence was, we found that the cows just the cows  
**[0:55:05-0:55:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:05):**  and the calves did so much better.  The calves, the calves, the fall calves that were born, would, would when you took them  through the winter on mom, and then you weaned them onto green grass, and they they just  
**[0:55:18-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:18):**  never looked back and they would by the time they were yearlings, they were they had caught  up to the ones that were six months older than them that were spring calves that were  18 months, they would catch them and they looked better too.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:30):**  They were they were fatter.  They weren't as big, they weren't quite as big, but they were fatter.  And they were just healthier in general.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:37):**  And the cows so so not as big but fatter is a good thing.  Yeah.  And so the cows so the cows you think, okay, we want these cows to be peaking at peat grass  
**[0:55:48-0:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:48):**  production.  But I actually kind of think of it the other way backwards.  Why not have your cows peaking in milk and producing the most milk when it costs the  
**[0:55:58-0:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:55:58):**  most to feed them, then you get more return on that feed dollar.  And then when you go into the grazing season, you see a lactation persistence.  So instead of having that peak where they drop off in the dry season, and then go into  
**[0:56:11-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:56:11):**  winter, you have a peak in the winter, and then they go out on spring grass, and they  sustain a higher level of production through the growing season.  And then they're dry in the dry part of the year.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:56:24):**  And there when the grass doesn't have quite as much, you know, when they're when it's  hotter and stuff with that actually worked better for us.  And if I was going to go back to a seasonal calving in a seasonal dairy, I would go fall  
**[0:56:37-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:56:37):**  seasonal.  And I would calve from Labor Day to the first of November, I'd dry them up on they'd be  dry by the Fourth of July, I'd go on vacation, and then I would come back and milk.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:56:49):**  You know, because there's worse places to be in than a dairy parlor milk and cows when  it's cold outside.  I mean, and there's probably worse places to be than a dairy parlor when it's like 100  
**[0:56:59-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:56:59):**  outside too.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, that's what I'm saying is in the fall, you know, the winter sorry, in the  
**[0:57:08-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:57:08):**  in the hot, hot part of the summer, you're not milking, you're not fighting the heat  and the flies milking them at that time of year.  You're just moving them on pasture.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:57:18):**  It makes sense.  I mean, it definitely makes sense the way you explained it.  I mean, I'm not a dairy guy, but you know, if you're, yeah, if you're just looking at  
**[0:57:28-0:57:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:57:28):**  it from like a beef perspective of what which system worked best for the calves, the calves  were always better for us out of the fall cows.  Always without fail, I thought that there was going to be a couple years where it would  
**[0:57:41-0:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:57:41):**  be the other way.  And it just never was.  Yeah, I mean, it, it makes sense.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:57:50):**  And you can't argue with somebody's data.  Is there still a goshaw ranch dairy farm back in Nebraska?  Is anybody still milking cows?  
**[0:58:02-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:58:02):**  My dad's got like, I think one or two cows that he leaves the calves on and he milks  them for kind of just himself.  But no, there's no, there's no commercial dairy there anymore.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:58:16):**  Moving literally halfway across the country in the middle of COVID, that's kind of brave,  like closing down a business to move halfway across the country.  That's what, what I'm curious to understand that.  
**[0:58:34-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:58:34):**  Well, so I had been from 2016 to 2019, I had been running grass fed dairy with a cheese  facility and we, so we bottled milk, we sold raw milk on the farm, we bottled pasteurized  and bottled milk, cream and butter, and we made seven different kinds of cheese and we  
**[0:59:03-0:59:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:59:03):**  marketed it all on the farm and then also direct through a farmer owned company that  I was part owner in that had its own trucks and distribution networks in Lincoln and Omaha.  And I ran that, we ran that for three years on mostly leased property.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:59:18):**  We didn't own the ground where the parlor and the plant was.  And we kind of just got to the point where we had to make a decision.  Do we want to expand and hire another person or two and really make this go or do we want  
**[0:59:33-0:59:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:59:33):**  to scale back?  Because it was getting to be too much for me and my wife to handle.  And we had a two year old daughter and we just decided, you know, our daughter's only  
**[0:59:43-0:59:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:59:43):**  going to be two, three and four years old for the next three years.  And we don't want to be doing that right now.  And because we were in a lease situation, we were able to stop.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=0:59:54):**  We were able to just stop the lease and walk away.  We sold most of our heifers and most of our milking cows out here to New York.  I had some customers out here that had been using bulls and had gotten some cattle in  
**[1:00:06-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:00:06):**  the past, sold them all there and kept the heifers and the dry cows and stuff.  And that was when I went to work for OCM.  I worked for OCM with my good buddy, Mike Calacrate.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:00:21):**  He was on the board there.  And I worked for OCM for about from January of 2020 until October of 2020, which was the  month before I came here.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:00:33):**  But I had applied for this job here.  I'd heard about this place.  Basically before I got the job at OCM, I'd applied for a couple different, I'd applied  
**[1:00:44-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:00:44):**  for some different jobs that I was interested in a couple of different places.  And this place was one of them.  And they had just hired somebody and so they said, we're not hiring now.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:00:55):**  And one day I got a call out of the blue from a main phone number and answered it.  And it was my supervisor here now, Joe Grady.  And he said, our manager didn't work out.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:01:09):**  Would you be interested in coming and taking a look?  And so talked to my wife and she said, yeah, let's check it out.  I'm ready for an adventure.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:01:20):**  And so we just, I just really liked it here.  I like the people here.  I like the attitude of kind of lifelong learning and research and a focus on teaching.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:01:34):**  That's important to me with the background that I have.  I love teaching.  I love being in the classroom.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:01:41):**  And I love that connection and that relationship that you can build with students and see real  results and real progress that you just kind of turn out into the world and see what happens.  I just kind of like that kind of thing.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:01:58):**  And so, you know, we just decided to give it a shot.  And like I said, I moved out here first and she came later.  But we're loving it here.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:02:13):**  It sounds totally unfeasible and unreasonable and crazy, but I don't know, it just something  clicked and seemed to fit and we kind of like it.  I had to read your email twice to make sure it said Sandhills in Nebraska to me.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:02:29):**  Okay, I'm a Kansas boy.  I live on the south end of the state.  And for my whole life, I've heard about the Sandhills in Nebraska.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:02:41):**  Okay, Sandhills, great, you know, big hills full of sand, never didn't really think much  of it.  And you know, everybody loves the Sandhills.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:02:50):**  Everybody loves the Sandhills.  Well, about a year ago, I was traveling up to Rapid City.  I thought, well, I got to go from southern Kansas to Rapid City, South Dakota, I might  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:02:58):**  as well go see what the Sandhills are all about.  I get it.  I mean, I get it.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:03:04):**  I love my red hills.  The Sandhills are pretty.  I mean, they really are.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:03:09):**  The winters might suck, though.  We've kind of talked a little bit about the weather.  But what I'm interested in now, and you know, this is kind of the thread we're on and I want  
**[1:03:17-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:03:17):**  to pull it a little bit, is what are some of the differences in the culture of agriculture  that you've noticed going from Nebraska to Maine?  And like, I kind of want to preface this with, it was a conversation we had shared a meal  
**[1:03:35-1:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:03:35):**  with some friends the other day, and the question was asked, what's the difference between a  farmer and a rancher?  And I think that really, really depends on which side of the Mississippi you're standing  
**[1:03:46-1:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:03:46):**  on or which coast you're standing on.  Because like, in the East Coast, my friend Michael Kinsey down in Georgia, there's no  ranches, everything's a farm, you have a cow farm.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:00):**  Like you are a farmer, if you have cows, if you grow crops, you are a farmer.  You go to California, and everything's a ranch.  Nobody's a farmer in California.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:09):**  Everybody's got a ranch.  You know, like Christopher Ranch.  I'm like, oh, cool.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:14):**  That's neat.  What kind of cows they have?  Strawberries.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:17):**  Oh, okay.  So everything's a ranch in California.  Everything's a farm on the East Coast.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:21):**  What do you think about that?  I can see that.  And yeah, you're definitely right.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:28):**  The nomenclature is different.  I mean, I don't know if I've seen any signs along the road that say ranch, they all say  farm out here.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:38):**  But for me, boy, I don't know how I would draw that line or delineate that.  I've always considered myself to be a rancher.  And honestly, and I've told, I think I told Clay this in the working cows.  
**[1:04:52-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:04:52):**  I've learned more about how to more effectively manage a grass fed dairy from the ranching  from the cattle ranching side of things and thinking about some of the profitability markers  you might call them or the targets that you want to hit, especially when it comes to breeding  
**[1:05:14-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:05:14):**  and fertility and age of first calving and things like that.  And especially when it comes to raising your heifers and the cost of raising heifers.  I've gained more from the ranching side of things and from like reading Burke-Ticard  
**[1:05:33-1:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:05:33):**  articles and stuff like that that have helped me more than reading like articles in Hoards  Dairymen or Progressive Dairymen.  Nothing against the conventional dairy world.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:05:46):**  Those guys do what they do and they do it very efficiently.  But when it comes to grass-based dairy or grass-only dairy, there's just not a lot of  help there.  
**[1:05:57-1:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:05:57):**  And like just the way you think about your operation and the cows and your product and  your, you know, it's just totally different.  And  
**[1:06:08-1:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:06:08):**  Does some of that come from your father when he said run your dairy like you run a ranch?  Yeah, yeah.  And so like when we started that raw milk business, he called it Gotchle Ranch, you  
**[1:06:22-1:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:06:22):**  know, he called it Clover Cove was the business name of that.  He called it Clover Cove Ranch Dairy.  And so that was a great conversation starter because people were like, what's a ranch dairy?  
**[1:06:33-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:06:33):**  And it's like, well, in simple terms, it's a dairy that's on a ranch and we manage our  cattle just like beef cattle when we milk them.  And then people are like, oh, okay, well, I didn't know you could do that.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:06:45):**  And then it starts in conversation, which leads to, you know, some differences in the  actual product, which was what we were selling.  You know, we began selling, we started selling food instead of a commodity.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:06:57):**  And so, you know, one of the things that, you know, that I tell people about, you know,  how do you run your dairy like a ranch is sell meat, sell milk, you know, sell food  for people don't sell a commodity.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:07:12):**  And so to me that that might be maybe one of the differences.  Although, you know, there's commodity ranchers to, you know, beef is a commodity, cattle  are a commodity somewhat.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:07:23):**  So you know, I don't, I don't know, I don't know.  To me, it's kind of more of a mindset than like, something that you can like see from  the road as you drive by.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:07:33):**  Right.  And that makes sense.  But the culture here, there's a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of, because we have a  
**[1:07:44-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:07:44):**  lot of campers here, we have a little more influx of people from like Boston in New York.  There's a lot more big city folks that are watching what we do.  And there's, there's a, there's just a lot of curiosity, a lot of questioning.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:08:03):**  There's a little bit of the kind of the pet owner mentality that just can't wrap their  head around the fact that your cows sleep outside.  And just can't, can't fathom, you know, a cow giving birth, like that's just, but they  
**[1:08:20-1:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:08:20):**  get to see it here.  So they're exposed to it.  And like, and obviously I was living in farming ranching communities in Nebraska, but I even  
**[1:08:34-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:08:34):**  even when I was living in like Lincoln, which isn't a huge city, but it's a city.  There just wasn't that much separation.  Somebody, anybody you talk to on the street probably had a cousin or uncle or their grandpa  
**[1:08:48-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:08:48):**  that had a farm.  And so like, they appreciated farming and agriculture and ranching, but they weren't  like fascinated by it or really connected to it.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:08:59):**  Right.  But people here are probably less connected to agriculture other than through the food  they eat, but more fascinated by it, more curious about it and, and much more aware  
**[1:09:12-1:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:09:12):**  of its environmental impacts.  Like, you know, I would say that, that, that our customers out here or our visitors out  here are way more savvy about like soil carbon and, and, uh, water quality than, than a lot  
**[1:09:29-1:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:09:29):**  of the people, your average folks that I would, you know, talk to back, back in Nebraska.  I mean, they're, they're really, they they're informed about that kind of thing.  And they, they know that it's connected to agriculture somehow.  
**[1:09:43-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:09:43):**  And they, they just are really, they really want to learn.  It's, I've been amazed by how cure naturally curious the, the quote unquote, you know,  the city folks are, and they just really just love to talk about it and they love to listen.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:00):**  I get that.  I mean, I totally get what you're saying.  I'm kind of curious if there's a little bit of confirmation bias in there because of who's  
**[1:10:11-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:11):**  coming to the farm or if that's a general overall cultural, uh, heightened cultural  awareness of things like soil carbon and water quality.  And sure.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:22):**  Definitely.  I mean, if you're going to go camping at a place called Wolf's neck center for agriculture  and the environment, you're probably going to be a certain type of person, or at least,  
**[1:10:31-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:31):**  you know, you're not scared off by those, by that phrase, you know?  So, um, you know, so yeah, there's definitely, you're absolutely right.  You know, um, while we get folks from all, you know, we get all types of folks here,  
**[1:10:46-1:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:46):**  visitors and campers.  Yes.  They are the type of folks that will, that, uh, you know, that think it's cool to camp  
**[1:10:51-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:10:51):**  on a farm, you know, versus, you know, in the back country somewhere a hundred miles  from the nearest town.  It, you know, I think that's one of those, those enterprises or concessions that almost  
**[1:11:04-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:11:04):**  anybody could figure out how to do.  Like there's, there's several websites.  Are you listed on any, uh, for like there's harvest toast, there's hip camp.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:11:17):**  There's remember, yes, they use, they use a software system here in the campground and  I'm not my interface with the campground is supplying the farm cafe with meat and supplying  the farm store with, with me.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:11:33):**  So like they have a farm store and it's kind of like a big top tent and then a farm cafe.  It's like a little order window with outside seating, but like, yes, they do.  They do some of that software, but, but yeah, I mean, I'll find it.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:11:47):**  I'll put it in the show notes.  I'll figure it out.  Yeah.  
**[1:11:50-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:11:50):**  It's, it's kind of blown my mind how they've turned basically marginal, marginal ground  that has a nice view, but it's marginal ground on this property, on this farm into real generation,  real income and revenue generation.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:12:06):**  I mean, those campgrounds are full from Memorial day to labor day.  And it kind of slowly trickles out from there, but there's still people camping here now.  I mean, so they, they, they bring people in and they stay and they, they stay, they don't  
**[1:12:25-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:12:25):**  just stay for a weekend.  Some of them camp here for a couple of weeks.  Wow.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:12:30):**  Well, I, I imagine if I had to live through New York or Boston and COVID, I would try  to buy an RV and escape too.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:12:39):**  COVID was really good for the camping part of things here.  It, it people, well, everywhere people got more interested in outdoor activities.  And so, yeah, we, we've seen a huge influx of visitors.  
**[1:12:55-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:12:55):**  I think, I think in 2020, they had somewhere North of 33,000 visitors in the season.  And this year I think they almost doubled that.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:06):**  Yeah.  So when I say there's visitors here, I mean, there's visitors here.  Like there are people everywhere.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:14):**  It's like farming in a fish bowl.  My introvert self just noped out of that.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:20):**  Yeah.  It's definitely something to get used to, but it's also kind of cool.  It's also really interesting because you meet a lot of people and it's not necessarily like  
**[1:13:30-1:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:30):**  my responsibility to be the agricultural ambassador or like the tour guide, but you know, you  see these people, you talk to them, they ask you questions and it's really cool.  Well, it's, it's, it's neat.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:42):**  And you know, some days you're having a bad day.  You're frustrated, you're in a hurry or whatever.  You're just like, God, I hope I don't see anybody.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:48):**  I hope I don't have to stop and talk to anybody.  But you know, most days it's, it's, it's kind of neat.  Right on.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:13:58):**  Right on.  It is not like ranching in the sandhills.  We have 33,000 people in the town.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:07):**  That's like a hundred a day.  Yeah.  That's like 80 or 90 a day.  
**[1:14:14-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:14):**  So it's open to the public year round and they have several miles of hiking trails.  And so a lot of people that are nearby come and hike here and they have, because of the  water, they have kayaking and canoeing and, and then they have, you know, the, the campgrounds.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:31):**  I don't know exactly how many campgrounds there are, but I want to say there's close  to 300.  Wow.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:39):**  Okay.  So when those are full and then they're flipping every three days, you know, you're talking  900 visitors a week.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:49):**  Wow.  Just in camp, just in camping.  Wow.  
**[1:14:55-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:14:55):**  Well, I mean, if, if you can do it and you want to do it, yeah, there's no reason to  not take advantage of it because I mean, the people are out there, they're going up and  down the road to toy haulers and RVs every day.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:09):**  And there's tons of them.  There's way more than there were two years ago.  I can tell, even out here in the middle of nowhere.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:15):**  Yeah.  So you mentioned earlier.  Okay.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:18):**  Now we know that we've got, we've got a river running through the place and the wolf snicks,  Holsteins are on one side and your jerseys are on the other.  So do you have two milking setups?  
**[1:15:31-1:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:31):**  No, I, I, I left the cow.  I decided to leave the calves on my cows and not milk them.  Okay.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:39):**  So they, I, this, that was new for me, actually.  I usually would have a nurse cow herd and then a milk milking herd and milk, however  many cows and run the calves and raise the calves on the nurse cows.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:15:52):**  But this year I left all the calves on their own mothers.  I imagine somebody that's smarter than me with dairy would have picked that up and not  asked that dumb question.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:16:03):**  So the next dumb question I'm going to ask is, so when you like, are you going to be  milking both herds at the same time?  And how are you going to keep the milk separate?  
**[1:16:13-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:16:13):**  The only, the only way we would milk both herds would probably be to start some kind  of micro dairy enterprise with my herd that did like small, super small scale micro dairy,  raw milk or butter cheese or something like that.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:16:31):**  Although, although, as I kind of build up my herd numbers and I have extra females,  I will likely, you know, not probably not this coming season, but maybe next year, 2023,  we'll probably start adding reproduction females to the wolf's neck herd.  
**[1:16:52-1:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:16:52):**  And I, if things go the way we hope they go by then that milking herd will look a lot  more like my milking herd did back in Nebraska, you know, where I was running, you know, doing  a hundred percent grass fed, not on a contract, but on a commercial level.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:17:10):**  Because that's their goal at wolf, wolf's, tongue tied, wolf's neck, right?  Is they want to go from where they're at to, to a year round grass dairy, right?  Well, they definitely, they, yeah, that that's appealing to them.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:17:25):**  And so right now, I mean, we produce milk under contract to Stonyfield.  Our milk goes into Stonyfield yogurt.  Stonyfield actually, back when it was owned by Danone helped build this place in terms  
**[1:17:40-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:17:40):**  of the dairy.  And it basically, you know, they were a partner in, they're a partner in open team and they're  a partner at wolf's neck with, with our farmer training program.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:17:54):**  And so we produce milk under contract for Stonyfield.  We're allowed by that contract to use a certain percentage of our production for outside sales  where that's whatever we want to do with it.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:18:06):**  We can't make yogurt.  There's a non-compete in there.  But but we can do other things with it.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:18:13):**  And so I think the goal is to explore more of that value added stuff, especially because  we have such a significant farm retail outlet here.  And and yeah, that's that's another reason why why I'm here is because of my experience  
**[1:18:29-1:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:18:29):**  with the value added processing and making the different products like butter and cheese.  And just the what it takes to run a raw milk dairy that you know that is safe.  That you know that that you feel good about putting out to the public.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:18:48):**  Not that I'm scared of raw milk, but you have to you have to do it well.  You have to and and that's a skill that I think young people and people that are coming  into the dairy industry really want to know about.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:18:58):**  It's most of the yeah, most of the applicants that I see that are interested in coming here.  And a lot of the applicants in the DGA are interested in a food producing dairy.  Like they they don't they don't all see much of a future in contract milk production.  
**[1:19:21-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:19:21):**  They don't see themselves fitting into that.  They don't see an opportunity for that.  They may come out of the DGA and manage one of those places and they may transition.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:19:31):**  You know, there may be a transition to that.  But I would say very few people under 30 are going to go build buy land and build a dairy  and get a contract.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:19:43):**  It's just not happening.  Organic companies are cutting contracts right now.  And and that's like that that's almost counterintuitive, isn't it?  
**[1:19:55-1:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:19:55):**  That the organic companies are cutting the contracts like it up there in the northeast.  There is a there is a big co-op that let a whole bunch of producers go right.  What so where they get their product?  
**[1:20:08-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:08):**  From where you're at down by down Texas in the Midwest.  They and they and they're also opening some dairies closer to their plant processing plant  in Buffalo.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:18):**  So basically they said it's too much.  It costs us too much.  It's too much trouble to drive around all these little 30 and 40, 50 cow dairies in  
**[1:20:25-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:25):**  New England.  We'll just haul it in by the tanker load where we can buy it cheaper in the Midwest or close  to our plant in New York where we don't have to haul this far.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:36):**  It's disappointing.  I mean, I imagine very little bit that live in Texas or you know, around that big mega  dairy wherever it is that they're building it.  
**[1:20:45-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:45):**  I bet they're happy to have it in town because they don't understand what it means for the  people in New York in the northeast and that they're going to lose however many dozens  of 30 and 40 head small dairies.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:20:57):**  Well, that's just one of the problems when you get right away from regional, you know,  regional production is, you know, you're competing.  Basically these farmers in the New England are forced to compete with farmers in the  
**[1:21:14-1:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:21:14):**  West and the Midwest.  You know, they we have different considerations here.  You know, different costs of production and you know, I was just at the Stonyfield producer  
**[1:21:27-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:21:27):**  meeting yesterday and they were, there was a presentation on, on the cost of raising  dairy replacement heifers and the information he was putting up there was showed that it  costs, it costs the average Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania organic dairy, somewhere between  
**[1:21:46-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:21:46):**  $2,500 and $3,300 to raise a heifer to when she calves and perishes milk for the first  time.  And that's, that's a lot more than a beef cow.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:21:59):**  Yes.  And so I see actually that made some bells go off in my head and I started thinking,  wow, what a great opportunity for a young person to get into this industry who knows  
**[1:22:11-1:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:22:11):**  how to graze, who, who doesn't have money to buy or build a parlor, or doesn't have  the money to buy or, or buy land, but knows how to graze, could lease some ground, establish  a relationship with some of these, these farmers and either do some custom heifer growing that  
**[1:22:30-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:22:30):**  included breeding services or, or just buy, buy people's extra heifer calves.  I mean, if you can save $2,500 by selling your calves, I mean, that's the thing is like,  it's a hell of an idea.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:22:44):**  I mean, I could go buy a bunch of Jersey heifer calves, you know, ball and Jersey heifer calves,  put them on grass feed, feed them all the alfalfa they wanted and they wouldn't eat  me out of house and home.  
**[1:22:57-1:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:22:57):**  And yeah, that, that's a heck of an opportunity for a young person to take some of those heifers  and develop them on grass and sell them back to dairies.  Well, and I think, I think part of it is, is tied into the supply needs to come from  
**[1:23:11-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:23:11):**  those dairies.  Like you get those, you get the cattle from the dairy, from those dairies so that you're  not bringing new cattle into that system and driving the market down.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:23:22):**  You're adding about or you're, you're basically kind of inserting yourself as a part of the  value chain.  And that's one thing that dairy, um, at least small scale dairy, and maybe even organic  
**[1:23:32-1:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:23:32):**  dairy doesn't do as well as the beef industry does.  I mean, cause in beef, you got your, you got your cow calf guys, you got your stocker growers,  you got your guys that raise yearlings, you got, you know, your finishers, you don't got,  
**[1:23:43-1:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:23:43):**  you know, all these dairies are like kind of little micro and vertically integrated  operations.  Why not outsource some of that stuff?  
**[1:23:51-1:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:23:51):**  Why not, why not, uh, have maybe a few more specialists that can do these things, do them  well and do them more efficiently and then just have those, those guys kind of fit into  the business.  
**[1:24:06-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:06):**  It makes sense.  I mean, it definitely makes sense and kind of related to that.  Uh, I think that some of those beef guys have some things to learn from these grass fed  
**[1:24:17-1:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:17):**  dairy guys.  Cause I mean, if you want to learn how to finish, I mean, you want to talk about a lack  of finishing skill in beef, you know, people always say, oh, there's not enough finishers,  
**[1:24:28-1:24:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:28):**  not enough grass finishers.  Well, you want to finish cow, a beef cow on grass.  Look at how these guys graze dairy cattle.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:37):**  Look at the forage that they're putting those cows on and how they're managing it.  You can finish beef that way.  Yep.  
**[1:24:44-1:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:44):**  You don't have, and you don't have to get them in and milk them.  So I actually see, and this is a shameless plug for the DGA and for what we're doing  here, I see a lot of value.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:24:54):**  If there's some young beef kids on a beef ranch out in the West and the Midwest, they're  like trying to think of a way to, to, to become part of the family operation.  Why not learn some things from the dairy industry?  
**[1:25:08-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:25:08):**  You might go back and be the guy that does the grass finishing on your family's ranch.  You might be the kid that comes back and, and adds an enterprise like backgrounding  dairy heifers to your family's ranch.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:25:22):**  Why not, why not, why not do an apprenticeship and learn that?  You know, nobody likes to milk cows, right?  Nobody likes to clean sour milk tanks, but no, I get it.  
**[1:25:35-1:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:25:35):**  It makes perfect sense.  Because if you can keep a cow in a, on a high enough plane of nutrition to be making, you  know, as much milk as she's going to make.  
**[1:25:45-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:25:45):**  And you know, with the, with the butterfat components and the protein components where  you need it, if you know how to feed that cow that way, chances are, you could probably  make a steer look pretty fat on that same feed and you're hit the nail on the head.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:25:59):**  I mean, it's a skill that not very many people have.  You know, I don't really know what I'm doing grass finishing an animal.  I know when they look the best, that's about it.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:26:11):**  So well, and when you're, if you're raising the calves on the cows, so let's say you've  got, you've got some Jersey mama cows and jerseys make great mother cows.  And you've got, they've got two calves on and they're weaning.  
**[1:26:27-1:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:26:27):**  Like I, when I was, I was shooting for those Jersey cows, they're, you know, they're weighing  between eight and 900 pounds of cows and they were weaning two 450 pound calves.  So they were weighing some of those little Jersey cows were weaning 110% of their body  
**[1:26:49-1:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:26:49):**  weight.  Now, that's a good ratio.  If you can lease pasture, like on a, maybe you can do it on a per head per day or whatever,  
**[1:26:59-1:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:26:59):**  you know, maybe it costs you, let's say it costs you a buck 50 per head per pair.  I mean, and a pair is actually three.  So what's your, what's your cost?  
**[1:27:11-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:27:11):**  What's your cost of gain?  What's your value of gain on those calves?  I mean, that is some efficiency right there where, you know, you've got this little cow  
**[1:27:20-1:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:27:20):**  that's basically a butterfat factory and she is putting pounds on calves and she's not  taken up a lot of space and not eating a lot.  Can we talk about butterfat a little bit?  
**[1:27:35-1:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:27:35):**  Like, okay, so I might not be understanding the full context with which you use that word  butterfat.  So in my mind, what I hear when I hear somebody say butterfat, I'm thinking of a grass carcass,  
**[1:27:53-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:27:53):**  a grass based finished carcass.  And the butterfat is going to be the yellower stuff.  Through reading Johann Zitzmann and Steve Campbell, like there's some visual indicators  
**[1:28:07-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:28:07):**  that you can see on an animal that will tell you if she's likely to be able to produce  more butterfat or lay down like thicker butterfat deposits.  Is that, is any of what I said true or is it all bullcrap?  
**[1:28:25-1:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:28:25):**  It's actually very true, especially in regards to the jerseys.  And so in dairy, butterfat is basically just the fat content in the milk.  They call it butterfat because it's just what they've always called it because butter was  
**[1:28:42-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:28:42):**  the product, you know, so they want it, you want to have butterfat and actually, you know,  on the Jersey islands, that's what they, that's how they develop the breed.  That's how they develop the breed.  
**[1:28:53-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:28:53):**  They actually just, they didn't measure how many pounds of milk they gave.  They actually measured how many pounds of butter the cows produced.  And so the higher percent, you know, the higher, obviously you want a high butterfat percent,  
**[1:29:09-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:29:09):**  you know, coupled with, you know, you kind of have that balancing act between volume  and percent to produce total pounds.  That basically you know, a Jersey cow can produce between, you know, you're kind of  
**[1:29:24-1:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:29:24):**  your more commercial conventional ones are 4%.  But I mean, I've had cows that were upwards of 7% and even a couple that were up in the  8% butterfat.  
**[1:29:34-1:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:29:34):**  So twice as much butterfat and at terms of percent, maybe not in terms of volume as like  a, as like a, your regular milk cow.  But butterfat is directly correlated to certain meat qualities.  
**[1:29:49-1:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:29:49):**  And they've done this research, the Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Nebraska back  in 1976, did a research study and they used jerseys in it.  And they, they found that the jerseys had the best, significantly higher ribeye fat  
**[1:30:09-1:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:30:09):**  percentage and the best tenderness by far, all breeds, and that was up against Angus,  Hereford, Charley, Limousine, Simmental, everything.  And the problem with the jerseys in that commercial, in that study, and why they're not commercially  
**[1:30:25-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:30:25):**  viable for beef production is they, you know, they, they had the lightest or they had the  lowest average daily gain, and they had the lowest weaning weights and you know, all this  stuff.  
**[1:30:37-1:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:30:37):**  They had the shortest gestation length, the lightest birth weight, fewer deaths, the lightest  weaning or the, the, the highest relative growth rate.  So daily gain.  
**[1:30:49-1:31:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:30:49):**  So they're better in every way that makes the cattlemen money and worse in every way  that makes the packer money.  Basically, yes, exactly.  
**[1:31:02-1:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:31:02):**  And that was from random selection of commercial jersey breeds from commercial jerseys from,  from the dominant AI studs at the time.  Imagine just think about that and imagine if you were using jerseys that were selectively  
**[1:31:18-1:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:31:18):**  bred for the butter fat trades and the, and the, and the, and the fleshing ability and  the ability to put down fat and the, and those things that, that, you know, it just makes  you wonder.  
**[1:31:33-1:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:31:33):**  Because, you know, I, about all I eat is Jersey beef and I, until I find something better,  I'm not going to switch.  And that's, that's what brought customers back to us time and time again.  
**[1:31:46-1:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:31:46):**  And that Jersey beef is, is delicious.  And it's, and it's, you know, I, about the best cross that we found was a Jersey, was  a Jersey, was a low line red Angus crossed on a Jersey.  
**[1:32:03-1:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:32:03):**  I mean, you could finish those on grass in 18 to 20 months and the meat quality was superior.  They weren't big.  You were never going to have one that weighed 1200 pounds even, but man, they were good.  
**[1:32:18-1:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:32:18):**  Okay.  Before we get away from, from this butterfat thread, what are some visual indicators when  somebody's looking at a cow?  
**[1:32:31-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:32:31):**  What are some visual indicators that indicate she's, she's laying down more butterfat and  going to have richer milk?  Well, there's kind of the old peasant wisdom of, you know, Gerald Fry was always promoting  
**[1:32:44-1:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:32:44):**  this too, going around.  But if you look in, if you look in their ears, they'll have yellow, dark, almost dark orange,  yellow, flaky skin inside their ears.  
**[1:32:59-1:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:32:59):**  That's that's one of them.  You know, and just happy, you know, they dairy cows have happy lines too.  Like you look at those, you look at the you look at the, like in the face, right in between  
**[1:33:12-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:12):**  the eyes.  Well, you look at the picture of a bull or a cow from the side and you see those horizontal  lateral lines across the rib cage, right.  
**[1:33:21-1:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:21):**  That are basically just loop, you know, that that's an indicator.  Vertical folds in the neck.  Yes.  
**[1:33:29-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:29):**  Yeah.  Pleating the brisket.  I don't know if you see, I haven't paid much attention to that.  
**[1:33:36-1:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:36):**  That's a different fertility thing.  Get my Zietzmann stuff messed up.  Hair on the udder.  
**[1:33:45-1:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:45):**  That's another one, isn't it?  Like lack of hair on the udder?  Yeah, smooth, smooth pink hairless udder or the hair is fine, very fine.  
**[1:33:54-1:34:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:33:54):**  Not that coarse, long hair.  But like if the hair is really fine and short, or sometimes in the summertime, even they'll  be completely hairless.  
**[1:34:08-1:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:34:08):**  Anything else come to mind on that or did I screw you up too bad and get them all?  Not really, but one of the wonderful things about modern technology is they've got this  thing called a scale.  
**[1:34:19-1:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:34:19):**  And when dairy farmers, we measure our output, and we know which cows are given the most  butter fat.  And we can select for that among our herd.  
**[1:34:31-1:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:34:31):**  And we don't have to solely rely on visual indicators.  We can actually drill down and pinpoint a lot of milk quality traits, either by genetically  testing them with hair, blood, or skin, or by testing the milk itself.  
**[1:34:52-1:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:34:52):**  So that's one of the neat things about dairy is that element of it.  There is a significant amount of testing that can be done to determine some of those things.  That's a good segue into talking about lactose.  
**[1:35:12-1:35:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:35:12):**  So controversial opinion that I have is like there's always a certain number, a certain  percentage of people that are lactose intolerant.  Okay, I get that.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:35:28):**  Used to be on the rise lately, way above like the historical baseline.  So is it psychosomatic?  Is it some other factor or did we screw up the lactose in milk?  
**[1:35:45-1:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:35:45):**  I mean, I understand there's different kinds of lactose.  There's A1 and A2 lactose, but have we all actually A2 and A2 are proteins.  They're casein proteins.  
**[1:35:58-1:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:35:58):**  They're a specific protein called beta casein.  I'm obviously wrong, so please educate me.  There's several different proteins in milk and they're different caseins.  
**[1:36:16-1:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:36:16):**  So the beta casein, what you're talking about is A1, A2, that's beta casein.  I want to say somewhere on like the, there's a histamine producing proline that's on the  67th something or other in the gene that produces the different types.  
**[1:36:42-1:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:36:42):**  So you can have different variants that are controlled by the genetics of the cow.  But in simple terms, the A2 variant is the oldest and the A1 variant is the newest in  terms of like all of history.  
**[1:37:02-1:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:37:02):**  The A1 variant is the one.  So the A2 is what is the protein that would have been in the milk a thousand years ago  and the A1 is a relatively kind of new thing.  
**[1:37:13-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:37:13):**  Okay, I get it.  Incidentally, the A1 protein is correlated.  It's not causation, but it's correlated with higher milk volume.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:37:22):**  So think about that in terms of what we've selected dairy cattle for in the last 60 years.  Going back to the protein.  So there's been research done that purports to indicate that the A2 protein is more digestible,  
**[1:37:39-1:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:37:39):**  has less of a diabetic type effect.  I've done this research in mostly New Zealand and Australia.  Basically if people have a protein allergy to milk, it's likely they have a protein allergy  
**[1:38:01-1:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:38:01):**  to the A1 variant of the beta casein protein.  If that makes any sense.  And that's what people are calling lactose intolerance.  
**[1:38:12-1:38:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:38:12):**  So there is, yes, there is.  And all I have is anecdotal evidence from 12 years of selling raw milk direct to customers.  But there were definitely people who could drink our milk that was A2, A2 and raw that  
**[1:38:35-1:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:38:35):**  could not drink pasteurized milk or even pasteurized A2 milk.  And they were always told that they were lactose intolerant and to avoid milk and all milk.  But raw milk has lactase in it.  
**[1:38:56-1:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:38:56):**  That's what you don't have that helps you digest lactose.  You don't have the lactase enzyme that digests it.  But raw milk has lactase in it because it hasn't been killed through pasteurization.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:39:11):**  So, you know, I'm not going to say that raw A2, A2 milk is like this wonderful superfood  that can cure everything.  But some people who can't drink other kinds of milk can drink it and not have the problems  
**[1:39:32-1:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:39:32):**  that they have when they drink other types of milk.  My anecdotal evidence would tend to agree with yours, sir.  And there's a huge demand for A2 milk.  
**[1:39:45-1:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:39:45):**  And you know, the people that I hear from that are wanting A2 cows, because you can  test your cattle genetically and find out if they are homozygous for the A2 variant  of the beta casein protein.  
**[1:39:58-1:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:39:58):**  And you can selectively breed your cattle to all produce that particular protein.  So, that's one of the things that I do.  It sounds like I kind of did have most of it correct.  
**[1:40:10-1:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:10):**  I just had some of the terminology wrong.  We did screw it up.  We did screw it up.  
**[1:40:15-1:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:15):**  Yeah, lactose is a sugar.  So it needs that lactase to help your body digest it.  But the A2, so yeah, a lot of people confuse, oh, this is A2 milk.  
**[1:40:27-1:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:27):**  I won't be intolerant to it.  I'm lactose intolerant.  No.  
**[1:40:31-1:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:31):**  If it's raw, maybe, but like pasteurized A2 milk would still have the same effect on a  lactose intolerant person.  What about raw A1 milk?  
**[1:40:45-1:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:45):**  I have no idea.  It probably would be fine for someone with that was lactose intolerant, but not someone  that was allergic to the A1 protein.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:40:56):**  I wonder if there's anybody that's doing a raw dairy with those big, massive bony Holstein  cows.  If there is somebody out there listening, give me a call.  
**[1:41:11-1:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:41:11):**  Maybe we'll do an episode.  We've been going for almost an hour and 45.  Kind of need to start wrapping this up.  
**[1:41:21-1:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:41:21):**  Have we left anything on the table?  I don't know.  I like to talk about all kinds of stuff.  
**[1:41:30-1:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:41:30):**  I'm always willing to jump in and discuss things.  But no, I think it's been an interesting year for everyone, everywhere, this 2020 and 2021,  to see what kind of things have happened.  
**[1:41:49-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:41:49):**  I'm just happy to be still involved in agriculture, still involved in the dairy industry.  Your podcast and other podcasts have helped me stay connected at a time when there weren't  conferences, there weren't meetings, there weren't things that you could do and see people.  
**[1:42:09-1:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:42:09):**  I'm grateful for those types of outlets and educational opportunities to hear from people  that you'd love to be sitting across the table from but you just couldn't be.  So I'm looking forward to more of that.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:42:22):**  Like I said earlier, if there's any folks out there that are interested in grazing dairy,  one of the things I'm trying to do here is figure out what kind of person we need to  produce and how we need to train people to be the people that will carry this industry  
**[1:42:39-1:42:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:42:39):**  into the future.  Because a lot of people will say, well, there's no future in dairy, there's no hope, you got  to milk a thousand cows or you just might as well stop, not even try.  
**[1:42:50-1:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:42:50):**  And I just don't think that's true.  I think there will always be a place for a well-managed, well-conceived of dairy business  that doesn't have to be at a large scale.  
**[1:43:06-1:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:43:06):**  I think it's all about the people who are doing it and their attitude and their ability  to figure out what they can do using their skills and knowledge in a place where they  can put those things to use.  
**[1:43:21-1:43:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:43:21):**  And that's what we're trying to do here is identify those people, bring them here, get  them the training and the experience that they need and the opportunity to learn and  the opportunity to fail and the opportunity to decide what they don't want to do just  
**[1:43:40-1:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:43:40):**  as much as decide what they do want to do.  We accept the apprentices' applications on a rolling basis.  We might be full now, but we're not going to be full forever.  
**[1:43:55-1:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:43:55):**  And I'll make sure that I have a link to the Dairy Grazers Apprenticeship Program website.  I almost said Dairy Grazers Association.  I'll make sure I have that link in the show notes.  
**[1:44:07-1:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:07):**  And if anybody listening to this didn't catch it on the first go round, you can get, we  did full episode with Joe Tomondo on the Dairy Grazer Apprenticeship Program.  That was number 21.  
**[1:44:19-1:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:19):**  Check your favorite podcast, player or app or provider for that.  Oh, that was a good one.  So Ben, I appreciate you joining me on short notice, like I said at the beginning.  
**[1:44:32-1:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:32):**  And it's been an awful lot of fun.  Where can we find you on social media?  How can folks get ahold of you?  
**[1:44:39-1:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:39):**  Anything you want to plug?  The floor is yours.  You can even ask me a bunch of questions.  
**[1:44:43-1:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:43):**  Like, I mean, we don't have to quit now.  We can go for a little bit.  My website is Holt Creek Jerseys dot com.  
**[1:44:53-1:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:44:53):**  And then the website for the farm here is wolfsnec.org.  Wolf with an E. So W-O-L-F-E-S-N-E-C-K dot org.  And then I'm on Facebook and Instagram with Holt Creek Jerseys.  
**[1:45:10-1:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:45:10):**  And so if you want to see pictures of cows and stuff and all that that's on there.  I always want to see pictures of cows.  But I have a question for you, Brian.  
**[1:45:25-1:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:45:25):**  One of your episodes, you said something about Corianese.  I know you do the Corianese deal there.  You said something.  
**[1:45:34-1:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:45:34):**  I don't know if it was you or one of your guests.  Or maybe it was even on a different podcast.  Somebody said Corianese or the Mexican Jersey.  
**[1:45:42-1:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:45:42):**  What was meant by that?  Was that you?  No, I didn't say that.  
**[1:45:47-1:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:45:47):**  But it sounds exactly like something I might say.  Maybe it was a guest on your podcast.  Somebody that was buying Corianese cattle and I thought that was maybe you.  
**[1:46:01-1:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:01):**  Because I know you were doing that weren't you?  Or maybe you still do.  Oh, I haven't bought any in a while.  
**[1:46:07-1:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:07):**  So for those that are catching the audio version, we don't have video version yet.  But you see that all the cows behind me are Corianese.  Some are full blood.  
**[1:46:16-1:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:16):**  Some are longhorns.  Like this one.  I was in the right place already.  
**[1:46:20-1:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:20):**  This one right over here.  That's a longhorn.  I've got two of those.  
**[1:46:25-1:46:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:25):**  But probably about 15 that are half bloods.  That are half feral cattle company composite bull and half Corianese.  I like them because they have something that no other breed has.  
**[1:46:44-1:46:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:44):**  The original Creole cattle were brought over in the early 1500s.  Turned loose in Mexico.  I mean very similar to the Piney Woods cattle and the Cracker cattle down in Florida.  
**[1:46:56-1:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:46:56):**  But these cattle basically ran wild in Mexico, northern Mexico and in the desert southwest  for 400 years.  They have 400 years of natural selection in an arid environment on hard grasses.  
**[1:47:11-1:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:47:11):**  Okay, so I understand that.  And then, I've been through ranching for profit.  Got to change myself on that one.  
**[1:47:26-1:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:47:26):**  On the last day of ranching for profit, they do a really powerful exercise.  They say, okay, what's your neighbor's ranch look like today?  And then you go through, you put numbers up there.  
**[1:47:36-1:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:47:36):**  Then they say, okay, what would happen if you took all the fences out and you came back  in 50 years?  What would it look like?  
**[1:47:43-1:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:47:43):**  And you run through that exercise.  Like the cow size come down, fertility rate drops, you know, the population distributes  more back to 50-50.  
**[1:47:52-1:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:47:52):**  And then they say, okay, make one change to your neighbor's cow herd that's been run wild  for 50 years to make it profitable.  And the only change you really need to make is you need to do a little bit better breeding  
**[1:48:04-1:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:04):**  and that's it.  Like you just need to change the bull ratio and then economic situation magically improves.  So I looked at that and go, oh, an 800 pound cow, 80% fertility on native range.  
**[1:48:19-1:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:19):**  That's what I need to be looking for.  That's where I think I found it.  And it's going to take me some time.  
**[1:48:25-1:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:25):**  It's going to take a few generations to get the ones that I want.  Just like it took you a while to get the jerseys you wanted or the cows you wanted when you  pulled all the inputs out from under him.  
**[1:48:36-1:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:36):**  You know, I didn't start with anything good.  I had to start with crap I bought from sale barn and some really good ones I bought from  a buddy.  
**[1:48:44-1:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:44):**  But it's been rough.  I mean, I don't want to share numbers, but it hasn't been as good as I expected.  But I've got some really nice looking heifers on the ground.  
**[1:48:53-1:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:48:53):**  I got some really good looking coming twos that we're going to breed next year.  And there's some good looking cows out there.  I mean, there's some good looking cows that basically eat sticks, rocks and dirt and drink  
**[1:49:04-1:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:49:04):**  air, and weighed 900 pounds and you know, wean a 350, 400 pound calf.  It's not a lot to complain about.  So I'll get there.  
**[1:49:21-1:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:49:21):**  But the natural selection, the small frame size, the forage efficiency, that's what really  appeals to me about the Corrientes.  Yeah.  
**[1:49:29-1:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:49:29):**  I think that, well, just yeah, the smaller cows seem to me to just do so much better.  And that has come from, I've seen that come out not from selecting for size, like selecting  for several other things, and kind of having some parameters that have really nothing to  
**[1:49:55-1:50:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:49:55):**  do with the appearance of the cow at all, or the physical characteristics of the cow.  And then all of a sudden, you just start to see this phenotype start to emerge several  generations into it.  
**[1:50:09-1:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:50:09):**  And you're like, huh, I wouldn't have thought that was what was going to happen.  But you know, when you have those, basically economically driven selection factors, you  know, what's gonna allow me to keep these cows for a few more years, what's gonna enable  
**[1:50:29-1:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:50:29):**  me to pay my bills and make a living and continue to do this.  And then what comes out of that on the cow end of it, it's like, you couldn't have decided  what that was when you started.  
**[1:50:45-1:50:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:50:45):**  And I think that's really interesting.  You know, Macaulay Kincaid said it best, he says, can't control what price you what you  sell for.  
**[1:50:56-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:50:56):**  You can only control how much money you spend, you can't control how much money you make,  you only control how much money you spend in this business.  And I get that.  
**[1:51:07-1:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:51:07):**  I totally get that.  You know, I'm all about the I'm all about the low input stuff.  Well, Ben, it's been a fantastic evening.  
**[1:51:19-1:51:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:51:19):**  I need to get out of here, though.  All right, sounds good.  Thanks for thanks for the opportunity.  
**[1:51:24-1:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:51:24):**  And it was a good time.  Well, thanks for joining me.  And y'all have a good week.  
**[1:51:28-1:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41#t=1:51:28):**  Thanks, profession.

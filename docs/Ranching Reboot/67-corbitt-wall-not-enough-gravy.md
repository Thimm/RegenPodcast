I have a great guest lined up for you today.  Over the last few weeks we've heard from Don Shifflebean with the NCBA, Brett Kinsey from  
**[0:01:23-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:01:23):**  MarCalf, Alex from over in the United Kingdom, we got to hear about what some of their livestock  tracking was like, and Mike Calicrate who's always educational.  And I felt like I wasn't quite done getting some education.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:01:35):**  So some of y'all might know this week's guest from his more or less daily YouTube updates  on cattle market conditions called Feeder Flash.  Joining me on Zoom all the way from Canyon, Texas, Mr. Corbett Wall.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome to the show.  How are you today?  I'm good.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:01:48):**  How are you, Brian?  I'm doing great.  And, you know, I kind of want to start off.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:01:54):**  I really don't know a dang thing about you other than you do feeder flash.  Why don't you tell me where you're at and how you got there?  Well, I am here in Canyon, Texas in my home office.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:02:09):**  I am employed by DV auction full time.  I do some speaking events on the side, talking about issues with the cattle industry.  I do some auctioneering on the side because it's my passion.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:02:27):**  And DV allows me to do that.  But my number one affiliation is with DV and I complete all the tasks that I have to do  for them before anything else.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:02:40):**  And that includes the daily feeder flash.  Okay, well, so for those of us that aren't really familiar with feeder flash, what is  it?  
**[0:02:51-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:02:51):**  Feeder flash is a daily cattle market report.  And I am, which comes around pretty regular.  I do it late at night so that it's as fresh as it can possibly be when my listeners want  
**[0:03:11-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:03:11):**  it, which is typically during their morning constitutional.  I would have a lot of constipated fans if I didn't get that thing out by five or six  o'clock in the morning.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:03:26):**  And so I do.  But I typically do it about 10 o'clock at night, usually posted about midnight.  And it has all the latest fundamental things that are affecting the cattle market and cash  
**[0:03:42-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:03:42):**  markets kind of emphasized on feeder cattle auctions.  I'm a big, big, big proponent of auctions.  That is something that's very near and dear to me.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:03:57):**  And if I can do anything with the feeder flash, it is to promote selling cattle at auction.  And that goes right along with the DV auction who I'm employed by.  But you know, I don't mean to get political on there and touch on touchy subjects, but  
**[0:04:19-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:04:19):**  it has just gotten to the point where this cattle industry has gotten so political that  it veers me in that direction.  I was a USDA market reporter and market reporting supervisor for almost 20 years.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:04:37):**  And I always stressed to my trainees, which I had a jillion of them, that the way you  report a market is, of course, we reported direct markets and grain markets and hay markets  and all kinds of markets, but typically a cattle auction, how you report one of those  
**[0:04:57-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:04:57):**  is if you were leaving the sale after you set and reported on the market, and you ran  into a buddy of yours in the parking lot on the way out, and he said to them, hey, I didn't  make it to the sale, how'd it go?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:05:13):**  You tell them how it went.  You don't just say, well, compared to last week, feeders were mostly steady to $1 higher  trade active demand good.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:05:25):**  See you old buddy.  That's not the way you report a market.  You tell them what happened.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:05:31):**  Who was the ones that were making the market higher or why was the market lower?  What are the things that were affecting the market?  What's the moisture conditions?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:05:43):**  What was the quality or condition of the cattle?  Things like that.  And I was always frustrated because at USDA, we were never encouraged to do that.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:05:55):**  Just encouraged to do the bare minimum?  Yeah, just bare minimum.  That's basically what they wanted.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:06:03):**  And it ruffled their feathers all the time as I tried to report markets in the manner  that I thought that they needed to be reported.  It just has a tendency to set the minimum performance standard.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:06:16):**  And that's where people go.  Well, for most individuals that want to go above and beyond, it's easier to back them  down to bare minimum than it is to get the lazy ones to do more.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:06:30):**  So that's typically what they do.  Yeah, for sure.  I'm thinking of, and this is something I talked about a little bit in the last episode, but  
**[0:06:41-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:06:41):**  just recently I was at the Grass-fed Exchange Conference down in Fort Worth.  And I listened to a couple of guys that operate some meat plants on a panel.  And one of them, the discussion was about testing to pass or testing to find.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:06:58):**  And the regulation says you have to do so many E. coli tests per quarter.  And the gentleman that was speaking, he said that he went to a conference and he was listening  to other meat plant operators saying, oh, well, it's such a hassle that we have to do  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:07:13):**  these tests once a quarter to submit them to see E. coli.  We never find anything.  It's just a big hassle.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:07:19):**  And he said that he tests 10 to 15 times a day and they almost always find something,  but they find it in the plant and then they can do something else with that product before  it goes out to the consumer.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:07:33):**  And I guess what I'm trying to say here is that's the most recent example I can find  in my head of a government standard where they say, well, you only have to do it four  times a year and this is just what you're looking for.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:07:44):**  And if we're just testing for that absolute minimum standard and just looking in that  tiny little window, it's kind of like the difference between peering through a keyhole  and looking at an IMAX screen.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:07:56):**  Right, for sure, early in my career with the federal government, I worked for meat grading  for a time and acceptance work and they would draw random samples and things like that,  which I realize it's not cost effective to run samples on all of it, but whenever you  
**[0:08:19-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:08:19):**  do find something that needs attention, it makes you wonder about how much else is in  there.  But I don't know in their capacity what the answer for that would be.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:08:33):**  I think that my takeaway from that is, and this is kind of a conversation I was having  the other day, that you have a big organization that ownership is detached from say running  that meat plant, right?  
**[0:08:52-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:08:52):**  Well, the ownership gives the manager a directive, make us money.  So he's just going to try to make as much money as possible and then the ownership can  come back two years later and say, you're spending $3,000 a month on tests.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:09:09):**  We don't think that that's necessary because the government says you only have to test  once a quarter.  So we want you to only test once a quarter and do away with all that daily testing.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:09:19):**  And then over the next several months, contamination gradually sneaks back into the plant where  they're not testing regularly.  And then they have a problem with consumers and they have to do a big recall, but the  
**[0:09:30-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:09:30):**  cost of the recall was probably less than the cost of the testing program.  Right.  I think that's a big part of corporate ag is that big corporations, that is their only  
**[0:09:45-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:09:45):**  goal is to make lots of money and they have a boardroom and that is all they're concerned  with.  I think it's up to the individuals within the industry to keep a reign on them in a  
**[0:10:01-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:10:01):**  certain sense.  We don't want to push them out.  I mean, they employ a lot of people and then they create a lot of food, but when you have  
**[0:10:11-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:10:11):**  one goal in mind to make as much money as possible, which I'm not saying that's not  what we should be doing.  All of our economic rules depend on that.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:10:28):**  I was an ag econ major in college.  Every single economic rule you have depends on people having a goal of making money.  So that's how supply and demand works.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:10:42):**  You have to have that.  But if you're completely railroading the way that business has been done and the history  of it, maybe we need to back up and take a look at that.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:10:57):**  Yeah, for sure.  I want to back up a little bit and let's go through some of your background.  Where are you from?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:05):**  You mentioned you have an ag econ degree.  Where did you get that?  West Texas A&M, Canyon, Texas.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:13):**  Okay.  So not too far from where you're at now.  No, no.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:17):**  I left for 20 years and then I came back.  I started out in Northeastern New Mexico, Clayton, New Mexico area.  That's where I grew up as a child.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:30):**  My dad bought and sold cattle for a living.  And I say that in admiration of him.  He bought cattle and he sold cattle.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:42):**  He did not have an order for those cattle.  He was never an order buyer and he was proud of that.  On his deathbed, he said, I never had an order.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:11:54):**  He bought cattle and he resold them.  You could do that back in the 70s and 80s and early 90s whenever he was the most active  in his career.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:12:05):**  He was a sale barn trader, which is a dirty word.  Nowadays, you're not even supposed to talk about things like that.  Most auction markets don't allow that anymore.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:12:17):**  But back in the day, you needed that.  You need speculators in any market to keep it fluid.  And when there wasn't a order there for a certain class of cattle or any type of livestock,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:12:33):**  he was the guy that would come in at some point and guarantee that there's a market.  But he did that all of his life.  He bought cattle in the country and resold those cattle to people with feedlot orders  
**[0:12:51-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:12:51):**  or directly to feedlots, bought calves in the country and sold them to backgrounders  in other areas.  But that's what he did.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:13:01):**  We had an auction for a while.  We had that in our blood.  My grandfather built the sale barn in Clayton, New Mexico that's been there and been running  
**[0:13:10-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:13:10):**  all these years.  He built it when he got back from World War II.  My maternal grandparents ranched south of Clayton.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:13:22):**  My grandfather's grandfather land rushed that ranch with his two brothers that had originally  come from the whales.  The other two brothers gave up in that dry sandy ranch and they sold out to him and eventually  
**[0:13:40-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:13:40):**  went and rode with Buffalo Bill and his Wild West show.  We've got tokens that they used to ride around in the tents and throw up in the air and Buffalo  Bill would shoot them.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:13:51):**  But we've got several of those tokens from Buffalo Bill shows that have bullet holes  in them.  Just came from there.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:14:02):**  I was a victim of a broken home.  Middle school age.  My mother and my sister and I moved over here south of Amarillo to Canyon, Texas.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:14:16):**  And my father moved to Clovis, New Mexico where he leased ranches and leased wheat pasture,  which it was only 80 some miles over there.  So I was over there all the time with him.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:14:28):**  I got out of high school.  I went to college because that's where the girls were at.  And I wouldn't have to work all the time if I went to college.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:14:38):**  So only on the weekends and when we were shipping or doing something like that.  So went to WT, majored in ag business and economics.  And I was too awfully worried about what I was going to do with that degree because I  
**[0:14:57-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:14:57):**  was just going to help my dad.  We were just going to buy cattle together and we were going to build an empire.  And I went to auctioneer school and I started dabbling in that.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:15:10):**  We turned our growing yard into a little sale barn.  And just about the time I was ready to get out of college, my father's health started  failing him in a big way.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:15:23):**  And so that changed everything.  And so the one thing that my father never did, he was a wheeler dealer at different  times.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:15:34):**  You know, when you're trading for a living, some days are good and sometimes are bad.  You're all in all the time.  He made a living by his wits.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:15:47):**  When things were down, you know, we were down when things were good, everything was great.  But he forgot to buy any land.  And I criticize him for that in his absence because we always leased our pastures, leased  
**[0:16:04-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:16:04):**  ranches to rent cattle on.  We owned growing yards and markets and things like that.  And I was never tied to a place.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:16:16):**  And in a way, in hindsight, looking back at that, that was a good thing because it was  easy for me to leave and get kind of a worldly view of the cattle markets, especially because  I was not anchored to a spot.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:16:34):**  And so whenever, when he started having some serious health problems, you know, I stayed  there and helped him.  But then he kind of got better over that, but was not well enough to really, you know,  
**[0:16:49-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:16:49):**  go back to branching out and really hustling like he used to do.  And so it was that time where I come to the realization that there was never going to  be enough gravy there for more than one spoon.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:17:00):**  And so I started getting more serious about this education that I've been getting.  And so I actually graduated with a BS in ag business and economics from West Texas A&M  and Canyon.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:17:17):**  I didn't see any jobs out there that I really thought I went to school four years to take.  I started working for meat grading part time, doing acceptance work and doing work on carcass  deliveries, CME deliveries.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:17:36):**  I was doing that and whenever I would have to turn in my time card or put my hours in,  anytime I had to go into the office, which I was mostly independent of beef plants around  the Amarillo area, I would go in there and I would see the market reporters that also  
**[0:17:55-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:17:55):**  worked for the ag marketing service.  That's kind of a sister agency with meat grading.  And I'd go in there and those guys were sitting at their desk with their feet up watching  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:18:06):**  video sales and things like that.  And I was thinking, I could do that.  I probably looked a lot easier.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah, I know everything that needs to do with that.  So I started talking to them about how I could get on and they said, well, the only way we  hire is through an internship program and you're already graduated.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:18:26):**  And I said, well, dang.  And so they said, but we do have a graduate intern program, but you got to compete nationwide  for one or two jobs.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:18:38):**  But anyway, I went back, I went to graduate school and applied for that graduate internship  and got one.  And I think there was two or three of us that were hired through the intern program that  
**[0:18:51-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:18:51):**  year and I was one of them.  And so then I started that.  They sent me to South Georgia for extended internship, which I loved because we ordered  
**[0:19:08-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:19:08):**  a lot of cattle out of the Southeast.  And I ran into buyers there that had bought cattle for us to send West that we would straighten  out and sell to people or run on grass or wheat pasture ourselves.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:19:23):**  So that was interesting.  I had a great trainer there, Ernie Morgan was an old time market man.  He was instrumental in the lean percentage figures on slaughter hogs.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:19:37):**  I learned a lot about that.  We graded hogs at hog buying stations back in those days.  That was in the mid nineties.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:19:46):**  I got done with that internship program.  I came back, I just had one or two hours of school left and they allowed me to work in  the Amarel office.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:19:55):**  So I worked there full time gathering information on feedlot sales.  That's back when we did it all over the phone instead of through the computer like they  do with mandatory price reporting.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:20:09):**  But we sat and called feedlots all day, every day, especially early in the week, trying  to get a reading on how big a show list they had to work with that week.  What they were kind of going to be asking for the cattle.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:20:26):**  And then as we got close to the middle part of the week, Wednesday and Thursday, we really  worked our phones hard trying to get that first guy that pulled the plug to sell the  cattle and what price levels.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:20:40):**  And then it was always a big deal each week when we got our first confirmed sales and  we'd run to our, at that time it was sprint mail.  We didn't really post it on the internet.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:20:51):**  We'd sprint mail it and then it would go to all those little readers that everybody had  that the media had that just ran all the time printing out information.  And we would put our first report out that we had confirmed sales and at what level.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:21:08):**  And then within 10 minutes, Cattle Facts would put out the same number and project 20,000  had sold.  So that was kind of the way that it worked every single week.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:21:20):**  But and that's kind of the way that goes, but we built relationships with the feedlots  at that time.  They sold a hundred thousand head in the Texas feedlot area every week, give or take eight  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:21:34):**  or 10,000.  That's fat cattle slaughter ready cows.  Okay.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:21:38):**  Fat cattle going to slaughter out of the feedlots.  Most of the feedlots, although some of them were corporate then most of them were custom  cattle feeding operations and the feedlot managers had grit.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:21:56):**  They played hard ball, they bargained with the packer buyers each week.  They worked, they negotiated, they tried to get all they could get every week for their  customers.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:22:07):**  They did the same thing in Kansas.  They'd sell them there a hundred thousand head in Kansas.  They did the same thing in Nebraska and that's the way business was done back in those days.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:22:18):**  And it hasn't been that long ago really if you think about it, that was in 96 when I  was doing that.  I left there shortly after back in those days, if you work for market news to advance, you  
**[0:22:35-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:22:35):**  had to transfer.  And so I transferred to South St. Paul, Minnesota.  I worked at the stockyards in South St. Paul half the time.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:22:47):**  And I worked at the cash grain floor at the Minneapolis grain exchange the other half  of the time.  That way I could pull relief for one or the other people that they were out.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:22:59):**  But it was the first time I'd really been exposed to a terminal market, an old time  river terminal market and selling fat cattle at auction.  And that was the nation's cow market at that time.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:23:12):**  They had a viable cow market five days a week.  And so we called a trend on that and it's amazing how much difference steady to firm  is or fully steady or steady to a dollar higher.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:23:29):**  It's amazing how much difference that made in the way people perceive the markets on  a daily cow market.  And like I said, that was the nation's cow market at that time.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:23:40):**  Learned a lot on the Minneapolis grain exchange on the cash floor.  We would have pie tins with samples from grain carts or trains of grain.  And you would have buyers come around and look at that grain and bid.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:23:56):**  It was actually a basis that they would bid.  It would be basis the board for dark Northern spring mostly, but also Durham wheat, but  learned a lot there.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:24:11):**  Hold up.  Some of these terms that you use, like I have the understanding of about a fifth grader  with, like when you get really deep into talking about marketing terms, I get lost.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:24:26):**  So bias the board, what the hell does that even mean?  Well, basis is what I said.  Basis not bias.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:24:32):**  Okay.  Well, basis is always the difference between your cash and your futures market.  So if they would bid, of course, now let's say, your Minneapolis spring week, which it's  
**[0:24:48-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:24:48):**  all out of Chicago now, but at that time on the floor, right down from where our office  was at on the floor, you had people in the pits, throwing their hands back and forth  bidding on it in Minneapolis, Minnesota, just like they did all the other products in Chicago  
**[0:25:08-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:25:08):**  other than Kansas city hard red winter wheat.  And they did that in Kansas city.  But if they came in there and they looked at your cash for, so that was totally different.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:25:19):**  That was a cash price.  And they were looking at samples of grain cars or trains of grain, and they were making  a bid, well, I mean, use today's quotes, let's say, your futures price was $12 a bushel,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:25:36):**  they would bid plus 35.  So that day, you know, if the seller would take it, and it was, you know, it was your  big grain companies that were buying and selling from each other, if they accepted that bid,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:25:54):**  we would close that price before the futures closed, but it was going to be plus 35.  Whatever the whatever the future close was, so it was if the futures closed at 12, the  cash price would be 1235.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:26:09):**  Okay.  Or it could be a negative basis, just depending on how your markets were, if it you know,  if it was, it was minus 35, then you would take it off on and then we would post that,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:26:22):**  that close on prices and sometimes we didn't sell sometimes we would close with a bid price  or an asking price.  But we did that all by hand.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:26:35):**  And it was on a ledger or clipboard just right outside our office.  And when the board indeed closed, people didn't really know what our what our basis bids were  that we were going to close with.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:26:49):**  Because we kept that in hand, we'd go around and interview the buyers and sellers, just  like they used to in the old stockyards when they sold everything private treaty, we would  have all that.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:27:02):**  And then we would go out and we would, we would post the close by writing it on this  board.  And sometimes there was nobody around, nobody cared.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:27:11):**  And sometimes people were hanging all over the top of each other, waiting for us to make  the strikes with our pencils, that it was it was interesting.  And then then there'd be a world of grain, wheat that would sell off of those prices  
**[0:27:25-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:27:25):**  that were established there on that cash grain floor.  It sounds like nobody can probably really understand how every how all the market forces  work and interact with each other and keep track everything.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:27:39):**  Not really.  And it's rare when you find fundamental people like myself, that's always been involved in  cash sales and cash markets.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:27:52):**  It's rare to find people that totally understand that and understand all the technical or the  squiggly lines on the graphs that all of your technical market analysts look at, you know,  when they're looking at head and shoulders and filling gaps and all that kind of thing.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:12):**  Very few people can do both.  I know just enough about the technical side to be dangerous.  And so I don't comment on it very often.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:20):**  But I'm totally fundamental.  And I'm totally a marketing guy when it comes to cattle.  Not so much on production, you know, even I just, it frightens me how much time most  
**[0:28:34-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:34):**  of your cattle producers spend on production.  And they don't spend enough on marketing.  I agree with that.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:43):**  And that's been a problem as long as I've been around in the cattle industry and probably  you too.  We're not good marketers.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:52):**  And we're not good market.  It's not our fault.  We're not good marketers.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:28:57):**  I mean, marketing is hard.  And you have to spend time on the things that, you know, that are going to keep you keep  the lights on a lot of times.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:29:05):**  And to some extent, that is marketing.  But I want to keep going back to is I think that we've just, us cattle producers were  sold a lie 40 odd years ago with the checkoff.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:29:19):**  And ever since then, our share of the, the producer share of the consumer beef dollar  has done nothing but fall since we've got the checkoff.  And the part of the lie was, is let us help you market that.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:29:33):**  Let us advertise for you.  We'll do a better job.  But yet we see the share of the consumer dollar keep falling and falling and falling.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:29:42):**  We've given up our marketing power to, you know, these giant conglomerates that have  all the power in the market and have basically evaporated the cash trade.  Yeah, they spent most of that money preaching to the choir.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:29:57):**  You know, you always always wondered why you would open up these cattle magazines, whether  it be a production top magazine or a market publication or anything, and you've got all  these ads in here for beef.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:30:12):**  Those people pretty much like beef, you know, I would rather see him put a billboard in  Times Square or something like that, to reach people that they know that we we don't necessarily  get our word to very often.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:30:28):**  But as you know, and I don't want to get too political on here, but most of those big ads  that are running those market publications are done for hush money.  As long as they are given a lot of advertising dollars in there with yours and mine, beef  
**[0:30:49-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:30:49):**  checkoff dollars, well, then they kind of control the message for that publication.  Yes.  You're a content creator.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:30:59):**  I'm a content creator.  My show is sponsored by my patrons.  So I don't have any corporate interest, any company telling me what I can and can't say.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:31:12):**  And I don't have to worry about upsetting anybody.  I just have to worry about keeping the people that listen to this podcast happy and hoping  they'll throw a few bucks my way every month.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:31:21):**  I knew that we were getting a pretty good following with the feeder flash whenever we  received an email to the headquarters, not to me, but to my boss's office that NCBA had  considerable amounts of money that they wanted to spend advertising in a way that we were  
**[0:31:48-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:31:48):**  putting out our message and that we were reaching producers that maybe they weren't having a  lot of success reaching.  And they continued to put in this email that they had considerable funds that they would  
**[0:32:01-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:32:01):**  like to push our way to help promote.  And we're like, yeah, that'd be great.  But once we put that little checkoff down in the corner of my videos, I've lost all  
**[0:32:12-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:32:12):**  my credibility.  And then whenever I decided to say the truth or the truth according to me, they may not  agree with that.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:32:23):**  And they'll pull that sponsorship dollar like that if they don't agree with you.  And yeah, that's why I like to remain independent, I think.  And I don't want anybody, if I upset my fans, they'll tell me.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:32:42):**  They'll tell me immediately and they'll tell me what they want to hear.  They'll tell me what I did wrong.  And I've got to listen to them.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:32:48):**  Right.  Well, and I do too for, to an extent, but we've got great sponsors at DV auction.  The way that we do our sponsorship is we offer it in packages.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:33:01):**  And I don't have to deal with that, which is great because we have guys that are professionals  at that.  We put packages together whether it's a drug company or feed additives or anything that  
**[0:33:16-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:33:16):**  any output that would want to get in front of cattle producers eyes.  They will run banner ads on production sales that are going on that are constantly going  across while the guy's sitting there shopping for bulls.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:33:32):**  And they may decide that they want a sponsorship on the feeder flash.  And they kind of know what they're getting into when they do it.  And we have great sponsors.  
**[0:33:43-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:33:43):**  I wouldn't say that my reports are that volatile, but at times people disagree with me.  And sometimes we've lost sponsors for that.  Sometimes we've gained sponsors for that.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:34:00):**  We had a animal health company that was a big sponsor of ours that was sponsoring all  kinds of stuff and loving it, getting a lot of positive feedback from their sponsorship.  They changed the supervisor.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:34:15):**  I came out against the jab mandate, the vaccine mandate, not for cattle, but just for, I was  just giving my point of view on the COVID vaccinations and was against that.  They immediately come out and said that was against their company policy and they pulled  
**[0:34:38-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:34:38):**  sponsorship, but that's fine.  We had others to fill in where they left off.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:34:48):**  I can't imagine why NCBA would be having trouble reaching some producers that you'd have a  different audience than they would.  That just seems really odd.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:34:58):**  I was talking about this with another friend yesterday.  So we have NCBA, we have RCAF and we have US Cattlemen's Association.  I'd really like to see on a map where all of their members are and how big of an operation  
**[0:35:18-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:35:18):**  they are and what type.  It seems like NCBA's membership is going to be mostly full of feeders and small cattle  operators in the east.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:35:29):**  RCAF is going to be your big cow-calf guys in the Northern Plains and USCA is Southern  Plains and Southwest.  And again, more cow-calf guys.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:35:39):**  Yeah, actually the US Cattlemen's Association, which I am affiliated with.  I work with them some and I'm actually on some of their committees and I support them  in almost everything that they do.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:35:59):**  I don't know how many years ago it's been, four or five years ago, they asked if I would  come do a presentation and it was one of the first presentations that I did for hire.  They asked if I would come talk to them about some different issues that were affecting  
**[0:36:17-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:36:17):**  the markets and the industry and things like that.  When I went up to the US Cattlemen's Association, I was surprised to find that I did not find  pot bellies and cheap suits.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:36:33):**  I found cattle guys, producers, who shit on their boots and wore out jeans and maybe a  dated blazer because they were trying to fix up a little bit, but wore out hats and just  salt to the earth type of people.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:36:53):**  But they're actually pulling their producers from the same place that RCAF is.  It's mostly Northern Plains, mostly Mountain States, even going back West as far as Washington  state, but very, very few Southern Plains people and hardly any Southeastern people.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:37:16):**  So RCAF and US Cattlemen pull their members from basically the same pool.  Of course, you're going to have a few people coming in once in a while, but your Southern  Plains is almost entirely NCBA, but it also is some of your affiliates that have gotten  
**[0:37:41-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:37:41):**  tired of NCBA policy and are kind of looking for a home.  As opposed to Kansas Livestock Association, which runs NCBA along with Texas Cattle Feeders  Association, you have a Kansas Cattlemen's Association, which is people looking for other  
**[0:38:01-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:38:01):**  direction.  They're looking for a breath of fresh air, another policy.  And they kind of split between RCAF and US Cattlemen's Association.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:38:12):**  And you have several of those grassroots organizations that do that.  I let my membership for Kansas Cattlemen's go.  I've never been a member of KLA, but I'm definitely a paid up member of RCAF.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:38:28):**  Maybe I should go get that Kansas Cattlemen's Association membership renewed.  But NCBA, no, no, they don't get my membership dollars.  They have to get my checkoff dollars, but I don't have to send them any membership dollars.  
**[0:38:46-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:38:46):**  But if you were talking to someone from NCBA, they would say, well, those are not our dollars.  You know that, but it's funny that those dollars make up 70% of their budget.  You know that those dollars are really allocated from the state beef boards.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:39:06):**  But though many of those state beef boards are really inbred with the affiliates of NCBA.  And they'll throw a few dollars here and there.  They haven't thrown too many dollars at Bill Bullard and not that he wants or needs them.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:39:26):**  They have thrown a few dollars to US Cattlemen's Association.  As they're sitting on tens of millions of dollars, they'll throw them a hundred thousand  a year or maybe 150,000 a year to work on a project or something like that.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:39:41):**  But maybe buy a little silence too.  Yeah.  Well, it's not working if that's what they're spending it on.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:39:50):**  Oh goodness.  Okay.  So we can talk about markets all day.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:39:59):**  We can talk about problems in the markets all day.  How do we fix it?  Well, as your listeners, I assume most of them understand.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:40:14):**  It's very technical and there's just a lot of different things coming in from every direction  of the field that affects these markets.  And a couple of years ago, two and a half years ago, I was at a US Cattlemen's Association  
**[0:40:34-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:40:34):**  event in Billings, Montana.  We were getting together with some of the more outspoken members there, including Justin  Tupper who owns St. Angel's Livestock in St. Onge, South Dakota.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:40:54):**  Lee Richmond, who is a cattle farmer feeder in Nebraska.  There were several of us around there and we were ruminating on a ribeye that we had  just completed and we were enjoying adult beverages at Jake's Steakhouse there in downtown  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:41:16):**  Billings, Montana.  And somebody said that exact thing.  We're losing our markets.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:41:23):**  How do we fix it?  And we hem hard around there for a little bit and they asked me what I thought.  Being in my position, which I haven't been with USDA for eight years now.  
**[0:41:42-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:41:42):**  I don't have any sour grapes about my time there or leaving USDA because it afforded  me so much opportunity to learn.  I mentioned after I was in South St. Paul, Minnesota, after there, I went to supervise  
**[0:42:00-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:42:00):**  a one man office in New Holland, Pennsylvania in Lancaster County where the Amish and Mennonite  trade is and went to Fat Cattle Options there and then got moved back to St. Joseph, Missouri,  where I spent most of my career in St. Joseph, Missouri.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:42:18):**  And I got moved in there whenever they started mandatory price reporting.  And I moved there to work on mandatory price reporting.  And I helped publish some of the very first reports from NPR and then moved back into  
**[0:42:33-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:42:33):**  voluntary reporting with the federal state program.  But I was able to see a lot of different angles of that.  I've reported markets in Montana and Nebraska and all over the country in Kansas.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:42:49):**  But I told them, I said, you've got to have more negotiated trade.  We are losing all of our negotiated trade.  From the time in the mid 90s when I was in the Amarillo office working and we were gathering  
**[0:43:04-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:43:04):**  all the trade with a big yellow legal notepad and a fat pencil to having all that information  turned in automatically, it actually ramped up the loss of negotiated trade and the formula  deals and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:43:24):**  And we were just we're just losing it so fast.  We've got the tail wagging the dog here.  When you've got over 90% of your cattle selling off of what less than 10% brain, how much  
**[0:43:38-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:43:38):**  sense does that make?  How much effort does it take to manipulate that small price?  In 2015, after the big prices of 2014, but in the record 2015, less than 3% of the cattle  
**[0:43:55-0:44:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:43:55):**  of the fat cattle in Texas sold in a negotiated manner.  Was that a guess?  2.6% of all the finished cattle in Texas feedlot areas, which includes Oklahoma, Panhandle,  
**[0:44:09-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:44:09):**  and Eastern New Mexico, 2.6% of them sold negotiated.  97.4 sold off of those.  That is an unhealthy market.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:44:24):**  That's unreal.  It's absolutely mind boggling.  And yet, we've got Texas cattle feeders Association, KLA and NCBA wanting, they think that there's  
**[0:44:36-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:44:36):**  no problem with that.  There's no problem with that.  Is Packers dictating what you get for the cattle and getting the negotiated trade price  
**[0:44:48-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:44:48):**  so small that you can manipulate it with $100 bill under the table.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Well, this is what I was telling them at US Cattlemen's Association.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:00):**  I said, we've got to preserve this negotiated trade.  We're losing it all in Texas.  It's very small in Kansas.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:10):**  It's still healthy in Iowa and Nebraska, Colorado is just about done.  We've got to preserve that negotiated trade.  You've got to have that bid ask relationship.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:25):**  And when I give my presentations, I always say, it's like those American junk hunters,  what do they call them?  American pickers.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:38):**  Those picker guys.  You ever watch those guys?  I love that show.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:43):**  They go into somebody's basement and they hold up a piece of junk.  And as they hold that piece of junk up and blow the dirt off of it, the guy that owns  that piece of junk that forgot that he even owned it, all of a sudden that piece of junk  
**[0:45:57-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:45:57):**  becomes very important to him.  And he realizes that it's more valuable maybe than what he thought it was.  And so they're saying, well, what do you want for this?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:46:08):**  And he has no idea and he doesn't want to price it too cheap.  Well, I don't know.  What would you give me for it?  
**[0:46:13-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:46:13):**  And that back and forth right there, the human element of trade is what we've got to preserve.  If we don't have that, that's not a market.  That's not price discovery.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:46:28):**  You have to have a bid ask.  It's just like in an auction, the auctioneer is the one doing the haggling.  The product is there in front of them.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:46:38):**  You've got the guys bidding on the product and they're bidding against each other, but  you can do it in a fast mode with the auctioneer doing the haggling for you.  So, and there's a lot of things and I love auctions.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:46:53):**  I love auctioneering, but I just love all the mind games that are going on in a 30 second  draft of auction sale.  And I love that.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:47:05):**  And I love sitting and watching auctions, knowing who's buying what, who's pushing on  them.  And a lot of guys, and I've heard Steve Stratford say it, and Justin Tupper has been famous  
**[0:47:18-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:47:18):**  for saying it, the guy that comes in second in the auction.  He's probably as important as anybody or definitely is.  He pushed them to that level.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:47:30):**  And you've got guys that'll just sit in an auction and push just out of onriness.  And that's awesome.  You've got to have that.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:47:39):**  And your cow buyers are the best.  We've still got a really viable negotiated trade in slaughtered cow markets.  The bulk of them are still sold in auctions.  
**[0:47:51-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:47:51):**  And my best friends that I grew up with, he's a cow buyer for a major cow kill.  And he tells me, he said, I went to this particular auction that has a lot of slaughter cows and  I never had an order.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:48:10):**  My order was not to get over a load.  And I said, well, what'd you go for?  And he said, just to push, just to keep the other guys honest.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:48:19):**  And I think when we don't have that in a fat cow arena, we need something like that in  your fat cow arena.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:48:27):**  So you said that cow trade, there's still a lot of cash discovery in the cow trade.  And we've been talking about, we've mentioned grids and formulas.  Now I'll admit, I think I have about a 2% understanding of how those things work.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:48:44):**  And my understanding is like, okay, so you have a grid or a formula and they're based  on what the carcass yields and grades, right?  And pounds.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:48:54):**  And the price that they pay for those pounds is determined on what the cash market is.  But if less than 15%, I mean, and I guess sometimes that 15% fat cattle cash trade,  that number can kind of be up for debate.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:49:10):**  Like you said in 2015, less than 3% of the cattle in Texas, fat cattle in Texas traded  on cash basis.  Where are these cash trades actually happening for fat cattle?  
**[0:49:23-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:49:23):**  Like are they all concentrated in one or two barns or is it like, do all the regions have  those?  Those do not include auctions.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:49:31):**  So in the Southern Plains, in Kansas and in Texas, there are no fed cattle auctions.  There used to be though, right?  Well, sure there used to be at one time, but that went direct, went to direct trade.  
**[0:49:47-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:49:47):**  As soon as your feedlots moved out into the great American desert.  Back when we had our terminal markets like Chicago and Omaha and Sioux city and Sioux  Falls, and then they were real viable back in the 30s, 40s, 50s and early 60s, all your  
**[0:50:04-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:50:04):**  trade was negotiated, but it was a private treaty sale on the yards.  Well when they started in the 60s, moving your cattle feeding out to Western Kansas  and the Texas Panhandle and places like that, your feedlot started being built out there.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:50:25):**  Your guys in the Midwest, it was all farmer feeders at that time.  They got tired of fighting the mud all the time.  They found out that even though there wasn't that much feed in the Texas Panhandle and  
**[0:50:38-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:50:38):**  there wasn't very many cattle there, transportation was getting efficient enough that you could  haul feed and you can haul cattle to set of pins on the hillside with a feed mill and  some bunk and you can feed them more efficiently there than you could on the farm.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:50:58):**  At that time everybody talks about P&S not enforcing things.  Back when we were at the stockyards, you had P&S agents walking the alleys, packers and  stockyards agents, making sure everything was on the up and up, making sure that nobody  
**[0:51:14-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:51:14):**  was getting an unfair advantage or anything like that.  People think that your stockyards trade was just willy-nilly and there's nothing going  to be further from the truth.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:51:26):**  The P&S guys were on top of things all the time.  They had relationships with the buyers and sellers.  If something wasn't right, they were going to get informed about it.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:51:36):**  They had rules at the stockyards back in those days.  Your packers couldn't just and your packer buyers were all friends with the commission  guys but I have a good story, a good friend of mine whose dad had a commission firm at  
**[0:51:51-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:51:51):**  Omaha at the stockyards and he was really good friends with the main packer buyer at  one of the packers and he asked his dad when he was a kid, he said, dad how come we don't  hang out with Bob when we're at the stockyards?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:52:07):**  You guys go fishing together and you guys go to ball games, you drink together and do  all that kind of thing.  He says, how come we don't hang out with Bob when we're at the stockyards?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:52:17):**  His dad said, son, Bob is a packer buyer.  Why would I want to talk to him when I know that he's going to lie to me?  He's my good friend and I like Bob but we're not going to talk when we're at the stockyards.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:52:32):**  It's a great story and it sums up the relationship between your packers and your feeders but  your packer buyers just couldn't go into the yards and just start running around willy-nilly  bidding on cattle.  
**[0:52:48-0:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:52:48):**  If they did, your biggest packer, let's say it was Swift or Armor at that time, all they  had to do is run them across the street or up a chute to get them into their plant.  They would run to the commission guy who had the most cattle or who had the best cattle  
**[0:53:03-0:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:53:03):**  and he would sop all those cattle up and then the guys that didn't have as many or weren't  quite as good, they'd be sucking hind tit.  Well that wasn't the way and they used to talk about when the bell rang and let's say  
**[0:53:16-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:53:16):**  at nine o'clock they'd say the bell rang then your packers could enter the yards and at  that time they would draw out of somebody's hat, they would draw their commission firm  and that's where they started.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:53:31):**  They would start at that commission firm and then there was a rotation after that.  So maybe your biggest packer drew the smallest commission firm and the guy who had the plainest  cattle or the fewest cattle, that's where he had to start buying and people didn't have  
**[0:53:45-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:53:45):**  cell phones, they didn't know what was going on on the other side of the yards and so he  had to start trying to buy those cattle and by the time he worked his way around to the  commission firm that he would have liked to have started on, likely those cattle would  
**[0:54:00-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:54:00):**  be all gone by then.  That kept everything on an even playing field.  Now what few cattle that your packers bid on which it's all done in the country for  
**[0:54:12-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:54:12):**  the most part, we do have the fed cattle exchange which I support through central stockyards  where they offer cattle online but it's had a limited amount of success.  I would say if we get this bill pushed through they could have some more because that would  
**[0:54:28-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:54:28):**  be one way that you could buy cattle in a negotiated manner but especially down here  in Texas if they only have to negotiate on about 10% of the cattle, you can send a simple  text, the packer buyers send text back and forth each other, they collude, they gang  
**[0:54:48-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:54:48):**  up on the few guys that sell cash cattle and they keep the market under pressure all the  time.  They're bidding 136 on cattle this morning and we've got cattle selling for 144 in Nebraska  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:55:05):**  and Iowa.  Eight cents spread.  So what explains that?  
**[0:55:09-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:55:09):**  They are better but they're not that much better and it's just that the guys in Iowa  and Nebraska, they've got negotiating leverage.  They've got their better cattle and they've got deals that they want and they've got the  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:55:25):**  regional packers.  That's the most important thing is they've got those guys that will come in second a  lot of times.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:55:32):**  They've got regional packers that don't have as many big sweetheart deals and they aren't  tied into these big corporate feeding outfits that supply them with over 80% of their needs.  They need to buy cattle in the open market and most of them feature a higher quality  
**[0:55:51-0:56:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:55:51):**  product and so they'll go after those better cattle and they'll go after volume of cattle  when they're short bought but we can talk about all these sweetheart deals in the southern  plains and a lot of these people think that's the only way they can get a true price for  
**[0:56:08-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:56:08):**  their cattle is get into some sweetheart deal.  The only real premium down here is volume.  Whenever you've got one cattle feeding enterprise that's going to supply you with in some instances  
**[0:56:26-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:56:26):**  over three-fourths of your needs for a particular facility of a big four packer, how valuable  is he to you?  He gives you almost everything you need and then all you have to do is just pick around  
**[0:56:43-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:56:43):**  the edges for the rest.  That's not a fair way to trade and it's really limited the upside of our fed cattle price  and then it's trickled down.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:56:56):**  It's limited our yearling price and our calf price for our cow-calf producers and that's  why the share of the retail dollar over the last 30 years has gone from the 60 cent percentile  down in the 30 cent percentile.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:57:19):**  You mentioned some legislation so let's talk about some legislation that's coming through.  We've got Fisher-Grassley which I guess has become the compromise bill now and we've got  50-14.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:57:34):**  I think that's it.  I don't think there's any movement on Cory Booker's bill to ban CAFOs.  What do you know?  
**[0:57:42-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:57:42):**  I think that's actually part of your 50-14 bill there.  I mentioned that we were visiting with this at a US Cattlemen's Association meeting and  they said, what do we got to do?  
**[0:57:58-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:57:58):**  And I said, well, we've got to preserve, maintain and grow our negotiated cash trade and everybody  agreed and most all of these smaller grassroots associations like Nebraska Cattlemen's and  Iowa Cattlemen's, they had policy that they supported at least 50% negotiated cash but  
**[0:58:22-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:58:22):**  they weren't doing anything with it and nobody was really doing anything with it.  And so they said, well, let's see what we can get done on Capitol Hill.  Let's see what we can get done.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:58:37):**  Let's try to mandate a minimum percentage negotiated cash trade and several of us including  me says, how the hell are you going to do that?  You can't tell them how to do business.  
**[0:58:52-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:58:52):**  That's against our conservative values.  That pushes me off my mark a little bit.  You know what?  
**[0:59:01-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:59:01):**  I don't really like that.  And they said, well, let's see.  In Texas at that time, they were trading about 7% negotiated cash trade.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:59:09):**  We said these four packers are taking that 7% and they're entering in it to all these  AMAs we're seeing now, these alternative marketing agreements, these formula trades, the sweetheart  deals.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:59:24):**  They're using that as a base price.  They are totally exploiting that number.  And some of them are not participating in the establishment of that minimum negotiated  
**[0:59:36-0:59:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:59:36):**  trade.  So if they're not participating, especially with each location that they have, and they're  exploiting that number, we've got a chance right here that we can mandate that they participate  
**[0:59:52-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=0:59:52):**  in that number that they are using.  And so we started pushing on it.  Everybody wanted 50 at the beginning.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:02):**  And then the 14 is that's on cash trades with delivery within 14 days.  So it's a current deal.  So the 50-14 is what we immediately started pushing.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:15):**  Well, I told the guys, and it's not all me.  Everybody had a play in it.  I'm just coming from my point of view.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:21):**  I said, I don't think 50 will work because it's too aggressive.  I said, I think we'd be a lot safer with 30 because at 30% that allows your big corporate  feeders.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:36):**  They're not going to change the, we're not going to be able to upset the whole apple  cart.  Your big corporate feeders that are in line with an individual packer, we don't want to  
**[1:00:49-1:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:49):**  force them out of business.  And we're not meaning to change the way that they're doing their business, but we need  to leave them room.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:00:58):**  So we needed to leave them room to do business as they want to do it.  And we also need to leave room for these people that are in these branded programs.  The way the branded programs work is a packer goes to an individual cattle feeder or producer,  
**[1:01:18-1:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:01:18):**  and they says, your cattle are just too good.  They're so much better than your neighbors cattle, because you're so much smarter than  your neighbor and you're doing such a good job with your genetics and you're feeding  
**[1:01:32-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:01:32):**  the cattle superior to him and your cattle are just way better than your neighbors.  And so we really want to put them in our Excalibur gold and diamond ranch program.  And man, the guy feels so good about it.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:01:46):**  And he's like, really, you want to put mine in there?  And he says, yes.  And he says, here's sign this right here and promising all your cattle to us.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:01:57):**  You're not going to take bids from any other packer.  We're going to buy them.  We're going to base them off the five area weighted average, and then we'll give you  
**[1:02:06-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:02:06):**  premiums and discounts after that.  And then, you know, then we're going to give you this deal to hang on the wall that says  you're in the Excalibur golden diamond program and you're one of the very, very few that  
**[1:02:18-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:02:18):**  has cattle good enough to do that.  And he says, sure, where do I sign?  And then as the back of buyers driving off his place, he calls his boss and he says,  
**[1:02:26-1:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:02:26):**  yeah, we got all his cattle tied up too.  And that's the way those branded programs go on.  But they make those guys feel so good because they make them believe that they are smarter  
**[1:02:38-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:02:38):**  than their neighbor down the road.  And just by nature, your cattle feeders are so competitive that that's what they want  to do.  
**[1:02:49-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:02:49):**  And they always talk about plus in the market.  Well, you know, I spent $30,000 on a bull and then on I've maintained ownership of these  cattle all the way through and I've done such a great job of it and all this kind of stuff.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:03:04):**  And I plus the market.  And what does that mean?  Well, instead of my cattle brand 136, they brought 136.35.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:03:15):**  And I don't really care that if I would have teamed up with some of my other producers,  we might could have got 138 or 140 because I got 35 cents a hundred more than my neighbor.  And that's really all I care about.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:03:29):**  And that's the way that the competitive nature of cattle feeding is done while you've got  four packers over there.  And I've always said it's easier to get four heads together than it is 400 or 4000.  
**[1:03:43-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:03:43):**  And they're keeping the market under wraps all the time.  And of course, you know, they're making billions and billions of dollars every quarter, having  the best that they've ever had, the best return they've ever had.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:04:01):**  And you've got cattle feeders going out of business.  And trickling down, you got backgrounders that can't make any money.  And you got cow cow people that can't maintain their property.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:04:13):**  And so that that opens a door to talk about the cow herd numbers and the way they've been  declining.  Is that is that a worry for the next few years in the beef business?  
**[1:04:27-1:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:04:27):**  With I think it's an opportunity, you know.  And that's basically a cycle.  You know, ag people, you give a farmer a rancher a market, an attractive market, and he'll  
**[1:04:44-1:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:04:44):**  flood it as fast as he can possibly do it.  That's what he does.  Flood it and screw up the price.  
**[1:04:51-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:04:51):**  Yes.  And that's the way that's the way that goes.  So you know, we're in the cycle now where, you know, we it's gotten hard times.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:00):**  And when you when you're talking about farming or ranching has so much to do with drought.  And we've had serious, serious droughts in some of our major production areas, South  Dakota, North Dakota.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:14):**  Being the biggest one, you know, they there's a lot of big ranches up there.  And and as they start calling that herd calling that herd, because they can't, you know, they  don't have the forage to support those cattle.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:29):**  Well then slowly, it's going to start affecting our production and then our production goes  down.  The price will go back up with supply and demand.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:39):**  And we're going to we're going to see some really, really attractive prices for calves  and yearlings.  I don't know if we have we don't have the we I know we don't have the leverage to get  
**[1:05:51-1:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:51):**  the fed cattle market where it should go with these tighter numbers because they've got  such a control on it.  They'll keep it under wraps.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:05:59):**  But you know, your cattle, your background is in your cattle feeders are eternal optimists.  And so they're going to be betting on the come thinking how good it's going to be.  And we're going to see some really, really attractive prices.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:06:15):**  And I hope we get some of this cattle price discovery and Transparency Act legislation  pushed through the system before that starts happening, because as soon as our producers  and our feeders start making a little bit of money, they're going to totally forget  
**[1:06:31-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:06:31):**  about all this.  Yeah, yeah.  So what's that?  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:06:35):**  What's the price discovery and Transparency Act?  What will that do?  And how will that affect the cash trade situation?  
**[1:06:43-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:06:43):**  Okay, what what?  It is and it is a compromise, but most of your opponents use that compromise, because  they they they like to use the term because it's showing that we're giving in.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:06:59):**  Well, so you had your 5014 bill with Charles Grassley.  And I and I respect and admire Charles Grassley so much, because he works for his constituents.  And he's been there for a long, long time.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:07:16):**  And and one of his biggest supporters has been the Iowa Cattlemen's Association.  And we still have farmer feeders in Iowa.  And it affects a large portion of the small communities in the in the rural part of Iowa  
**[1:07:31-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:07:31):**  to keep that viable.  And so Chuck Grassley understands that he always has, and he's always pushed for that  negotiated trade to remain active and, and have a good market where people can afford  
**[1:07:44-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:07:44):**  to feed cattle and, and walk their their grain to town is what they say it gives them another  option to market their grain, which a lot of them do.  So he was for 5014.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:07:57):**  And a lot of people say that that the results of this bill are the people that are pushing  that don't want 5014.  Hell, I wanted 5014.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:08:06):**  I'd like 107.  You know, I mean, it'd be great, but we can't get it.  It doesn't do any good.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:08:14):**  And as much as I admire so much of the archive movement and everything, they are famous for  biting off more than they can chew.  They push for things that they know they're not going to get just to raise awareness and  
**[1:08:28-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:08:28):**  things like that.  We got an opportunity to get this bill passed and legislation and make it a law.  So so so let's say I was I and us at US Cattlemen's Association, we're thinking that 3014 would  
**[1:08:44-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:08:44):**  be a better way to do it.  So then we had Deb Fisher, who is a grew up on a ranch.  She's a rancher in Nebraska.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:08:54):**  And she thought, well, this this 3014 sounds like something that we can get because let's  say right now, which is true, I was still negotiating about half their cattle, about  50 percent.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:09:06):**  And Nebraska is about 33.  So so naturally, that 30 percent sounded doable to her.  And as we started trying to get that, they got a lot of pushback, of course, and mostly  
**[1:09:23-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:09:23):**  from the North American Meat Institute and NCBA, which North American Meat Institute  is the association.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:09:31):**  North American Meat Institute is just a mouthpiece for the Packers.  Exactly.  They they they.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:09:37):**  Yeah, absolutely.  And it's no happenstance that some of your biggest official and officials in USDA get  a nice cushy job with NAMI whenever they retire.  
**[1:09:51-1:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:09:51):**  Oh, no, that's perfectly OK.  That's yeah, that's fine.  It's just the way that your military leaders get to have Chrissy Jobs with those defense  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:01):**  contractors whenever they retire.  You know, it's natural.  Totally no conflict of interest.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:07):**  Totally not a conflict.  So as as Deb Fisher started working through her bill, she saw she was getting a lot of  pushback.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:17):**  Of course, Chuck Grassi was getting a lot of pushback, too.  But both of them wanted to wanted to preserve at least what negotiated trade we have right  now and not let it go any further down.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:31):**  And so it did compromise.  And they decided what and what the cattle price discovery and Transparency Act is, is  it will freeze within the five area, at least.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:44):**  And they're probably going to establish two more areas to encompass the other the other  parts of the country.  So it's going to be five to seven area regionally.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:10:56):**  They're going to preserve the percentage of negotiated trade that we have right now or  what we've had over the last two years.  And actually, in Texas, that's going to be a little better than what we've been historically,  
**[1:11:10-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:11:10):**  because during the worst of the pandemic, we did see some decent negotiated trade in  Texas, because we found out that some of those sweetheart deals that your big corporate feeders  in Texas are enjoying with their packers include profit sharing, and box beef cutout values.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:11:32):**  So they refused to take some of their cattle.  Whenever we saw the biggest disparage when it when the shelves were empty and housewives  were fighting over a pound of hamburger, they decided to let those cattle set.  
**[1:11:46-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:11:46):**  And they were going to these smaller cattle feeders, little custom lots and things like  that that had cattle that were in loose hands, that hadn't seen a major packer come to their  place for years and years and decades.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:12:00):**  And they were saying, hey, you know, I'll give you I'll give you so much for these cattle.  Well, sure, you know, what's the catch here?  Meanwhile, those guys that had the had the sweetheart deals are sitting on their cattle,  
**[1:12:12-1:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:12:12):**  because they would have cost too much if they turned them in on the on the sweetheart deal  with the profit sharing or the or the or the the dress beef price.  So then they let those get over finished, and they did the hell out of them.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:12:29):**  Exactly.  And then they're their old sweetheart buddies, you know, and those guys will fight for them  to the end, because they really have to have them.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:12:37):**  And if you're feeding 250,000 cattle, or half a million cattle or a million cattle, like  like five rivers is for JVS.  I mean, you can't operate without your sweetheart deal because you've got like, you know, you've  
**[1:12:52-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:12:52):**  got way too many cattle to sell, you have to be able to schedule them in all the time.  And I can't stress enough how fearful I don't care if it's five rivers, all the way down  to your smallest farmer feeder in Iowa, they are scared to death of their packer, because  
**[1:13:11-1:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:13:11):**  they can shut them off.  They can absolutely and then they do that, that they penalize them all the time.  I have a lot of friends, especially up in the Midwest, that get frustrated with the  
**[1:13:22-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:13:22):**  fed cattle market.  And they'll tweet or put a Facebook post out on critical of your of your packers.  And and whenever they get ready to sell cattle, they said, Well, you need to take that post  
**[1:13:34-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:13:34):**  down.  Yeah, you know, they're always pulling rank on and they are so fearful of them.  And that's why you see all your big cattle feeders in Kansas and Texas, fighting tooth  
**[1:13:49-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:13:49):**  and nail against this cattle price discovery and transparency act, and they have to be  vocal about it so that their packer see that there are good minions and they're following  what they what they should be doing for them.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:03):**  But going back to cattle price discovery and transparency, what it will do is it will freeze  the percentage levels that we have right now.  Which doesn't sound great to a lot of guys that want more negotiated trade, including  
**[1:14:19-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:19):**  me.  But one thing that they're forgetting is that it will freeze those percentages per packer  location.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:29):**  So right now, what little negotiated trade we see in the Southern Plains is mostly done  by just a few plants.  Well, if you take some of those plants that don't do anything but schedule cattle in,  
**[1:14:43-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:43):**  we've got we've got plants, big four plants in Texas panhandle that don't have a packer  buyer.  They don't have a fat cattle buyer.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:51):**  They don't have a procurement office.  They don't have anybody to do that because they're just the ones that just scheduled  cattle in.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:14:59):**  They just all five rivers and say, I need five pot loads on Thursday.  Yeah, that's all they do.  They basically own the cattle.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:15:07):**  But packers are not supposed to own cattle.  But if I've got a contract that they're mine, I do.  And that's what they have with these ama's or these these formula deals.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:15:20):**  But whenever we bring those other locations that haven't been active in negotiated trade  up to that to that low percentage level, and let's say if we did it in Texas, it's probably  going to be it's probably going to freeze at about 8%.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:15:36):**  Which 8% ain't shit.  Not great.  It's a lot better than 2.6.  
**[1:15:42-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:15:42):**  Or zero, which is what Texas A&M research says it will be by 2026.  If we don't do something, we will go to zero negotiated trade in Texas.  So what's your cattle worth then?  
**[1:15:56-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:15:56):**  Whatever they feel like paying.  Exactly.  Well, it's, it's not a lot different than today.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:16:01):**  But at least there are some areas where there is a cash trade to support a little bit more  price discovery.  Exactly.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:16:11):**  And, and, you know, there's always say there's no trade, there's a lot of bigger feeding  outfits that they their cattle don't go into negotiated trade.  They're feeding Mexican cattle, or they're feeding coon shit, or they're feeding something  
**[1:16:36-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:16:36):**  that's not all that great.  They're not that desired, but they do hang on the hooks, and they do make beef.  And and, you know, it's a product that your packers need.  
**[1:16:48-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:16:48):**  Well, they'll sell their cattle the high for the week.  So they'll promise them a big volume of cattle.  And the price they get is the highest price that anybody else is negotiating for within  
**[1:17:03-1:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:17:03):**  that area.  And they may not let loose of the cattle unless they, they like you know what's going on.  So in a way those are at least they're negotiating their volume.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:17:21):**  But a pure negotiated cash sale in Texas is rare and hard to find.  Okay.  So I'm always watching input costs, especially fuel costs, price of oil.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:17:38):**  Have we started to see any effects on the cattle market of $5 diesel fuel or is that  train wreck still coming at us?  It's here and it's still coming and it's progressively working on us.  
**[1:17:55-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:17:55):**  This week and last week, we've noticed that you would think that our feeder cattle prices  would be going down progressively so because our feedlots are full, we know that.  And there's just not a lot of demand to fill empty pens because there's not that many empty  
**[1:18:17-1:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:18:17):**  pens right now.  But we also at the same time know that once we get into full summer here within the next  month or so, for at least two months there, there's not going to be very many feeder cattle  
**[1:18:29-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:18:29):**  to buy and you guys want to stay in.  Well we're starting to see a significant premium in the northern plains and in the Midwest  for feeder cattle to go right on to feed them.  
**[1:18:42-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:18:42):**  We're seeing in the southern plains because these farmer feeders and these smaller feeding  outfits, they've got access to corn and a lot of them still have on-farm corn storage.  And you would think, well gosh, why don't they haul it to town and get $8 a bushel for  
**[1:19:03-1:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:03):**  it?  Well, they'll have to give it to Uncle Sam and they don't want to do that.  They would rather put it through those cattle and build the equity in their cattle feeding  
**[1:19:15-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:15):**  operation by doing it that way.  So and because of freight, we are starting to see those cattle in the northern plains,  which they always sell at a premium because I mean it's a fact of life.  
**[1:19:28-1:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:28):**  It may hurt people's feelings, but the cattle in Nebraska are better than the cattle in  Texas.  They just are.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:37):**  Little bigger grades and yield.  You're looking for grading, which that's what the whole world revolves around average choice  or better.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:46):**  You're looking for grading, the cattle are better.  And so they're going to bring a premium, but they're starting to bring more of a premium  because of freight.  
**[1:19:55-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:19:55):**  And we're starting to see that and I have to harp on one of my other big pet peeves  is we've got to have more fall calving.  Right now and historically, 75% of the calves born in the United States are born the first  
**[1:20:18-1:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:20:18):**  half of the year.  You think, well, that's not too bad until you look at the second half of the year and  you say only 25% of our calves are born the second half of the year.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:20:31):**  Well, what time of year do you like to eat steak?  I like it year round.  Yeah, well, so does everybody else and globally especially because you know, other parts of  
**[1:20:45-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:20:45):**  the year are enjoying different seasons, you know, on the other side of the globe, of course.  And our cattle infrastructure can't handle 75% of our calves coming to them at the same  time.  
**[1:21:02-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:21:02):**  We don't have the pen space to hold them all at one time or over a majority of them at  one time.  We don't have the pen space.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:21:12):**  We don't have the hooks to hang them on and we definitely don't have the trucks to haul  them off.  So in the fall of the year in October, which everybody winter calves anymore, they don't  
**[1:21:26-1:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:21:26):**  spring calve, they winter calve so that they can have as big of a big pussy fat calf balling  to sell when it comes October.  And every year in October, your supply of big fat soggy calves balling outweighs demand  
**[1:21:47-1:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:21:47):**  and the market goes down.  And you know, if you're turning your bulls out at the same time as your neighbor and  you always have and you always and they'll always help each other brand the same week  
**[1:22:00-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:00):**  and you do everything the same as each other, how smart is that?  You need to get out of step a little bit with your production cycle because it's clogging  up our infrastructure in the fall of the year with all these big fat calves.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:16):**  I can 100% see your point and there's arguments to be made about, you know, when the calf  calve on green grass, calve in the spring, summer, fall.  I've seen those cows lay down on green grass and have a calf.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:28):**  It doesn't have to be a snow drift or muddle.  They can do it on green grass.  A lot of people don't believe that.  
**[1:22:35-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:35):**  Yeah.  And, and, you know, I found that they'll actually have calves out in the pasture just as good  as they'll have them if they're standing in a dry lot.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:44):**  Absolutely.  Don't think, don't think these big corporate feeders aren't trying to figure out a way  to, uh, to, to pin up beef cows and efficiently have calves.  
**[1:22:57-1:23:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:22:57):**  And once they do that, we're done.  Yep.  Yep.  
**[1:23:02-1:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:02):**  The organization of the beef industry will be complete and you and I just might as well  go to town and get jobs.  Well, it's just, it's going to be just as quick as, as, as if we don't get some type  
**[1:23:15-1:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:15):**  of legislation like this cattle price discovery and transparency act.  If we don't get something like that done to limit, what is this integration that's been  going?  
**[1:23:26-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:26):**  Every cattle feeder will just be a contract grower, which they basically are now with  the, with the sweetheart deals and everything like that.  85% of them are now.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:36):**  Yeah, exactly.  And, but we're, we're, we're continuously losing our independent cattle feeders, our  independent backgrounders, our independent cow calf guys, because it's gotten so consolidated.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:50):**  And if we don't get something done, it's going to, it's just look at the hog industry.  Yeah.  I was going to ask you about that.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:23:58):**  When I came to Missouri and I, and, and, and in 2000, I became the supervisor of the federal  state market news program.  We still had viable feeder pig sales in Southern Missouri.  
**[1:24:13-1:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:24:13):**  You had a lot of guys that, that, uh, that farrowed out, uh, pigs for living.  That's what they did.  And they were very proud of their, of their pigs.  
**[1:24:23-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:24:23):**  And we had sales down there where they were getting 10,000 head of feeder pigs.  And uh, and you had a lot of, of, of growers, you know, they're not necessarily backgrounders,  but growers of pigs and they would take, they would buy those pigs and grow and then sell  
**[1:24:39-1:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:24:39):**  them on the, on the cash, uh, slaughter hog market.  But in 1998, when they took the, uh, the hog market to 8 cents a pound, it pretty much  eliminated all your independent all feeders.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:24:54):**  The only guys that were left were contract growers.  And uh, and so, and on that, and like I said, there was still a few feeder pig auctions  left.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:25:03):**  And if you think those guys that had a pot load of pigs, weren't as proud of them as  your rancher, that's got a pot load of 500 pound black Baldy steers.  You're wrong.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:25:16):**  They're as proud of those pigs as anybody would be.  And uh, you know, and they, we still had a feeder pig auction at St. Joe stockyards and  that, and I reported the market there and you know, some of those old hog guys would  
**[1:25:28-1:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:25:28):**  tell me, they said, Oh, you remember back in, you know, 1980 so-and-so, you know, remember  how easy it was to sell pigs, you know, when corn got cheap and uh, and you know, one of  the guys said, yeah, I made a phone call and got the wrong number one time, still sold  
**[1:25:44-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:25:44):**  a couple of load of feeder pigs, you know, it was just that easy.  But uh, but when they eliminated your cash market for, for slaughter hogs, it, it, it,  it rubbed out your feeder pigs.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:26:00):**  I want, it sounds like you saw that happen in the late nineties, the mid late nineties,  you saw the pig market collapse.  How did that happen?  
**[1:26:10-1:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:26:10):**  It just, there was nobody to grow those pigs anymore.  They uh, they, your, your, your, uh, your pork processors come in with rules and they  said that you had to be a level three producer to feed hogs for them if they were going to  
**[1:26:27-1:26:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:26:27):**  buy your hogs.  And that meant that you couldn't feed them on dirt anymore.  You had to have a facility where you fed them on concrete or on slats.  
**[1:26:38-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:26:38):**  And uh, and they wanted all the pigs to look the same.  And so all your pigs had to be white and they had to be half brothers and sisters, and then  they had to weigh within ounces of each other because they wanted everything so uniform.  
**[1:26:52-1:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:26:52):**  It kind of reminds you of the way that they're doing the cattle market right now.  It's exactly, they want all your cattle to be black, whether or not they're Angus, they  don't really give a shit.  
**[1:27:04-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:27:04):**  As long as they're black, if they're 51% black and they grade good enough, they still be  CAB so they don't have to be Angus, but they want them all to look alike.  They want you to treat them the same way and they want to dictate to you how you feed them.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:27:20):**  That's what they did in the hog business right before they pulled the rug out.  And you know, and they decided they didn't want to have to post a cash price anymore.  We no longer had the Omaha hog market because you couldn't scrape enough hogs together in  
**[1:27:36-1:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:27:36):**  Omaha to make one truckload of hogs.  So we quit reporting that at USDA because it wasn't a viable market.  Well, everybody sold their hogs off the Omaha hog market.  
**[1:27:47-1:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:27:47):**  And then we went to country buying points and that worked for a while till your buying  stations weren't getting enough hogs to establish a price there.  So they didn't really want to have to post a cash price anymore.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:28:02):**  Well, if they owned all the hogs that were being fed and they own the packing houses,  why the hell should they have to come out with a price to post?  And we're starting to see that with our fat cattle and our feedlots.  
**[1:28:16-1:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:28:16):**  They really don't want to have to come up with a price.  And if they do, they want it to be so infiltrated within some kind of a formula where we can't  report it because of confidentiality reasons and we can't really post it anywhere and nobody  
**[1:28:32-1:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:28:32):**  really knows what the market is.  Is the confidentiality really the root of it?  Like if we had an open contract library and everybody knew what the prices were, would  
**[1:28:42-1:28:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:28:42):**  that help?  It would.  But part of my problem is I am a realist, which is why I support Cattle Price Discovery  
**[1:28:55-1:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:28:55):**  and Transparency Act.  That's why I understand why we can't have 50-14.  If you're in Colorado, you basically got one buyer, maybe two.  
**[1:29:07-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:29:07):**  Once in a while, we'll get a third regional backer coming down in there to buy some cattle  from Nebraska or somewhere.  But you basically have one buyer.  
**[1:29:16-1:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:29:16):**  You don't have that many feedlots and they're basically owned by one entity.  Well, if you report everything that you get in, it's basically making JVS and Five Rivers  pull their pants down and spread their cheeks.  
**[1:29:34-1:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:29:34):**  And I don't know that that's fair for anybody.  So it maintains confidentiality for your packers and your producers and I'm considering a big  corporate feeder of a producer too.  
**[1:29:50-1:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:29:50):**  So nobody should have to tell that.  But included in Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act is the law making your cattle  contract library be enforced.  
**[1:30:07-1:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:30:07):**  So that information would be very valuable to an independent feeder or somebody that's  shopping around looking for an AMA or something like that.  But they won't have to tell who their deal is with and then they won't have to give every  
**[1:30:24-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:30:24):**  specific about it, but it would at least give an idea of how this is how they're doing it.  And I live right amongst them.  I mean, they live right down the road from me and across the road.  
**[1:30:37-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:30:37):**  These guys that work for these big corporate feeders and they will tell me privately, I  hope you guys get something done on that because they know that if we're negotiating their  base price at a higher level that that base price is going to be better.  
**[1:30:56-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:30:56):**  And so they can't say it out loud because the packers cracked their whip on them.  So you can't say it out loud, but they will.  And then I talked to other guys that are in these sweetheart deals and they'll say, you  
**[1:31:14-1:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:31:14):**  guys can force us to negotiate as many percentage calories you want, but I'm not showing you  my sweetheart deal.  My sweetheart deal includes everything up to and including big 12 football scores.  
**[1:31:26-1:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:31:26):**  And I'm not going to let you get rid of my sweetheart deal because I know what kind of  cattle I feed.  I know how I feed them and I've crafted my sweetheart deal to fit those cattle.  
**[1:31:40-1:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:31:40):**  And there may not be what everybody else has to do to get a premium, but it's got enough  volume and only true premium in your cattle feeding is volume.  And then once you sign up into an AMA that eliminates competition.  
**[1:31:57-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:31:57):**  Well, if you've got supply and no competition, you pretty much make the market anything you  want it to be.  Yep.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:32:07):**  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  So one of the last things I want to talk to you about is imports.  
**[1:32:17-1:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:32:17):**  I've heard the gentleman with cattle facts stand up in front of a room of people and  this was after the Tyson fire, but before COVID.  So that was back when the Packers were only making like 400, 450 bucks a carcass.  
**[1:32:38-1:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:32:38):**  I don't know how they got there.  And I sat there and I listened to the cattle facts guy go through the import numbers, go  through the export numbers.  
**[1:32:49-1:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:32:49):**  And he changed units in between like one of them, he was using pounds and the other one  was like million tons or something, but he kept changing up his units.  So you weren't looking at it.  
**[1:33:01-1:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:33:01):**  So he wasn't showing the numbers, apples, the apples.  So I sat there on my pad and I scribbled down the numbers and I did the conversions.  I was like, okay, we're exporting more than we're exporting.  
**[1:33:17-1:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:33:17):**  So tell me why all these imports are a good thing for the American cattlemen.  And the guy with cattle facts got pretty upset.  He didn't have an answer.  
**[1:33:28-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:33:28):**  Do you have an answer as to how we're importing more than we're exporting?  Why is that supposed to be a good thing for the cattlemen?  Well, I don't think it's a good thing for the cattlemen, but the answer to why we do  
**[1:33:43-1:34:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:33:43):**  that is we are beef lovers here in the United States and we sop up about 80% of our production  right here in the United States.  The reason why those imports and exports are important is, and you will hear this and you  
**[1:34:06-1:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:34:06):**  don't like to hear it, but it's our relationships with our trading partners.  We make a shitload of grain and a lot of times we need to get rid of that.  So we rely on a lot of these countries, especially these countries like China that don't have  
**[1:34:29-1:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:34:29):**  free market systems.  And the production in China is pitiful.  Why is that?  
**[1:34:38-1:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:34:38):**  Because everybody makes the same.  Why are you going to get up at five in the morning and work your ass off when you're  going to make the same as the laziest farmer?  
**[1:34:49-1:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:34:49):**  Because that's just the way it is.  You don't get paid on your production.  You get paid the same.  
**[1:34:58-1:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:34:58):**  Everybody gets paid the same.  So in essence, you don't have a lot of production out of those areas.  Well, if we're going to sell them this much grain, then we have to buy so many of their  
**[1:35:09-1:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:35:09):**  widgets and we may even have to buy a little bit of beef off of them.  But one thing that I've always believed and I know it to be true, and I got chastised  for putting it into a government market report for once, but the US beef industry relies  
**[1:35:30-1:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:35:30):**  on Asia mostly to shop from the top of our shelves and Mexico to shop from the bottom.  So every carcass has stuff that we don't like.  And so we've got to get rid of that.  
**[1:35:50-1:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:35:50):**  So if we're going to sell tripe, livers and ox tails and things like that, that we don't  typically eat, we may have to buy a little bit of their product that we can grind up.  Now bringing that product in, which is heavily brought in from Brazil, now that two of our  
**[1:36:14-1:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:36:14):**  big four are owned by Brazil.  That can't be a coincidence.  That's not a coincidence.  
**[1:36:19-1:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:36:19):**  Yeah, it's not a coincidence.  But they slaughter a lot of brushy type cattle.  Now I'm not saying grass fed with wholesome forages and things like that.  
**[1:36:34-1:36:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:36:34):**  I'm talking about just brushy ass cattle that are their maturity is too high for our grading  system.  And they're just three or four or five year old, just things that's been out there, eating  
**[1:36:49-1:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:36:49):**  whatever.  Well, that's not real palatable.  But it makes for some cheap beef.  
**[1:36:57-1:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:36:57):**  Well, they can bring that crap over here and then we feed most all of our cattle.  So that makes them have way too much bark or fat around the outside of the carcass,  which doesn't help their grading and hurts it makes them more your grade fours and fives,  
**[1:37:13-1:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:37:13):**  and not necessarily choice and primes.  So we can trim that fat off, throw it in a hopper with some of that crap that we get  from South Africa or South America and grind it up.  
**[1:37:27-1:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:37:27):**  And it makes that brushy crap tastes pretty good.  And that's that's, that's that comes from our cows and the trimmings off of our steers  and heifers.  
**[1:37:38-1:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:37:38):**  But them putting product of USA on that is not fair.  Yes.  And it should be against the law.  
**[1:37:47-1:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:37:47):**  And and and a lot of people in the industry cuss me because I do not support mandatory  country of origin labeling, but I do support truth and label.  So how would you want country of origin labeling to work?  
**[1:38:07-1:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:38:07):**  Do you think that should be you think it should be a voluntary thing without a government  mandate?  No, I think we should have truth and labeling where if that if if there's a chance any of  
**[1:38:18-1:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:38:18):**  that product came from another country, it should have to say but 100% 100% 100% 100%  100%.  But mandatory country of origin labeling, as many groups are fighting for in the way  
**[1:38:32-1:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:38:32):**  we had it before, meant that every label should have a listing of any country that that could  possibly come from.  Which, you know, good information, but most housewives didn't pay any attention to it.  
**[1:38:48-1:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:38:48):**  They had a budget and they were buying what they bought.  The problem with having to list all that stuff out, like Emcool calls for is you've got packing  plants in Canada, you know, our office in South St. Paul was right next to one.  
**[1:39:05-1:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:39:05):**  There was a plant in northern Minnesota that killed a lot of Canadian cows.  I saw Canadian trucks from back up there every morning when I got to the office to unload  Canadian cows.  
**[1:39:18-1:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:39:18):**  Well, with Emcool, they got to shut that plant down, sterilize the entire plant, get every  speck of meat out of every saw, then they could start processing some some cattle that  came from another country.  
**[1:39:34-1:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:39:34):**  Okay, as soon as they got done processing those, shut the plant down again, sterilize  everything there, get every speck of meat out of every single blade out of every corner  of every stainless steel table before they could go back.  
**[1:39:50-1:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:39:50):**  And when you're in cattle production, you want smoke going out of all those stacks in  the pack of plants at all times.  So having to specify that.  
**[1:40:02-1:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:40:02):**  All I really want to know is, is it completely a product of the USA or is it not?  That's all I really give a shit about.  Just tell me whether it is or it ain't.  
**[1:40:14-1:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:40:14):**  And then I can make my purchasing decisions based on that.  I don't need you to shut those plants down.  And I'm talking about further processing too, which also includes that.  
**[1:40:28-1:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:40:28):**  But that's why I'm for truth and labeling, not necessarily for Emcool.  I can agree with that.  We need some truth in labeling.  
**[1:40:39-1:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:40:39):**  And anything, but the flip side of that is anything that government comes down and we  give the government the power to mandate and regulate, that's a power that they'll always  have because there's no power that the government has ever given up or roll back or said, you  
**[1:40:58-1:41:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:40:58):**  know, maybe we shouldn't be involved in this anymore.  So we're just going to quit doing it.  Once the government kind of gets involved in something, their involvement kind of always  
**[1:41:07-1:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:41:07):**  tends to increase over time.  I agree with that to a level, but a lot of people are using that as an argument to fight  against this Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act.  
**[1:41:19-1:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:41:19):**  But everything in the beef processing and cattle feeding is monitored by the government.  If you've got so many head on feed and you don't have containment of your manure and  you're going to have to have a lagoon or you're going to have to follow rules by that.  
**[1:41:40-1:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:41:40):**  You can only put so much weight on those trucks when you're sending those trucks in somewhere.  You've got to have an inspection whenever you slaughter those animals.  Who else can oversee our trading of fed cattle and make sure that it's on a level playing  
**[1:41:59-1:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:41:59):**  field or that we get a proper amount of negotiated trade to exploit that price with AMAs after  we've established that price?  Who else can oversee it?  
**[1:42:13-1:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:42:13):**  That's all there is, is the government.  Anybody else is going to get paid off at the very beginning and there's nobody else that  has the authority to do that.  
**[1:42:28-1:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:42:28):**  So we have to have them come in there and I will agree if they would have enforced those  P&S regulations that we had for 100 years, if they would have enforced them through the  60s and 70s and 80s, we wouldn't be in the shape that we're in right now, but we are.  
**[1:42:48-1:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:42:48):**  So we have to do that.  Even though they're working that special investigator bill through Congress right now or trying  to, it's going to be hard for them to go in there and say, packers can't own cattle anymore.  
**[1:43:08-1:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:43:08):**  Well, they do own them.  They have control of them through these marketing agreements.  Now that's one thing the introduction of Brazilian packers changed is they didn't outright  
**[1:43:22-1:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:43:22):**  own them anymore.  We used to have Caprock cattle feeders.  Well that was Cargill's Cattle Feeding Enterprise.  
**[1:43:29-1:43:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:43:29):**  We had Five Rivers which was JVS or Swift's Cattle Feeding Enterprise.  Everybody had JVS come in there and they could not manage the logistics of running a feed  lot because they didn't know how to get the cattle bought because they weren't used to  
**[1:43:48-1:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:43:48):**  of having to negotiate for those feeder cattle either.  They'd just go make a contract with a big ranch and they'd send those cattle in until  they rent out and then they'd go do another one.  
**[1:43:59-1:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:43:59):**  They didn't know how to go to all these pesky competitive negotiated auction markets and  buy these feeder cattle.  They didn't know how to do it.  
**[1:44:08-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:44:08):**  You know, people were sending them balling calves and they wondered why they were getting  sick when they got to the feed lot.  So they decided that they no longer wanted to own Five Rivers Cattle Feeding Enterprise  
**[1:44:18-1:44:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:44:18):**  and so they sold it but made it where they got all the cattle that come out of them.  You know, and all your other big packers and the ones that lived here or were native to  the United States they said, hey these these Brazilians aren't as dumb as they look.  
**[1:44:37-1:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:44:37):**  You know, we don't want to feed the cattle either.  We just want them.  We just want control of them.  
**[1:44:43-1:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:44:43):**  And so you saw Caprock disperse their, you know, Cargill doesn't own their cattle anymore.  They dispersed them all to other big corporate feeders and stuff.  They just want control of the cattle.  
**[1:44:56-1:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:44:56):**  They don't want to have to feed them themselves.  Because there's risk in there.  Sure.  
**[1:45:02-1:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:02):**  They're just trying to insulate themselves from all the risk and they haven't figured  out how to de-risk the cow calf business enough to suit him yet, which is why we haven't been  chicken-ized or we haven't been pork-ified.  
**[1:45:17-1:45:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:17):**  Exactly.  But we are, if you stand back and where you can see the forest from the trees, we are  slowly being done that way.  
**[1:45:28-1:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:28):**  But they don't want any liability when it comes as far as health and safety and they  don't want any risk.  And I noticed that when I was back East working in Pennsylvania, when Smithville come in and  
**[1:45:41-1:45:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:41):**  bought the major packing plant out there, they immediately, they're like, why do we  have to compete for these fat cattle?  We're in the hog business.  
**[1:45:52-1:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:52):**  We just make contracts with everybody.  Everybody's a contract grower.  Nobody knows what the market is.  
**[1:45:58-1:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:45:58):**  We're making lots of money.  We want to do that on the cattle end too.  They started going to those small independent feeders back East in Pennsylvania, and they  
**[1:46:08-1:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:46:08):**  wanted to get them all under contract.  And then they even went to the men and night Amish people that had that grew cattle and  they wanted to get them under contract.  
**[1:46:20-1:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:46:20):**  They wanted to contract all their calves at Weenie several years out.  Well, how would you know what your inputs are at that point to whether you could be  profitable or not?  
**[1:46:31-1:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:46:31):**  But they immediately wanted to turn the cattle industry into the hog business.  And that's slowly what's happening all over the country.  So how do we stop it?  
**[1:46:43-1:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:46:43):**  We've got to preserve what little negotiated trade we have.  If we ever allow them to completely get rid of the negotiated trade, it's over.  And the only way we can do that is put mandates on it.  
**[1:46:57-1:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:46:57):**  Yep.  We've got our biggest cattle associations fighting it because of their fear of the packer.  You know, I know they recently passed, but he was a huge cattle feeder and a close personal  
**[1:47:13-1:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:47:13):**  friend of mine.  I shouldn't say close, but he was a personal friend of mine and he had thoughts.  And then there was rumors of him building his own packing plant or him and his family  
**[1:47:25-1:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:47:25):**  building a packing plant.  And they had went so far to finding a place to put it, finding a labor pool to get it  going and all this kind of stuff.  
**[1:47:38-1:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:47:38):**  And then it kind of stalled out.  And I talked to him one day and I said, I thought you were going to build your own packing  plant.  
**[1:47:47-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:47:47):**  He said, I was.  And he said, I looked at it and I looked at the feasibility of it and it would have worked.  And I said, so what the hell?  
**[1:47:55-1:48:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:47:55):**  And he said, well, the bad thing about building my own pack and plant is it takes two years  to build it.  He said, you know what they could do to me in two years.  
**[1:48:06-1:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:48:06):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably put him completely out of business.  
**[1:48:13-1:48:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:48:13):**  Absolutely.  He'd be out of business for you if it got opened up.  And I fear that for these new plants that are coming in and using some of that Biden  
**[1:48:23-1:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:48:23):**  money to come in.  I desperately need regional packers.  And the one that's coming in North Platte and some of the others, gosh, I hope and pray  
**[1:48:34-1:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:48:34):**  that they're able to work.  But you think that these big four packers play dirty pool in purchasing of the cattle.  You wait till they find out how dirty pool they can play on the other end on selling  
**[1:48:47-1:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:48:47):**  the meat.  They don't need to invest any of the record profits they've made in the last two and a  half years to build new plants because somebody is going to build them a brand new one in  
**[1:49:00-1:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:00):**  North Platte, Nebraska.  They'll buy for pennies on the dollar.  Ten cents on the taxpayer subsidized dollar within 10 years.  
**[1:49:09-1:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:09):**  Yeah.  Al Capone didn't start out in the packing district in Chicago by accident.  I haven't heard this.  
**[1:49:19-1:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:19):**  Those mobsters and thugs started out in the packing districts and they're still there.  It's the same strong arm tactics that they used back in the 20s and 30s.  It's just at a different level.  
**[1:49:35-1:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:35):**  It's faster and use intimidation and backlash and strong arm tactics fooling yourself.  It's faster and scarier now because cell phones and text messages.  Yes.  
**[1:49:47-1:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:47):**  Absolutely.  All right.  Corbett, it has been awesome hanging out with you today.  
**[1:49:54-1:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:49:54):**  Okay.  I don't want to take up too much more of your time.  Well, Brian, I'm just going to tell you right now, I have no plans of committing suicide  
**[1:50:02-1:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:50:02):**  and if they find me dead in my cell, it wasn't because I hung myself with a bed sheet.  Okay.  I will make sure that that gets in the show.  
**[1:50:12-1:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:50:12):**  I will not edit that out.  I just want to make that clear.  All right.  
**[1:50:21-1:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:50:21):**  So where can people find you if you don't get Clintonized?  Okay.  Well, you can find me on my daily cattle market report, which at one point it was a three  
**[1:50:36-1:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:50:36):**  minute update, which we went way beyond that, but it's usually from 10 to 15 minutes, usually  around 12 minutes and it's called the feeder flash.  You can find me on Facebook, on Twitter.  
**[1:50:52-1:51:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:50:52):**  My favorite place for people to go to find that report is that website called national  beef wire.  And that includes my report and a lot of other market information that we draw with DV auctions,  
**[1:51:08-1:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:51:08):**  power and connections and technology.  And it's got a lot of information on there at national beef wire.com and you can go on  there.  
**[1:51:18-1:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/67-Corbitt-Wall-Not-Enough-Gravy-e1je9uu#t=1:51:18):**  You can have the feeder flash in your inbox every morning, as soon as it gets posted and  you can, you can do it that way.  But that's the best way to get a hold of my information.

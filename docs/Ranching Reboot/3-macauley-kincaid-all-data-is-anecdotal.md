We have Matt Kincaid with Kincaid Farms who also won Young Regenerative Farmer of the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:00:43):**  Year.  So congratulations, Matt.  We're so happy to have you on.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:00:46):**  Thanks for having me.  So Matt, you've got some other news from your personal life.  And you know, I understand it'll be three weeks or more before we air this.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:00:57):**  Is there something else that happened last week you want to share?  Yeah, just had another kid.  That's been fun.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:06):**  No sleep and running off practically zero.  But hey, I'm still functioning, you know, just barely though.  Congratulations.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:14):**  Congratulations.  Thanks, guys.  So start off, tell us your story.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:21):**  Tell us your history.  Tell us your education and tell us about you.  Okay.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:25):**  So I breezed through high school and decided I didn't want to go anywhere after that.  So I kind of got started farming.  After my dad passed away, he passed away from cancer and I inherited 60 acres.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:39):**  So I kind of got a boost at the beginning.  But currently my farm is around 650 acres of row crop.  And I run around 80 cow calf pairs a year kind of give or take, you know, if I have  
**[0:01:50-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:01:50):**  to cull some things off or something.  And I also run a lot of I do a lot of custom grazing.  So that adds about another 50 or 60 animals per year on the farm.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:00):**  And a lot of custom grazing is mostly on just like annuals, like warm season annuals or  cool season annuals and cover crops.  And so it's a great way to have pretty good cash flow.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:09):**  But yeah, I mean, really, I mean, that's just kind of how I got started.  Dad passed away and here's makers and I just took some risks where I thought I could make  them, you know, justify them.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:19):**  And I've done that, I guess.  I mean, you know, the farm payments, they don't ever stop, you know, so year in and  year out, you know, it's kind of a big chunk of money.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:28):**  But I'm proud to say last year, my wife and I paid off our first farm.  And we just got a couple more to knock out.  That's huge.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:37):**  So really, we're trying to tell stories about how to get started.  So how did you acquire some of these initial resources and, you know, land and cattle and  capital to go from what you had to where you are?  
**[0:02:53-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:02:53):**  Okay, so I'm working a full time job on my farm side.  You know, I kind of, you know, I ran a full time job, my uncle, my grandfather, they're  pretty large farmers.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:04):**  So from the time I was 14, you know, I was on a tractor.  I mean, I was driving a truck or whatever, you know, whatever they wanted me to do when  I was 14 on and my grandpa come knock on my window, wake me up.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:14):**  My mom and dad only lived about a mile away from my grandparents.  So I said I worked full time for them.  And their farm is very conventional.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:24):**  You know, it's a lot of tillage and, and, you know, a lot of chemical use and they have  cattle too, but they treat their cattle, they feed their cattle instead of their cattle  feeding them.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:34):**  You know, they're always they start feeding hay in October and stop maybe in like, beginning  May.  So we're in Southwest Missouri.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:41):**  You know, we got a long growing season.  So that you know, that's, that's not how I do my operation.  How I got the capital?  
**[0:03:47-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:03:47):**  Well, I guess, you know, long story short, you know, I did I did inherit my dad, he wasn't  a farmer, he's a truck driver.  So he had a 2008 Challenger, which, you know, was a pretty nice car.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:03):**  And I didn't need it.  So I sold that.  And really, that little bit of money, I think it was like 20,000.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:09):**  That's kind of what got me started.  I started off with zero equipment, you know, zero cattle.  All I had was 60 acres.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:16):**  And just a dream.  I just kept rolling with it.  It was a lot of it was a lot of thought process.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:21):**  I don't feel like I'm probably necessarily the best worker in the world.  Like when it comes to like labor, you know, I'm like, oh, this sucks.  But you know, I just keep my nose down and just keep going.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:30):**  I would rather out think my problems and physically work my problems.  So you know, a lot of things are not harder.  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:38):**  Smart, not hard.  That's why I use that a lot, actually.  I just look for ways to save money.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:44):**  I mean, let's take my cattle for example.  Okay, I didn't own a tractor and a loader.  So that's why I started bale graving.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:51):**  Okay.  So I got a neighbor who had a tractor and baler and he charged me $1 per bale to set  them out.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:04:59):**  So like last year, I said 80 bales of hay.  That's all I said, which this year will be less than that.  But I was pretty happy that I call it last year.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:04):**  So it cost me 80 bucks per bale to feed the hay and then the hay was about 30 bucks a  bale.  And it wasn't really great quality hay, but it was good enough for my cows, you know.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:14):**  So yeah, really just, you know, finding ways to save on expenses on my cattle herds.  I've never warmed a cow or even vaccinated a calf or nothing.  I just, I don't, you know, do black leg shots.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:27):**  I've never lost any because of that.  Most times I lose the calf.  It was from something like, I couldn't control I feel like, you know, whether it was, oh,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:35):**  the calf come backwards or heifer had problem or whatever might be the case.  I just, I just started to keep my expenses low.  You can't control how much you're going to make.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:42):**  You can only control how much you're going to spend.  And I really take that to heart.  You got to make your farm work economically if you're going to try to make it work, you  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:49):**  know.  I like that.  That was a great quote.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:52):**  You can't control how much you make, but you can control how much you spend.  Write that down.  Let's talk a little bit more about bale grazing.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:05:59):**  So why do you bale graze and on what type of land are you doing bale grazing?  Okay, so the bale grazing always takes place on perennial pastures.  And so there's some really good pointers to this.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:14):**  Number one, your time is worth something.  So let's say hypothetically, have your tractor paid off and you go and feed a bale of hay  every year.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:21):**  Well, you're always putting that money back aside to buy the next tractor, the next hay  bale or the next whatever if you put up hay.  I buy all my hay.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:28):**  I don't have all that extra equipment expense because to me it doesn't justify on the size  of my farm to buy hay equipment.  It just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:36):**  So when I said it takes about 15 seconds a day to feed a bale of hay, I'm not exaggerating.  Literally, I just take the poly wire, I go up to bale of hay, I lift it over each bale  each day.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:47):**  So, you know, I mean, all my buddies come out there like, hey, you want to help me feed  hay?  And like, oh, yeah, sure.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:06:52):**  So they think we're getting to pick up and go feed a bale of hay.  We'll walk out my pasture on foot, grab the poly wire in the post, lift it up over the  bale, my cows got a bale for the day.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:01):**  It's really that simple.  You know, I mean, it's not too technical or whatever.  It's always fun when somebody challenges you at the coffee shop or the restaurant co-op.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:13):**  I don't know how you do that.  I don't have time to move my cows every day.  And just, you know, how do you explain to them that it takes a couple of minutes?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:24):**  Well, I mean, so yeah, your original setup on bale grazing, if we're talking about that,  it doesn't take long.  It's just one poly wire for me because I have a back fence and water's on the backside of  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:35):**  fence.  So literally, like I said, I'm just lifting up one post over each bale a day.  I've got the real slack.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:40):**  So the real move on its own is I'm lifting up over and during the growing season.  So my road, I kind of, I really do what Alan Williams talks about, adapting multi-paddock  grazing.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:07:53):**  That's really my grazing style.  I mean, you know, I'm fluctuating stock density.  I'm fluctuating the amount of moves I make a day, my rotation, what time of year it is.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:08:03):**  If it's really wet out, I might give them a wider area so they don't pug it up as bad.  I'm literally being adaptive.  I'm changing every single day.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:08:11):**  So like for example, today when I go move the cows this evening, they're on some milo  stock and I would call it more like a strip grazing.  The, you know, the grazing paddock is small.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:08:22):**  It's narrow, but it's long because it's in a row crop field, of course.  And it takes the entire reel actually to make it all the way across.  I broke a few.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:08:31):**  I've had to add some polywire to all my reels to get them to reach out that far.  But you know, I mean, just, you know, for my system, it works really well for me.  Now I would never tell anybody just to, let's say if you're getting started, you know, it's  
**[0:08:46-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:08:46):**  so easy with cattle, especially on rented ground.  So I kind of did it backwards of how you probably should do it.  If I was going to press the restart button, I would probably go look for rented land.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:00):**  Rent some land because the cost of land is so expensive, it's hard to justify.  So you know, rent some land, buy a couple poly reels.  Even if the farm only has one water source, just, you know, backtrack to the water.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:15):**  They don't want to go back for water when they need it, but just keep them moving.  Keep the cattle moving.  You know, I'm sure Brian's talking about that.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:20):**  You know, if you leave cattle in one area, or you let them, if you do Columbus method  grazing, they're going to just tear up your farm.  You're going to have these cow pass down your pasture, it's going to cause erosion, especially  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:31):**  in our high rainfall environment.  I mean, if I did that, it'd be a complete disaster, you know?  Right.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:38):**  So before we get a whole lot further, tell us about, tell us where you are and what your  climate's like and kind of what your forage base, what your management context is a little  bit more, you did, you know, you did touch on it that you've got some row crops and couch  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:09:55):**  half pairs.  So tell us about like your environment and an ecosystem rainfall forage base, things  like that.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, so we're supposed to be about a 44 inch rainfall environment.  Our first freeze on average is October 22nd.  So we're relatively pretty, you know, most of the year.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:10:17):**  You know, mostly in our pastures, I mean, in my area especially, it's mostly just fescue.  And fescue to me is the absolute easiest grass to manage.  I mean, it's, you know, you can look up Jim Garish or Greg Judy or whoever on managing  
**[0:10:32-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:10:32):**  fescue pasture, and there's so many different methods that work.  I think it's so much more easy in my environment than it is in like your environment, because  of how dry you guys are.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:10:43):**  You know, with me, I can make mistakes, and in 45 days, if we get it rained, it's going  to recover back and I'm going to be all right.  But you know, I feel like I have, yeah, yeah, wrong time a year.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:10:58):**  It could take two years or longer to recover that.  Exactly.  And with me, like I said, with how much rainfall we get the heat units we get stuff just grows,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:11:08):**  you know, I mean, it's not hard to it's not hard to but now that does have some disadvantages  too.  So like last year, for example, before June 1, we had 45 inches of rain before June 1.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:11:21):**  So that makes it really difficult with row cropping because you know, there's kind of  timely times you need to get stuff planted.  That's why to me, cattle are a great way to step into farming because you don't have all  
**[0:11:33-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:11:33):**  the equipment costs.  You know, you don't have I mean, people totally get messed up on equipment costs.  There is so much money and I mean, property taxes, insurance and fuel and just regular  
**[0:11:46-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:11:46):**  upkeep on equipment maintenance is terrible.  You know, I mean, and it's just, I think cattle are a great way to get started, especially  with rented land, you know.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:11:56):**  I think that's really good advice.  So let's talk about your crop operation.  You do cover crops too, right?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:02):**  And you graze those cover crops?  All the fields I own but one have a fence on and water.  Yep.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:10):**  So what's your strategy for grazing cover crops as far as planting and things like that?  Okay, so when bean price is really crappy, I don't know why guys are planting double  crop beans in my environment.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:22):**  I was planting warm season cover crop mixes and grazing them out.  I mean, I could graze you know, I mean, for example, a couple years ago, I was grazing  74 cow calf pairs.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:33):**  And you know, I make a dollar a day.  So even though they had like 200 pound cows on them, I'll get a dollar just as I was for  their mom.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:41):**  And there was bulls in there too.  So I was getting $2 a day for them.  So you know, when you're getting $76 a day, it's pretty easy work and pretty steady income.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:52):**  And I don't have a whole lot of expense in it.  I mean, yeah, I do have the poly wire and I do have the fencing infrastructure and things  like that.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:12:59):**  But for the most part, you know, I'm, I guess of how I'm grazing them.  It's kind of the same way.  It's really wet outside.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:06):**  You get a bigger area.  If it's dry, like most times it kind of is in summer.  You know, they're gonna be more, they're gonna be tighter.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:12):**  They're gonna run like, you know, around 40,000 stock density somewhere in there probably,  you know, just on average.  I mean, we're, I don't have them super tight.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:19):**  I'm not running like a million pound on my crop land just because my system isn't that  far along, you know.  And I don't want to, I don't really want to cause issues in my ground.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:33):**  I mean, if you jump in this too fast, you're gonna pug your ground up and you might cause  more damage than you're doing good at first, you know.  You're just kind of trying to get it started going, you know.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:45):**  Right.  Right.  So what kind of, what are some of your cover crop loons that you like?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:52):**  What works well?  Well, they vary.  Yeah, they vary a lot depending on the resource.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:13:55):**  So I plant everything from facility to sedan grass to safflower.  I mean, I don't know how many different species I've raised, probably just guessing 30 or  40, not at one time, of course, but you know, for like a summer mix like that, since most  
**[0:14:11-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:11):**  of the time I'll go like wheat and then a cover crop mix to go to corn.  So with it, there'll be a few cool season components.  Like there'll be some radishes in there, maybe some batch or something like that.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:23):**  But the majority of those mixes will be sedan grass, sun hints, sunflowers, bus wheat, you  know, safflower, balding, especially from green cover seed.  I really like that one.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:33):**  There's a plug for them because it's a spineless, it's a spineless, it's a spineless safflower.  So the cattle, you know, work their mouths to eat.  And it works out pretty good.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:45):**  I mean, you can have a lot of, there's a lot of different species that work, especially  down here.  I feel like really there's not very many species I can think of that don't work.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:53):**  There's quite a bit that do work, you know.  Right.  You obviously ended up where you're at.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:14:59):**  You're in Southwest Missouri because that's where you're from.  So here's a question.  If you could pick up and go anywhere, where would you go and why?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:15:12):**  Okay.  Probably, I think probably Arkansas.  You know, they seem to be, especially to get in like the wooded areas, which would be a  
**[0:15:25-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:15:25):**  great place, you know, that land might be cheaper.  So you know, somewhere like that, somewhere where, this is kind of probably a bad example,  but you know, Greg Judy found that niche place where the land was affordable and he could  
**[0:15:39-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:15:39):**  make it work and he could justify that ground.  And yeah, he had to do a lot of manual labor, which I don't like doing that because I'm  lazy, but you know, he had to do a lot of manual labor to make it what it is.  
**[0:15:50-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:15:50):**  But somewhere probably like that, you know, somewhere where land is relatively cheap,  you know, and he can grow fescue.  Because if you can grow fescue, fescue is just so stupid simple to manage.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:01):**  I mean, I actually hate fescue because there's so many negative effects with it, especially  with the K31 like we got.  But yeah, you know, I want more warm season in my pastures.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:12):**  So that's actually one thing, kind of get off subject a little bit here, but in my pastures,  I'm starting to see big bluestem, you know, switchgrass, little blue, Dallas grass.  I'm starting to see some of these warm seasons.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:26):**  Actually this year, I found my first cardinal flower, which is freaking awesome.  Because as you guys know that the native that's a native prairie.  I don't know what it is.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:34):**  It's not a legume, it's a broadleaf, native prairie broadleaf.  And I've seen the first one this year, it's actually two of them.  And they're about 30 feet away from each other in the shade.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:42):**  It's so awesome and beautiful, bright red bloom.  Just an awesome plant.  You know, I mean, that's, I don't know that stuff like that gives me a jitter still.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:51):**  It's sweet.  It's a huge benchmark, right?  That you're doing the right thing.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:16:58):**  I guess I'm just lucky.  So are those things that you planted or are those in the seed bank in the soil?  I did not plant them.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:08):**  So there's two ways they got there.  You're stirring it up.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:13):**  They either come from the late, late seed bank or they come from hay, one to two.  Or the river wash.  You know, no, I didn't plant those.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:22):**  I don't know how much those would cost.  I know Gama grass is pretty expensive, but no, the Dallas grass and the big blue, all  that just kind of showed up.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:31):**  I don't, like I said, I don't know where it comes from.  It must have been the seed bank because I don't remember feeding hay there since I had  the farm, but it could have been one of the previous owners.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:38):**  You know, you never really know.  Interesting.  So is that something you're going to try to manage to increase or are you?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:46):**  Yes.  What's your plan for it?  100%.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:17:49):**  So those areas where the big blue is, I put up a polly wire around those areas.  The cattle graze close to those areas, but not near them.  And I'm trying to let all that go to seed.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:00):**  All of those warm seasons go to seed.  They are not getting grazed.  They'll get dormant graze, but they are not getting grazed in the growing season.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:07):**  Not at all.  Okay.  I found that my big blue stem, I can graze it fairly early in the season.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:14):**  And as long as they still have some moisture reserves remaining in about 45 to 52 days  of growing season left, it'll go ahead and finish out and go to seed.  So it'll be interesting to see what your observations are in another year or two about how your  
**[0:18:33-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:33):**  big blue stem responds to that grazing and that management.  Well, there was some, there have been some birds.  I see some birds on there and like, I always try to, cause some of these, I mean, this  
**[0:18:44-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:44):**  farm I'm talking about like my home farm.  I mean, literally right next to my house is where I'm talking.  So when I see birds out there, the shotgun's going off.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:18:53):**  I mean, I just don't simmer around the big blue patch because I really want to manage  all those things.  Now I know I can't stop that from happening, but hey, it makes me feel better.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:19:07):**  Maybe the birds are just spreading it around.  I know in a similar vein about birds and seed dispersion.  I've seen some research coming out in Nebraska about Eastern red cedar trees in which we  
**[0:19:21-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:19:21):**  don't need to get into talking about cedar tree management today.  That may be a summer series.  The birds that eat the cedar berries, that berry will pass the digestive tract within  
**[0:19:38-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:19:38):**  seven minutes.  And that means that it's only about a 200 to 250 yard radius around that female tree  that bears the seeds that is really subject to infestation.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:19:55):**  So the question would be is, is there maybe a benefit to letting birds eat some of those  seeds and naturally disperse them?  Because when it comes out of the back of the bird, it's perfectly encapsulated in fertilizer.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:11):**  Right, right.  Well, let me reiterate, I'm not advocating to keep birds off your farm.  They're a wonderful part of the ecosystem.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:20):**  I love seeing Cardinals out grazing.  My wife's got a bird feeder behind her house.  I eat that crap up.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:26):**  But my thing is, I'm really weird on some things.  Some things I'm like, okay, I try to manage this side of things.  I'm not with my graze and my cattle, I try to manage that.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:36):**  But other things, I'm just like, I'll just let it go to hell.  I mean, people are like, oh, are you going to brush off your pasture?  You got trees coming up?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:43):**  I'm like, nah, it'll be all right.  You got those blackberries, you're going to spray those?  Nah, they'll be all right.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:48):**  So let's talk about blackberries for just a second.  So in my environment, we've got quail cut.  We still do.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:20:55):**  We've tracked quail on my farm.  And I let blackberries go to seed because that's a winter food source.  Plus it's predator protection.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:04):**  So they can run up underneath the blackberries and be safe from hawks or foxes or whatever.  So there's advantages and disadvantages to everything.  Like Ray Archuleta says, nature, self-feeling, self-organizing, self-regulating.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:20):**  You just got to kind of let stuff be sometimes.  Like I said, I don't really get too worked up about seeing trees or brush in my pasture.  Some guys cringe at that.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:29):**  But why do I want to spend money on that?  Like brush hogging or spraying it.  I have sprayed my pasture in some places, but I try to keep it minimal, minimize the  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:38):**  disturbance.  But I mean, just let it just go.  It doesn't really bother me if that stuff comes on.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:43):**  I think that it's trying to put it there for a reason.  Maybe the soil needs a fungal dominant plant there like a tree or shrub to grow for the  soil side of things.  
**[0:21:51-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:21:51):**  You just don't really ever know.  You just go with the flow on some stuff.  You touched on something about the fungal microbial balance and maybe we'll swing back  
**[0:22:02-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:02):**  in that later.  And I agree with you about there's a certain level that you just kind of have to look,  you know, just say, you know what, whatever, I'm not going to worry about this.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:13):**  Right.  I kind of remember back in the late 80s, my dad had a hired man that he had some pretty  good advice and he said, well, if it bothers you that much, just don't go over there anymore.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:27):**  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't look that way.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:33):**  Yeah.  And, you know, I think everybody's operation, no matter who's farmer ranch you go to, there's  things you aren't proud of.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:42):**  There's always things you wish you would change.  And I think that's just a natural part of the business.  Yeah, 100%.  
**[0:22:49-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:22:49):**  What are some things that inspire you to be your best self?  I think for my kids, I've got a young boy, his name's Jax and Jax and he's six years  old.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:04):**  And dude, he's like my partner in crime.  I mean, everywhere I go, he's glued to my side.  He's not at school, you know, he wants to be with me, you know, he'll be out there with  
**[0:23:13-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:13):**  cows with me and he asked a lot of questions.  And sometimes, you know, some of the questions he asked, I'm like, why didn't think about  it that way, Jax, but this might be the reason why, you know.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:23):**  But I mean, I think that's one of my big drivers and one of my big pushes.  I want to leave something for my kids, you know.  My wife and I, we have some fairly decent sized life insurance policies that something  
**[0:23:35-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:35):**  has happened to me that would be covered.  You know, I guess, you know, my context of why I do what I do, I think it comes derived  for my children.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:46):**  I mean, I just want the very best, but then I think all parents want that from their kids.  You know, they want the very best for their kids.  And so that's kind of why I push.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:23:54):**  I mean, I'm pushing all the time, you know.  You just got to keep nudging forward.  You might feel like you're making slow progress, but then when you look back, you know, I'm  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:01):**  26.  So, yeah, I've got quite a bit of life ahead of me and I hope I can leave something great  for my kids.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:08):**  Kind of one of my hopes, you know.  And I think that's what a lot of us need to keep in mind is not only what are we building  for ourselves, but what are we going to, what kind of legacy are we going to leave behind,  
**[0:24:21-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:21):**  not only for our children, but for the next couple of generations down the line.  So what are some things that inspired you and got you into regenerative agriculture?  So my first couple of years farming, I was doing everything by the book.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:36):**  I was doing everything what the college was telling me.  I was applying exactly as much fertilizer I needed to do, putting on the line when I  needed it.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:43):**  You know, I was using litter instead of synthetic fertilizer.  I was using things on my corn that were called like in-boost and all these, all this different  crap.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:24:52):**  And I'll give an example, my very first cornfield I ever raised, it was on some rin and ground  16 acres.  I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but it was a lot to me at the time.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:01):**  And I put out this corn crop, did everything by the book.  Well, we went without rain for 35 days or 40 days and the corn made 90 bushel.  And I had this like slap in the face moment there.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:15):**  I'm like, okay, number one, I know I need a no till because I can't afford equipment  to do the crap or custom labor to hire out that stuff.  So I was like, let's figure out how to do this.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:28):**  So I started reading stuff and I started watching videos.  I come across a video from Gabe Brown and I first heard them.  I'm like, God, this guy doesn't know anything about farming.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:38):**  He wasn't an idiot.  And I went right past him.  Well, about a month or two later, I was watching a video from Ray Archuleta and Ray mentioned  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:46):**  Gabe Brown.  And I've got a fairly decent memory.  I'm like, huh, that name sounds familiar.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:51):**  So I punched it back in.  I'm like, oh yeah, this guy.  I clicked that video again.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:25:57):**  And for some reason it was like I was running as hard as I could into a brick wall.  I hit this brick wall and somehow I pushed through the brick wall because the brick wall  is just a mind block in my own mind.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:06):**  I could get past thinking that stuff could work.  I pushed through that brick wall and everything just started lining up.  I mean, I was like, okay, my farm is focusing on soil health and soil health only because  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:18):**  I mean, that's literally my, that's my farm.  My farm focused on soil health.  I focus on soil health.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:25):**  That's what I'm always telling myself.  Don't get caught up in products or practices.  I don't believe in micro and hyponutrients.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:32):**  Don't buy that crap.  Well, let me reiterate, you know, if it fits your operation, try it.  Do control areas to see if it actually pays.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:42):**  But I don't think that stuff pays.  And then, you know, just key to the principles.  Don't focus on products and practices.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:26:51):**  You know, I don't get all hyped up about six inch row corn.  It doesn't make a lot of sense down here in my environment because I can plant a cover  crop anytime of the year, month to year and it's going to grow.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:00):**  It'll eventually start growing.  So I don't need six inch corn to intercede into, you know.  I'm kind of going down a wormhole here.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:09):**  But, you know, on the micronutrient side, so I've took a lot of tissue samples of what  most people would call weeds.  You know, I just call them, you know, Forbes or something my cows like to eat.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:19):**  But let's say food.  Exactly.  So, you know, we got like pigweed, for example.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:27):**  Okay.  Pigweeds are really high in boron.  Okay.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:31):**  So, for example, there are 35.8 parts per million boron on average.  So this is a three year study I've done on my own farm.  I just pull tissue samples on the same day every year of weeds that are at my road crop  
**[0:27:42-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:42):**  fields that I don't spray for just to see what they're bringing to my system because  they're there for a reason.  You know, these weeds are showing us what we're doing wrong.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:27:52):**  You know, like if I've got hairy vegetables in my pastures, that's a cobalt deficiency.  My soil needs cobalt and that's why the hairy vetch is there.  Maybe some nitrogen too.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:01):**  Like Johnson grass.  Okay.  Johnson grass has 101 parts per million zinc.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:07):**  Zinc is the nutrient that plants use to ward off disease.  So it's bringing that to my system and all those plants I just named pigweed, you know,  Johnson grass, lambs quarter, you know, whatever it might be, cows will eat them.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:21):**  Even thistles.  I mean, have you looked at iodine and thistles?  The iodine levels in thistles is insane.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:28):**  So you know, my cows last year, I kind of, some guys might kind of cringe at this, but  I didn't feed minerals most of the last year to my cattle.  But when I did that and I kept them in tighter salt density, they were eating those for,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:44):**  I've got pictures of my cows eating thistles and I can send them to my buddies and it's  like, God, he must be starving your cows to death for eating thistles.  But they were needing those and they'll eat all those plants at different times.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:28:58):**  I mean, it's just, it's amazing what cattle can do and it's amazing what they will do.  I don't have a thistle problem on my farm.  I've never prayed for thistles.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:07):**  Now saying that this year I might have to, because it might just overrun my farm, but  I haven't had to.  I've seen honeybees on thistles.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:14):**  I mean, I think, I think there are very attractive blooming plants, but I think pollinators are  attracted to those.  So, you know, if we just don't go out there and just make a stupid human mistake, I mean,  
**[0:29:27-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:27):**  we were in nature, nature balances itself and we as humans make the imbalances.  When we go and spray for something, it causes another problem.  Everything has cascading compounding effects like Dr. Allen Williams always talks about.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:39):**  That's so true because I see that.  Like when I make a mess up of my farm, my farm shows me exactly where I messed up.  Like, okay, it was too wet this time when I grazed this.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:48):**  Look at my plant growth and look at my plant space.  My plant spacing is far apart.  You know, I don't have a very dense stand.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:29:57):**  It's all about, you know, being and observing and then changing.  That's all, that's all my grazing program really is.  Just seeing what I did wrong and just kind of changing and keep going.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:30:08):**  Right.  And I think that's something that's pretty important.  And, you know, I've had some similar experiences with my cattle and custom cattle at high stock  
**[0:30:18-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:30:18):**  densities.  They get a lot more selective and they try a lot more different forbs and different grasses  and they eat significantly different when you bunch them up and start running.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:30:32):**  Oh, oh, here I think the magic number here is probably going to be somewhere around 25  to 30,000 pounds an acre is when you really start putting the gas pedal on the system.  And I understand that's going to be different for everybody.  
**[0:30:47-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:30:47):**  And here's a term that, here's a term that I want to throw out there.  It is contextually appropriate management.  And it's as long as you are managing appropriately for your context, you don't need to defend  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:09):**  your principles.  You don't need to defend your practices.  Right.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:12):**  Yeah.  I'm only a couple hundred miles west of you, but I'm in a vastly different environment.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:18):**  You're in the desert.  I don't know why you want to farm there, man.  I don't farm.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:23):**  I don't know why anybody would either, but.  Do you guys try to raise corn in your environment?  Oh, yeah, there's guys that raise corn straight north of me, 15 miles.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:39):**  I don't know if I'm going to lose all my grain farmer friends quite yet.  So we're moving on.  One thing I do want to say though, is this.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:31:59):**  I don't believe God gave cows four legs to say to hay bunk, keep them moving.  These animals have four legs for a reason.  They're not supposed to stand there eating crap on themselves.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:10):**  They're supposed to be out on the land.  I get so sick when I see these guys that have hundreds of thousands of acres and they feed  hay in one area.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:19):**  It's disgusting.  I mean, you look at that area.  So I don't want to get into it.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:24):**  I mean, crap where you eat and see how healthy you are.  That just seems like a no brainer to me.  That just seems like common sense.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:32):**  Like, okay, we get sick calves with pneumonia every year.  We have to doctor calves with pneumonia.  Why maybe?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:39):**  Yeah, it might be part of when you're calving.  I pushed my calving way back from where it used to be, but just observe.  I mean, something so simple sometimes becomes so stupid.  
**[0:32:51-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:32:51):**  So you talked about, you just mentioned you pushed your calving date.  So let's talk about that.  Why did you push your calving date and what was the thinking behind that?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:33:03):**  To avoid the rain.  I mean, I would have a cow every year have mastitis, at least one.  And you know, a lot of that's from bacteria getting the udder.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:33:13):**  And I think when they're in so much mud, it just makes a lot of sense to me to not calve  when it's so freaking wet.  It's not necessarily that it's really cold.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:33:23):**  Now it does get cold here occasionally.  I mean, we can get down to teens or it's been negative like once in my life I can remember.  But you know, just I pushed that calving date back and that's still, this might sound kind  
**[0:33:35-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:33:35):**  of weird, but my calving date fluctuates as my system fluctuates.  So like last year, for example, I put the bulls in on April 20th.  Well, this past year, they went in on June 29th.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:33:52):**  So that's kind of moving too.  I haven't found the sweet spot there yet.  I'm just going to find that sweet spot and I really want to find it.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:02):**  And you know, guys like, well, hey, if you take away all these amendments to your cattle,  you know, you just won't have calves or they'll die from black like whatever.  I've not personally seen that on my farm and I'm not advocating to cut stuff like that  
**[0:34:16-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:16):**  off, but I've just not seen that.  I mean, I'm calving out over 90% and that's too good.  I want to calve out less because if I get better epigenetics on my farm, I want to have  
**[0:34:28-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:28):**  some calving issues because I'm trying to wean out to the bottom 5 or 10% off every  year.  I want to keep back the best peppers off the oldest cows that do their job on my farm and  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:42):**  just keep that keep that rolling.  Now keep the system rolling.  Right.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:48):**  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So when are you calving?  
**[0:34:53-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:34:53):**  Well, you said you put your bulls out at the end of June.  So that's going to put you calving kind of in the beginning of summer.  Yep.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:03):**  Yeah.  Do you have any other reasons for beginning of summer or are you just simply going to  avoid the wet season and health problems?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:11):**  Okay.  So there's a few reasons why aimed at that this year.  So I had kind of a pink eye issue this past year.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:20):**  I didn't doctor for anything.  I didn't doctor for any of them, but I had about, I would say close to 20% infected with  pink eye and I truly, truly believe pink eye is not a fly issue.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:34):**  It's a protein and energy imbalance issue.  So when we're coming in at spring flush and that green fescue is growing, my cows are  sporting out five feet behind them.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:46):**  And so I'm trying to minimize that.  I'm trying to, you know, if I have to this year, when my plans is, because I didn't,  I'm not going to feed much hay this winter.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:35:54):**  One of my plans is that in the spring, if the cows are, you know, ejecting out like  that, I'm going to put them tight and make them need a bale of hay to balance the energy  and protein in their gut.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:36:04):**  And you know, once again, you know, this system has to be fluent, you know, I mean, it's so  important.  I mean, if someone wants to start out and let's say they just have four or five cows,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:36:18):**  I understand you can't do what I'm doing.  Like with the calving.  I know you probably need to calve out 90% to make the farm pay or whatever, but I'm  
**[0:36:26-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:36:26):**  at a, I'm at a comfortable place in my life where I can push that a little harder.  And I would never advocate for not calving out.  I'd love, I'd love to calve out a hundred percent if all my animals were perfect, but  
**[0:36:38-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:36:38):**  I've got five on my, my whole list that's going to go, you know, and then the cows that  don't have calves, they go, this is very important.  If you run a cow calf operation, tag your calves, keep your cows tagged.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:36:51):**  Don't call off the ones that don't have calves.  In a cow calf operation, that cow's job is to have a calf.  If she doesn't have a calf, don't give her a second chance.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:01):**  I don't care if she's the best cow you ever had and she's 15 years old, get rid of her.  I don't care if prices are low.  I don't care if prices are high.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:08):**  Call her off because she did not do her job.  She did not make you money.  You fed her all year long.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:13):**  Even if you weren't feeding hay, to feed her out in pasture costs something.  Get rid of her.  Right.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:19):**  That's so important.  Keep pulling, keep moving, keep pushing your genetic pool and just, you know, just hammer  down, you know?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:26):**  Absolutely.  And, you know, we've had several conversations over the last year about, about breeding and  cattle and, you know, we definitely share a philosophy.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:36):**  So what are some of your, what are some of your cheat codes and hacks that you use?  Okay.  For the cattle side?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:48):**  Cattle side or crop side?  Okay.  So I guess I'll kind of put them together because of my operation.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:37:56):**  They're not separated.  My row crop is with my cattle side because it all goes into one pocket book and most  guys tend to separate their prices.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:06):**  My enterprises are together.  I don't separate.  So, um, so one of my, some of my cheat codes would be like with cattle.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:17):**  Apply the cow or cows on your farm that meet what you're trying to accomplish out of your  herd.  Like, I'm just going to use mine.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:26):**  For example, I like a short fat cow that's around a thousand pounds or less.  I don't want over a thousand and I'm in a really wet environment.  I don't want to pug.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:36):**  I don't want him to pug the ground up too bad.  I want red or white cattle.  I'm in Southwest Missouri.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:42):**  I have a lot of heat.  You don't get up over a hundred in the summer.  I don't want to have a black cow out there standing underneath the tree because in the  
**[0:38:49-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:49):**  summertime, sometimes my cows don't have access to shade.  They gotta be out there grazing.  So really identify what you're looking for in your herd.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:38:58):**  That is very important.  That'd be one of my cheat codes for that.  And on the row crop side, if you've got cattle and row crop, every time you're not growing  
**[0:39:05-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:05):**  a cash crop, plant a cover crop.  Our entire job as farmers and ranchers is to collect sunlight through photosynthesis.  Constantly be thinking about how to add that to your system because carbon is the main  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:16):**  driving factor of everything.  Like work carbon life forms.  Let me give an example.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:21):**  If I gave someone a vitamin pill and it had every single vitamin you needed to live, could  you live off that one pill?  Well obviously not.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:31):**  Well, why is that?  It has every vitamin you need.  When we put out fertilizer for our crops, we put out everything all the fertilizer we  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:38):**  a crop needs.  What's it missing?  It's missing carbon.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:42):**  You need that mass.  That's why that one little pill you can't survive above.  Yeah, they're in nutrient need, but it's missing the main thing you need, which is carbon.  
**[0:39:50-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:39:50):**  So if you're not growing a cash crop, grow a cover crop.  And if you've got access to cattle, graze that or custom graze it because custom grazing  is such good money and there's such little expense.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:40:07):**  I've made a lot of money off that.  I like to refer to custom grazing as a good second base hit every year.  It's just a good steady work.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:40:22):**  You're never going to hit a home run, but that's okay because you're going to be on  second base every time.  I agree, man.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:40:32):**  It makes a lot of sense.  It's a great way to turn over cash and on a farm, there's certain times when things  look pretty crappy in your bank account, but then there's other times you're like, hey,  
**[0:40:43-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:40:43):**  I'm rolling good, but you got to learn how to balance that too.  I would say to a young farmer getting started, really, really understand economics.  And every time you make a decision to buy something, think about your bottom line.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:40:56):**  Will this bring money to my operation?  So let's talk about that.  Let's talk about fertility.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:41:03):**  How do you add fertility back to your fields?  Fertilizer is a misconception.  Let me re-inslate that.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:41:15):**  Fertilizer is very subjective.  So on all my pasture ground, I've never applied any pounds of synthetic fertilizer, any litter.  The only thing I've ever applied is what comes out the back end of my cow or my chicken.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:41:28):**  So that's just how it is.  Plants make nutrients available through carbonic acid being released from the plants or micro-izing  fungi in exchange of nutrients.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:41:44):**  There's so many different ways plants make these nutrients available.  And UA, Understanding Ag, did a great study on the amount of nutrients, I think it was  50 different locations, and they took a, I believe it was a 12 inch soil sample, and  
**[0:41:59-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:41:59):**  there was like 18,000 pounds of pot ash in the organic form.  18,000 pounds.  So why are we wanting to buy all these inputs?  
**[0:42:09-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:42:09):**  I've got one farm on my own, one row crop farm, which, understand, it is a row crop  farm.  I am pulling nutrients and carbon off every time I harvest a crop, but I always have a  
**[0:42:20-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:42:20):**  cover crop growing on there, and I always have cattle grazing on those covers.  And I have never applied to this day any NP or K or any micros or any of that crap.  It's not crap.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:42:31):**  It all has its purpose, but I've not applied any of that.  And my yields aren't the highest by any means on that farm, but they are not my lowest either.  And just for some more context, my soil is less than six inches deep.  
**[0:42:47-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:42:47):**  I have a hard time pulling soil samples because we don't have much soil.  We go soil, rock layer.  I mean, we have a lot of rocks in my area, especially on my ground because I bought ground  
**[0:43:01-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:01):**  that I could afford, not the best ground in the world, but ground I can afford.  So I've got a lot of hills and stuff like that and river bottom ground.  So it's definitely not like what I would call prime farmland by any means.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:13):**  Did that answer your question?  Oh yeah, that was perfect.  One of our previous guests, to quote him, he said, we're farming subsoil because all  
**[0:43:23-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:23):**  of our topsoil is already gone.  And I think I can agree with that to some extent.  I think that's true to a broad degree in a lot of contexts.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:33):**  So if I offered you $50,000 today to invest in your business, what would you do with it  and why?  I'm a Latino.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:47):**  No, I'm just kidding.  If you gave me 50,000 days, are you doing this to me?  Okay.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:43:56):**  Hypothetically.  Okay.  Well, you mean from where I'm at now?  
**[0:44:08-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:08):**  From where I'm at now?  I would pay off my...  Yeah, if you gave me $50,000, it's going right to my nutbag farm payment.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:16):**  I'm not even acting like I ever had this, it's going right over there.  Pay down debt, improve cashflow.  Exactly.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:22):**  Knock the debt down.  Why do you want to have debt over your head?  I don't want to have debt when I'm older.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:26):**  I think in 10 years, if I quit buying ground, that's one issue my wife says, if I quit buying  ground, we wouldn't be in debt because like I said, some of our cashflow, it's really  good.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:40):**  I'm just going to give an example here.  This is from one of my corn fields.  I'm not going to give you all the breakdown, but I will explain that everything is in here.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:44:51):**  Everything from land payment to property tax, to sitting a $15 miscellaneous fee in their  crop insurance.  I put a $20 an acre drilling cost in there, which might be high.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:45:01):**  I put a $35 combining cost in there, but the net income on that farm was $416 an acre.  This was last year before these corn prices got good.  I can net that.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:45:13):**  That's pretty dang good in my opinion.  That's not my most profitable farm either.  If you get into like, if you're row cropping the row crop side and you get into like seed  
**[0:45:26-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:45:26):**  production, some of that stuff, that's really good money.  Growing is the hardest thing in my opinion, but it is one of the most important things.  I believe it says you need to spend, what is it?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:45:43):**  30, 33 per, no half your time.  You need to spend 50% of your time thinking about ways to market your product or produce  or whatever you're growing because you have all the risk out there.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:45:54):**  Why would you not try to take advantage of all the money that's out there?  That's really solid advice.  I think marketing is probably still the hardest side.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:46:08):**  I raise a lot of stuff.  I'm raising a lot more seed than I am commodities because everybody can raise commodities, but  when you start raising seed, that's a little bit better money.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:46:21):**  Reach out to seed companies.  If you're farming or starting to farm, reach out to, there's a lot of different seed companies.  I'm sure you can find them.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:46:30):**  Reach out to them and see if you can grow a product for them, whether it's wheat or  soybeans or something easy like that.  Just dip your toe in the water.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:46:39):**  I'm growing a lot of species that, I guess I shouldn't say a lot.  I'm growing some species that aren't available yet on a massive scale, but I'm starting to  get them there.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:46:53):**  This is like a three or four year process, but I'm going to get them on a massive scale  where these certain cover crop species will be available to farmers to fit their resource  concerns, if that makes sense.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:47:06):**  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  Developing new cover crops and new varieties is something that definitely needs to be done,  especially as we try to think about transitioning a lot of these cropping systems to maybe interspersed  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:47:24):**  row cropping with perennial pasture strips.  Right.  Right.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:47:29):**  I mean, it's a hell of a lot of work.  It's not easy when you're trying to start something from nothing to make it something.  There's a lot to it.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:47:39):**  I mean, I can't really go into a lot of details on it in case it fails, but it is very tough  to find something that meets that criteria and work for it.  It takes a lot of thought.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:47:53):**  I feel like my biggest asset on my farm is not my equipment or how much I labor.  I feel like it's my mind.  You have to put the thought process in it to make it work.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:05):**  Everything I do, I think it out.  I'll be laying in bed at night.  It'll be two o'clock in the morning and I'll get up and jog down a note on my phone or  
**[0:48:11-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:11):**  I'll be reading a book and it's something I'll click on.  I'm like, oh, I got to write that down or I got to remember that.  It's just constant education that is so important.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:25):**  We really don't talk about that enough.  Yeah, soil health is important, but just keep on that constant education.  Keep educating yourself.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:31):**  Keep pushing your mind as far as you can go and you'll be amazed what you can accomplish  if you just work out your brain instead of working out your muscles.  So what have you done lately to sharpen your management acts and what are you learning  
**[0:48:44-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:44):**  about right now that you're most excited about?  Well, let's see.  There's a certain breed of cattle that has really been putting a lot of effort into recently  
**[0:48:55-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:48:55):**  and studying about it and how different breeds work together and how different genetic impact  over another genetic like.  I'm just giving an example.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:06):**  A solid colored animal is dominant in the gene pool over spotted animals.  When you look at a bull, if the bulls front or the bulls back feet step in front of his  front feet, that means he's probably going to typically have a smaller birth weight.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:24):**  You know, just different things like that.  Yeah, that's to make a long story short, that's kind of what I've been into recently.  We can have long stories.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:35):**  That's OK.  We still have plenty of time.  Every podcast I get on, they go over like an hour.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:42):**  I'm like, Matt, you just need to shut up sometimes.  Oh, no.  I mean, we can go at least another hour and a half before I have anything else I need  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:50):**  to do.  Sounds good.  Check me in.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:49:53):**  So, you said you had some fails and I like to define fail as the first attempt in learning.  So what were some of your fails and what did you learn from them?  Don't get caught up in yield.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:08):**  Yield is really ignorant.  Get caught up in profit.  Number one, number two, don't get caught up in a certain person.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:16):**  Don't try to make your farm like one of the people you admire.  Your farm is not their farm because your climate is completely different.  Don't get caught up in whoever you enjoy listening to.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:26):**  Don't try to make your farm exactly like them.  I mean, I'm not going to take your cattle over there in Kansas and bring them 200 miles  this way.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:32):**  It just doesn't work.  Keep your genetics close.  I've had some failures with that.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:39):**  I mean, I've got cattle I bought 50 miles away and they come to my farm and they just  crash.  They just go to crack.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:48):**  I mean, there's just a lot of different, there's just a lot of different, I've had a lot of  failures.  I guess I shouldn't say a lot.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:50:55):**  I just keep my failures small.  You know, if I'm trying out a new cover crop or a new cash crop, I'm not going to do it  on 50 or 60 acres.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:02):**  I'm going to do it on like eight acres or 28 acres.  I'm not going to do it on a large scale.  If I change something about my herd, you know, that's another thing I didn't talk about.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:11):**  My herd stocking rate changes too throughout the year.  You know, I'm pulling cow here and if I find a cow over here I like, I might bring her  on my farm or if I've got another red farm, I'm like, hey, this cow, I think would be  
**[0:51:22-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:22):**  better suited on this farm.  I'll bring her over and vice versa.  So yeah, I mean, I guess my biggest failure I probably ever had was that original, my  
**[0:51:33-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:33):**  very first year trying to farm.  I just try to do everything that the college has told me to do and the universities and  it was a complete disaster.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:42):**  You know, this is one thing I want to say about colleges.  They bring a lot to the table for data, but all data is anecdotal.  It can all be skewed one way or another.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:51:55):**  And also college studies, it involves reduction of science.  We need to think holistically.  We're dealing with an ecosystem.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:52:06):**  We're not dealing with the single species crop that we're trying to grow this one way.  We're dealing with an ecosystem.  We have to think as a whole.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:52:16):**  I even consider when worms are most active, which in me is really early, still cold, I  might not run as high as thought density during that time.  And the reason for that is because I ran it higher in the winter normally to slow down  
**[0:52:32-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:52:32):**  my rotation, so I stomped in more litter or that residue on the soil surface.  So like worms, in a worm casting, I don't know if you guys have ever taken analysis  on a worm casting or not, but this is on average, they're about 26% carbon, 1.9% nitrogen, 1.4%  
**[0:52:49-0:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:52:49):**  potassium, 1.6% phosphorus, and around 3.7% calcium.  So I'm trying to leave them as kind of a, I guess you could say a fertilizer.  That worm cast on top of the soil is kind of like a fertilizer.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:53:03):**  It acts as a fertilizer.  It's going to decompose and be returned back to plants.  So it's just, it's always, my system is always changing and I'm always trying to just push  
**[0:53:15-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:53:15):**  the envelope.  And I think that's important.  We have to press the envelope and not be afraid to fail small.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:53:27):**  You said, you mentioned that you tried things on small acreage here and there.  The first strip grazing experiment I did on the native pasture, yeah, it was kind of impressive  scale.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:53:40):**  It was 250 acres and we jammed up 120 cows in there for 120 days.  And that was three and a half percent of the ranch.  So if I would have ruined it, if I would have set it back, it's three and a half percent  
**[0:53:54-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:53:54):**  of the ranch.  Not a big deal.  So don't be afraid to try something and fail small.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:00):**  Exactly.  And, you know, use other people's mistakes as a learning tool on your own.  I mean, listen to why their mistakes happen.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:09):**  Like, you know, for me, example, you heard how I failed with corn.  Don't do that.  If you're at a row crop, don't put all those expenses out there.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:18):**  You know, and really understand, you know, like, let's say you're starting out farming  with, or you're starting out ranching with cattle or chickens or sheep.  Maybe, like I said, look into maybe a different form of livestock.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:30):**  Maybe look into sheep over cattle.  There are less to get into.  You know, I think a lot of hues in my area, like for lambs, like over $3 a pound, I believe.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:40):**  So I mean, that's better than cattle on the side.  You know, just think about different ways to do things.  There's not one, two size fits all.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:52):**  That's just not a thing.  You know, just don't make your operation like someone else's that you admire.  That's really important.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:54:59):**  And think out everything you're going to do.  I mean, I think my biggest failures was probably because I listened to the wrong people.  I was admiring the wrong people.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:55:09):**  I was admiring these yield champions and all these people, you know.  Well, they never talked about profit.  They just talked about yield.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:55:16):**  And I had my head so shoved up there, you know what, and I couldn't think clearly.  You know, my ears were plugged, you know.  So what are some of the resources or some of the people that have really changed your  
**[0:55:30-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:55:30):**  mind or opened your mind?  What are some of those resources and maybe some of those learning experiences?  Well I've been pretty blessed, I guess.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:55:40):**  I've been able to meet a lot of great people.  My very first, I guess, official conference I went to, I guess you could say, like I'd  been studying this for a couple years before and implementing these practices, but my very  
**[0:55:54-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:55:54):**  first conference I ever went to, I was wanting to integrate animals on my cropland and I  was nervous about it.  Well, I happened to run into Michael Thompson and Michael was so open to me about stuff  
**[0:56:05-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:05):**  and he's been a great friend to me.  And then less than a month later, I mean back then, when I say money was tight, it was freaking  tight.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:16):**  I didn't want to spend anything extra, because I didn't have it.  And my wife and I grabbed up a bunch of money and went to the Soil Health Academy, or I  did, and she was supportive of me going to that.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:29):**  And that's where I met Ray and Gabe and David Clunchman and Russell Hidrick.  And you know, I'll give you a story, a short story.  We were sitting in class and Gabe was doing this presentation.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:40):**  Gabe would always, you know, Gabe will always give a slide and he'll ask the class a question.  So every time the question come up, boom, here comes my hand, you know, right up.  And I answered like questions like two or three times in a row.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:53):**  And Gabe said, come up here and get a book.  And he gave me a book.  He's like, here's dirt and soil.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:56:58):**  I'm like, Gabe, I already have this book.  He's like, oh, okay.  Well, he gave me, you know, the Soil Health Owners Manual.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:57:04):**  And he, I answer another question.  He said, kids, you watch way too much YouTube.  And so, you know, YouTube is a great resource, you know, I mean, there's a lot of great information  
**[0:57:17-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:57:17):**  on YouTube and a lot of great people to follow on YouTube.  And so like I said, I was blessed the fact that, you know, those guys, I mean, me and  Ray and David Clunchman, and we're all really tight.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:57:28):**  I mean, I talk to those guys on a weekly basis, and they're just so encouraging.  And if I have a problem or if they have a problem, you know, we can run that by each  other.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:57:41):**  I mean, I'm having a problem with me having a problem running by them.  I don't think it's other way around.  But, you know, it's just, it's just, it makes, find a good mentor.  
**[0:57:51-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:57:51):**  That's important to you know, we don't talk about that enough.  Find someone in the area that you're trying to succeed in, find a person that's done it,  and and try to make them your mentor.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:01):**  And they'll teach you so much, even if they're from different climates, they can teach you  so many great things, especially with soil, because we all have soil.  Like, even though I don't have very much of it on my land for acre, I do have soil.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:16):**  And soil works the same way.  Just follow the principles.  These principles don't change.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:22):**  I don't care if you're from the desert or from, you know, my monsoon weather, they don't  change.  Just follow the principles.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:29):**  Don't get caught up in practices and products.  So the principles, are you alluding to the six principles of soil health?  Some people say there's only five.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:39):**  I think there's yeah, yeah.  Context.  Yes, yes, that's when we say six, that is the most important context is so important.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:58:50):**  You know, understanding your why, why are you doing this is that's got to be the baseline.  You know, I'll name the principles off for you.  People haven't heard of minimize disturbance, that might mean physical, don't do tillage,  
**[0:59:03-0:59:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:59:03):**  or that might mean chemical, don't spray too much.  All of those cause disturbance in the soil.  Keep a living root as long as possible.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:59:12):**  You need to have that living root there.  You know, breaking down these, you know, feeding the biology, excreting carbon in the soil,  you know, organic matter is 50 to 58% carbon per 1% of organic matter.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:59:24):**  So 50 to 58% carbon and it's free.  Just put a freaking plant there to pump carbon in the soil or if you're grazing, just give  that plant, don't take as much off that plant so it has more tissue to capture more sunlight.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:59:36):**  I mean, that's all plants are, they're just essentially solar panels.  Keep the soil covered, you know, keep that residue, keep that litter, that fat, whatever  you want to call it on the soil surface.  
**[0:59:48-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=0:59:48):**  If you see soil on your farm, you're not doing something right.  You need to change something because you see bare dirt, whether it's, you know, and I have  bare dirt on my farm, I'm not saying I don't, but most of the time it's from like, you know,  
**[1:00:00-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:00):**  gateways, you know, where cows might travel through most of the time or it's from where  I made a mistake, like let's say accidentally spilled, you know, whatever I was going across  my field and actually spilled oats.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:09):**  I don't feed any grain to my cattle, I'm just giving an example.  But you know, then diversity of plants, nowhere, that's the next principle, diversity of plants,  nowhere in nature do you see a monoculture.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:21):**  You know, the native prairies, the forest, there's multiple species of plants growing  together.  And, you know, I've seen guys who are like, well, how can this cover crop in this multi-species  
**[1:00:33-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:33):**  does better than monoculture, people ask me that.  And I'll tell them, plants stretch for sunlight.  So if you've got a broadleaf plant, you've got a grass plant, they're both trying to  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:41):**  stretch for that sunlight.  And what are they doing as they're stretching?  They're also getting deeper roots as well.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:46):**  They're trying to stretch down because they're trying to capture as many nutrients or moisture,  whatever they might need to try to get some, to try to push up, to try to grow and capture  sunlight.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:00:57):**  And then I would call the final principle, you know, this has kind of been taken out  of context a little bit, you know, some guys say animal integration, but let's think animal  and insect integration.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:08):**  Insects play such a huge role.  There's more insects on this planet than there is herbivores.  So they play a very important role in this too.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:16):**  So just don't use dewormers.  Don't use these neonics on your corn.  You know, I don't, all my corn and beans, none of them are treated with neonics.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:25):**  I don't use any insecticides on my farm.  Actually, let me take that back.  I have in the past used insecticide, but that was because it was so economically devastating.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:35):**  Even after I sprayed, it still sucks.  So you know, you're going to have issues like that, but never in my past have I sprayed  for insects or used dewormers.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:45):**  So you know, that insect integration too is important.  Think about, think about, you know, the dung beetles and what they can do for your soil.  I mean, I think me and Brian share pictures of dung beetles back and forth, and I've got  
**[1:01:55-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:55):**  like one or two on my farm that I found.  I do have a roller.  Oh my gosh.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:01:59):**  Did I tell you that story, Brian?  I haven't heard it yet, but aren't they cool?  Oh my gosh, dude, they're the best, man.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:07):**  I don't care what it is.  If I find a dung beetle, I'm going to watch him.  If I'm busy, I'm stopping to watch him because they're freaking awesome, man.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:15):**  The very first time I ever seen a roller, my friend David Clenshmit was by, he works  for Understanding Ag, he's a consultant.  Super smart guy, awesome dude.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:24):**  We were sitting there, you know, having a drink and barbecuing one night.  He come down from, I think he was over in Kansas on a consulting trip and come over  and save me and my wife for a night.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:36):**  And all of a sudden something was rolling and hitting the lights.  I'm like, David, what is that?  He goes, Matt, I think that's a dung beetle.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:44):**  And so we went, you know, we went into like ninja mode or whatever, caught that little  turd, put him in a jar, and then of course, you know, what's the thing you do with a dung  beetle?  
**[1:02:54-1:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:54):**  He goes, it's a cow path.  So I took him out, we took him out of the cow path, it's probably like one o'clock at  night.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:02:59):**  We got my phone light out, you know, we got the phone light right there on him, and we're  watching him dig around the cow path.  Coolest thing ever.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:05):**  I mean, freaking awesome, you know.  I mean, there's, they're just, and he was big too.  I mean, he was like silver dollar size.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:11):**  It was freaking awesome.  Oh, good.  I'm a high energy person.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:14):**  Oh, we love it.  We love it.  Love the energy.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:17):**  I mean, Brian and I did the same thing in his, at his branch when we found some dung  beetles, we were like, oh, this is cool.  This is great.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:29):**  Now you have a lot more.  So absolutely.  Well, I don't know if I do or not.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:35):**  Like I said, I've maybe seen two or three, but by God, if I see one, I'm going to stop  and look at them work because they're just a fascinating insect.  But yeah, to answer your question earlier, Brian, that's the principle of soul health.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:46):**  I mean, follow those principles and it's hard for your farm to fail if you follow those  principles.  Good deal.  
**[1:03:52-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:03:52):**  So you mentioned about keeping cattle close and I know you and I have had a couple of  discussions about that.  So let's talk about that before we continue on down this, down another rabbit trail.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:02):**  I like to get cattle as close as I can because their epigenetics are more adapted to your  environment.  Like I said, I took cattle from 50 miles away or less and brought them to my farm and they  
**[1:04:16-1:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:16):**  just go to crap.  And maybe it's my management.  Maybe I'm a little, maybe I'm harder than that guy was on the cattle or maybe he supplemented  
**[1:04:24-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:24):**  them grain or whatever it might be.  My farm is, when I say grass fed, I mean, it's literally, they don't get grain.  The only grain they might get that of a seed head occasionally.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:35):**  I mean, literally they just, they stick to grass.  And so they have to be adapted to grass on my farm or they're not going to make it.  So or even stocks, I grade stock too in the winter.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:46):**  So they gotta be able to survive on that too and hold body condition.  When I say survive, I don't mean literally die.  Just to clarify, I mean their body condition dropped.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:04:58):**  I don't want my animals below like a six in the winter.  I really don't want them below that.  Now I know the Korean story, but you give up, you're giving up something there.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:05:10):**  So keep, if you're going to go and let's say buy like a breeding bull, don't go three or  four states over because that seems like a disaster to me.  And that's just what I've experienced.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:05:20):**  Have you experienced the same thing?  Not necessarily on the breeding bulls.  I sourced my bulls from a guy that's only about 30 or so miles away.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:05:31):**  But there is something to be said about if you are going to import a bull from a long  distance away, you should either have him in a similar pasture to where he's going with  the cows for about 60 days in order for his digestive tract to adapt to the forest change  
**[1:05:50-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:05:50):**  and in semen quality to go ahead and cycle and get back to optimum.  Or you should bring that bull that's traveled a long distance and put him directly with  the cows before his semen quality starts to suffer because he's on a different forage  
**[1:06:07-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:07):**  than he's used to.  Right.  And one thing, I'm sure you know this too, but a little bit older bull can produce a  
**[1:06:15-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:15):**  lot more semen than a younger bull.  So I don't mind having a, I mean, a lot of guys in my area after a bull is five years  old, he's going off their farm.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:26):**  I mean, he's gone.  And to me, that seems like a failure of a bull.  And this is my opinion.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:31):**  I'm not really basing this off the facts or anything, but I like an older bull.  I mean, to me, that would almost, it kind of sounds weird, but would maybe bring some  more maternal traits or some more lasting traits into a herd.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:45):**  I don't want to buy this young 18 month bull every year.  And that's just on my farm.  I mean, that doesn't work for everybody, but that's just what I do.  
**[1:06:52-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:06:52):**  Right.  So you've got a lot of, how do you feel about all the epigenetic testing going on now?  Or do you put more faith in your cattleman's eye and looking at phenotype?  
**[1:07:04-1:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:04):**  Yeah.  So I don't pay any attention to real EPDs.  So yeah, I mean, really most of my, when I pick an animal out, it's a visual thing and  
**[1:07:19-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:19):**  it's kind of, when I go to buy an animal, you're going to probably get interrogated  by me because if I'm going to buy an animal, I want that animal to meet these certain traits.  And I'm going to ask you a lot of questions like, how do you feed them in the winter?  
**[1:07:32-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:32):**  How's he fed here?  Do you move your cattle?  Are they adapted to a poly wire?  
**[1:07:38-1:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:38):**  Do they know how to forge through snow and things like that?  I'm going to ask you tough questions like that.  And a lot of producers, they don't even know how to answer those questions.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:48):**  Like I'll ask guys, like, if I'm going to buy some cattle and I'm like, I don't really  pay attention.  And that's just me.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:07:56):**  I really try to observe the animal before I buy one and try to make a good decision.  And not all my animals are, I mean, even like I said earlier, they're not where I want to  be yet.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:07):**  My herd is not where it wants to be yet.  I'm working on a few projects and it's changing and it's changing fast.  Right.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:15):**  I get that.  And I'm not where I want to be either.  And I think we both have a very similar goal in mind.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:22):**  And in our previous two guests, we all feel very, very similarly about our philosophies  of breeding and management.  And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to have you on.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:33):**  So what's the best advice that you wish you'd gotten on the day you started?  Best advice?  Yeah.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:43):**  Back to what I said earlier, really focus on principles, don't get caught up in equipment.  A lot of guys, they want to go into farming because they like tractors, they like machinery.  Steel does not pay the bills.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:08:59):**  So the more steel you got on your farm, the more your farm is going to cost you.  So my equipment is literally like bare minimum.  I don't have big equipment by any means, but I raised so many crops.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:09:11):**  I'm not raising, when I have 650 acres of crop, it's not all corn and soybeans.  Every one of my farms this past year had a different crop growing on it.  So it's really, just to get back to your question, just focus on the soil, don't focus on equipment,  
**[1:09:32-1:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:09:32):**  don't focus on these amendments that you think you have to apply to your row crop land or  your cattle even, or your livestock.  I seen a guy the other day post on, I guess, I don't know what he posted on, but he's like,  
**[1:09:47-1:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:09:47):**  hey, what kind of dewormers do you guys eat on your chickens?  I don't use any dewormers on my chickens.  I didn't know that was a thing.  
**[1:09:52-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:09:52):**  So I guess I'm really uneducated.  So man, you've mentioned your chickens twice and we haven't even got a chance to talk about  it.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:00):**  Do you want to talk about your chickens and why chickens?  Okay, so my chickens is a non-profit organization.  They don't make any money.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:14):**  They do cost money.  They're mostly just a hobby of mine.  I do sell eggs.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:20):**  We've got around 50 something chickens right now because predation is high.  I lose a lot of coyotes.  I mean, on my farm, it's survival of the fittest chickens.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:34):**  And I've got an egg mobile that I kind of copied design off of a Gabe Brown from, and  it's got like laying nests in the back opening door.  It's got a solar panel door on it.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:44):**  It's got two 25 pound feeders so that I can put a stack of feet in there.  And my chickens don't really cost me a whole lot because I see leftover screening from  some of my cash crop upgrades.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:10:56):**  So like lespedeza, I raised Korean lespedeza, not to be confused with sericea, but I raised  Korean lespedeza.  And the screenings and the cracks off that, there's a lot of daughter and smart weed,  
**[1:11:11-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:11:11):**  small lespedeza, unhold lespedeza and things like that that go into those screenings.  And my chickens eat a lot of that.  And my kids, I mean, my kids love the chickens.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:11:25):**  My daughter earlier today, I made some fresh orange juice yesterday, me and my son did.  So we peeled two big bags of orange juice and we made our own orange juice.  And we took out all the peels and all the crap that's not juice.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:11:40):**  I don't know what that stuff's called, but whatever it is.  And we took that out there to them earlier this morning.  We called them and here they all come and run and climb and feed them.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:11:49):**  Yeah, it's just fun.  It's just, that's something that I enjoy.  I think in farming or ranching, we need to find things that we enjoy.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:11:58):**  And I enjoy, I enjoy, I don't enjoy death.  I don't like to use herbicides.  I don't like using insecticides.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:12:04):**  I don't like, I don't use any fungicides, but I don't like to use that stuff because  it's not enjoyable to me.  I don't want to kill anything really.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:12:11):**  I just want to grow something.  And I think that's an important distinction.  And you know, a lot of people that get into the regenerative sphere, they just wake up  
**[1:12:20-1:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:12:20):**  in the morning and get excited about what new life they're going to go look for, what  new life they're going to find that day out in their fields.  It makes you feel good, doesn't it?  
**[1:12:32-1:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:12:32):**  Yeah, it does.  You know, dung beetles, dung beetles are some of my favorite employees.  They're awful hardworking and they don't take sick days.  
**[1:12:41-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:12:41):**  So if you could share a meal with any three people alive or dead, who would they be and  why?  Oh, probably Thomas Paine, Rand Paul, you know, and yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:09):**  I'm sorry, Ron.  Okay.  And probably my dad.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:14):**  Those would probably be the three for obvious reasons, I feel like.  Pretty good solid choices, I feel.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:25):**  Is that, you know, my political views are the same as my farming views.  Yeah.  Just, I mean, I'm not going to get into politics, but that's kind of how I feel.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:39):**  You know, I don't, this past year, I didn't take any subsidies off my row crop land.  You know, they, I did for some reason get money deposited in my account for the, from  the, oh, the stainless bill or whatever, you know, for me and my wife.  
**[1:13:55-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:55):**  Oh, the COVID release.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:13:58):**  All that bull.  Yeah.  That money.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:01):**  Yeah.  That's how you feel.  Yeah.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:04):**  So I don't, I don't take any, I don't take any of that crap.  I don't, you know, this year, all my cover crops, I paid for myself in my own pocket.  So that's important to, you know, guys like, oh, he must be doing cover crops because the  
**[1:14:16-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:16):**  government pays for them.  No, no, I don't.  I don't use cover crops because government pays for them.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:24):**  And I don't, I don't take any cost share on cover crops.  So I thought you were gonna get me fired up there for a second.  Well, if you want to get fired up, go ahead.  
**[1:14:35-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:35):**  Don't let me stop you.  Nope, next question.  Okay.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:39):**  Well, you, it may give you a good chance to get fired up.  If you were in charge, we're just going to put you in charge of whatever.  What's the first change you're going to make?  
**[1:14:54-1:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:54):**  If I was in charge of the Department of Agriculture, if I was in the president, or what are you  talking about?  Sure, you pick.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:14:59):**  Okay.  How much power do you want to have, Mac?  Give it all to me, buddy.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:15:09):**  If I was the president, my one job would be not take my check and do nothing and try to  take away all regulation I possibly can.  That way to not restrict small businesses.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:15:20):**  So yeah, I would pretty much do nothing and suppress everything I could through the executive  power.  I mean, yeah, that's, if I was in the government small again.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:15:34):**  Yes, well, yeah, make the government small again or make the government back to the Constitution  again or something.  Yeah, I don't know.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:15:43):**  I'm coming on the mose line.  And also, if I was in charge of the Department of Agriculture, I'd probably shut that branch  down because it's pretty much useless like every other branch.  
**[1:15:54-1:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:15:54):**  Well said, sir.  Well said.  So we are kind of coming toward the end of our time today.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:00):**  And the thing we've started doing is we'll turn the tables.  It's your turn.  You can, do you have any questions, anything you'd like to ask either me or CK real quick?  
**[1:16:13-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:13):**  Yeah, I do.  How do you guys feel about white cattle?  I think that any color cattle is a good color.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:22):**  I think that they are all red and meaty on the inside.  Right.  I think they're a little more heat tolerant when you're a region too.  
**[1:16:32-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:32):**  Anything else?  I think a lot of the industries got caught up in color.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:38):**  Got caught up in color and tried to breed for color and breed for appearance and not  necessarily breed for things that are important like fertility and feed efficiency and low  input cost.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:52):**  Right, right.  No, I see that.  I can see that.  
**[1:16:58-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:16:58):**  Yeah.  How about, I mean, you say that now, are you, I mean, I know you get pretty warm in the  summer, don't you?  
**[1:17:06-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:06):**  I mean, are you for more slick cattle or haired cattle or what do you kind of feel about that?  I prefer my cattle to slick off in the late spring.  And that's one thing I'm going to start.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:16):**  That's one thing I'm really going to take note of this year is the uniformity of hair  coats and the uniformity of when they shed.  And because early shedding is a good indicator of fertility and hormonal balance.  
**[1:17:31-1:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:31):**  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[1:17:34-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:34):**  That's kind of where I'm kind of going to.  I want my animals to be more uniform.  I don't like to have one cow that's large and all the others or one cow that's hair  
**[1:17:42-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:42):**  and all the others.  I want more, maybe that's not, maybe that's another aspect that maybe I need to work on  mentally because I'm trying to put my stuff in a box.  
**[1:17:51-1:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:17:51):**  I just feel like we always start putting nature in a box, you know, and we didn't think outside  the box, but that's definitely an hour long question for me.  I have animals that have pretty heavy hair coats throughout the summer and they do just  
**[1:18:13-1:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:18:13):**  as good as my slick cattle.  And they're from the same breed.  You know this, I race South Pole cows.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:18:20):**  Yeah.  And then I've got commercial cattle too.  So I think, yeah.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:18:25):**  For you think about that from a physiological aspect, like let's say dogs.  You have dogs who people shave their dogs right in the summertime.  And I think sometimes that's a no-no because their coats are there and they actually, if  
**[1:18:42-1:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:18:42):**  you let them, they can shed that heat just as well as an animal that has slick hair.  And so I think it's almost like a common misconception that because they have fur or longer hair,  they're not going to be as heat tolerant as something that's slicked back.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:18:58):**  And that doesn't necessarily mean that because it's a continental breed, like they're just  not as heat tolerant as these bromine cattle or these indica cattle, right?  So because they don't have that thick skin.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:19:07):**  And so I think we have to look at it as more of a, like a physiological reason and like,  what does that actually do?  That actually is a protective barrier to help them either wick the heat better or not retain  
**[1:19:22-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:19:22):**  it as much.  No, that's a good point.  Yeah.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:19:26):**  I've not really thought about like in that kind of, I don't know, I thought about it  in that way.  That's a good point.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:19:31):**  I've noticed that I've got black cattle that I've got commercial cattle that do just as  good in the heat as some of my red cattle do or white.  And I think that we just need to, maybe instead of looking for individual traits, maybe we  
**[1:19:51-1:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:19:51):**  need to look at the individual animal itself.  The animal itself, not what it looks like, not how it does.  But there is one thing that is pretty consistent.  
**[1:20:01-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:20:01):**  I feel like this personally, animal is going to eat what approximately 10% of their body  weight a day.  So I don't want a 1,800 pound cow or even a 15 pound cow.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:20:15):**  Yeah, that's going to take more to feed.  So I think there is, like I said, yeah, like we were just talking about, I think it's based  upon the animal itself, not maybe based upon what you're looking for in the animal.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:20:31):**  Good solid advice.  Yeah, is there anything new that's going on with you, Brian?  Are you working on anything or is there anything new that you want to share with me or your  
**[1:20:42-1:20:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:20:42):**  listeners?  Oh, I guess I've got a high school student that's starting kind of on a work share program,  not a job shadowing thing.  
**[1:20:56-1:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:20:56):**  Young man that's been interested in agriculture.  I actually, his aunt was in my class.  So it's kind of a neat opportunity.  
**[1:21:08-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:21:08):**  We spent a couple hours together yesterday and by the time this airs, hopefully he'll  have been around for a month and hopefully he turns out good.  Yeah, see, I've never had good luck with stuff like that.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:21:22):**  I've had a few interns in the past and they end up just not showing up.  He's well recommended and he's still so far pretty reliable.  Good, good.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:21:37):**  That's hard to find.  It's very hard to find.  And like I said earlier, maybe not, we have to work hard at certain times, but I really  
**[1:21:49-1:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:21:49):**  feel like maybe we overwork ourselves.  Have you ever noticed that?  I look at some farmers that farm four or 5,000 acres and they just look like crap constantly  
**[1:22:00-1:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:00):**  because they're under so much stress.  Have you noticed that?  Yeah, I think there was a myth for a long time that, and it's really prevalent here  
**[1:22:13-1:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:13):**  because of the culture and the types of people that settled in this area, that you just have  to work harder.  Just keep working, just keep working harder, keep busy all the time.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:26):**  Got to be doing something all the time.  Just put in more hours.  I don't think that works.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:34):**  No, I don't like it either.  You got to have a quality of life, you know?  Absolutely.  
**[1:22:41-1:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:41):**  And I think I had that thought too when you said you pushed back your calving bait and  you're not doing it in the rain anymore.  And I was like, that must be so much better because the most miserable thing I can remember  
**[1:22:51-1:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:51):**  when calving up cows was in the rain.  That was the worst thing.  I could do it in the snow, I could do it in the dead heat of the summer, but in the rain  
**[1:22:59-1:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:22:59):**  it's miserable.  So I have to think your mindset is a little bit better because you're not dealing with  calves hitting this muddy pasture and everything else.  
**[1:23:09-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:23:09):**  Oh yeah, there's some issues with that.  I mean, a lot of guys make fun of me because they're like, oh, you have a moisture problem.  Well, you know, everyone in their own environment restricts their soul health.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:23:22):**  Like you know, I mean, I'm close to Michael Thompson, you know, I mean, he's pretty dry  and you know, he has a hard time getting stuff to come up sometimes because it's so dry.  He can't get germination on, on cover crops and I'm complete opposite.  
**[1:23:37-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:23:37):**  Like last year I planted one farm three times as excessive rain and then come June 1st,  we cut off.  I mean, we didn't have rain for like 80 some days.  
**[1:23:50-1:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:23:50):**  So it's just, it's very hard.  One thing about, it's so hard to row crop and that's why I am wanting to get away from  where, when my land's paid off, I want to have way more animals in one herd than I do  
**[1:24:07-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:24:07):**  a bunch of row crop fields.  That's kind of one of my goals in my farm.  That sounds great.  
**[1:24:11-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/3-Macauley-Kincaid-All-Data-is-Anecdotal-ernp21#t=1:24:11):**  Well, Mack, it's been a really great conversation today and I really appreciate you taking the  time out of your busy schedule to join us.  So where can we find you on social media and is there any website or product that you want

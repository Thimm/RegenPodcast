**[0:00:55-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:00:55):**  We've got Dan Ventiker from Honey Creek Dairy all the way in Eastern Iowa to give us yet  another perspective on the dairy industry.  So Dan, welcome to the show.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:05):**  Thanks for having me.  It's my pleasure to be here.  So just before the show we were talking a little bit about your dairy.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:14):**  What if you tell us how you got your name and where you're at and what kind of environment  you're in.  Sure.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:19):**  So a brief history on our farm.  My great grandparents bought this operation, this farm here in 1941.  The only building that's actually still here is the house.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:28):**  Every other building has been updated or replaced as things age and go on.  My grandparents bought the farm for my great grandparents a few years later.  And they farmed from the 50s to the 70s kind of as a mixed operation, kind of like a lot  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:42):**  of the way farms were back then.  In the 70s they really focused more on dairy.  They liked milking cows.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:48):**  They thought, hey, this is an area we really enjoy.  So that's where they put a lot of their focus.  And then through the 80s the milk cows really got them through the 80s farm crisis.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:01:56):**  My grandpa added a few more cows, literally milked his way through it.  And then we just kind of kept focusing on the cows, picked up a few acres through the  80s and mainly through the 90s.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:02:08):**  We milked it, my grandparents milked it in an old stanchion barn.  Any dairyman listening in will know what I mean by a stanchion barn.  The year 2000 they put in a parlor.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:02:16):**  We put in a freestyle barn in 1996.  We might talk about that a little later.  But our primary housing style for our dairy cows is a freestyle barn.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:02:24):**  Again, that was built in 1996.  So from 2000 to 2019 we milked out of that freestyle barn in a parlor.  In 2015, let me back up, in 2013 my brother and I graduated from Iowa State University.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:02:38):**  I have a degree in dairy science, a bachelor's degree.  Don has a bachelor's degree in, what is it, agricultural systems technology.  We farmed with my dad and my uncle.  
**[0:02:50-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:02:50):**  From when we graduated to 2015, my uncle decided to retire.  My brother and I formed Honey Creek Dairy LLC.  We bought my uncle's half the farm in 2015.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:00):**  In 2019 we installed, we added on to our freestyle barn that was built in 96.  We made it a little bigger.  We put some robots on the east end of it.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:08):**  We have three Laylee A5 milking robots.  We also added a Laylee Vekkert, which is the first automated feeding system in the state  of Iowa.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:16):**  So that's been some exciting technology on our end of things.  So now we're two years running into the new barn with the new technology and I'm really  happy to say things are going quite well.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:27):**  Wow, you covered a lot of stuff there.  I was just busy taking notes to make sure we kind of circled back to cover some of that  stuff.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:36):**  I'm really interested about how the robots incorporate into your operation.  First, what kind of land base are you operating on there?  How many acres do you have and what are you using for and how many cattle are you running  
**[0:03:50-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:03:50):**  through your dairy operation?  So we have right around 335-ish acres.  We're milking 190 cows and we raise all of our own young stock.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:00):**  We've been what you would call a fully closed herd since about 19, I'll ask my dad, 1975,  something like that, which means when my grandpa decided to focus more on milking cows, he  bought the neighbor's herd who decided to sell.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:16):**  And we've never had an animal from another farm come onto this farm since 1975.  We've grown from 70 milking head to 190 fully internally with our own offspring.  My dad used to bull breed, obviously to keep genetics separate, we used to buy bulls in.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:33):**  I was going to ask about that.  Have you guys been line breeding since 75?  That might be-  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:38):**  No, that's an important distinction.  Line breeding when it works, right?  Right, right.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:41):**  No, that's an important distinction.  As for the females, yeah, they're often fully internal.  Now we're fully artificially inseminated on the whole herd.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:50):**  Right, that's how you control the outcrossing then.  Right, right.  So and we can just improve the genetics a little bit faster.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:04:57):**  That's a whole other thing.  And you guys are familiar with what AI is.  Yeah, are you guys doing any ET stuff then too to slow down the performers?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:06):**  Not yet.  Part of the robots was to give me more time to do more herd management things.  When we had the parlor, we were, I mean it was from four, I woke up at four and I had  
**[0:05:16-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:16):**  to be out the door at 4.15 and I busted my butt until 9.30, 10 o'clock just to get morning  chores done.  And then we had to go crop farm 335 acres after that, haul the manure, take care of  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:27):**  the livestock.  So that 4.30 to 9 o'clock was just milking cows.  That was it.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:33):**  And then it was 3.30 to 7 in the afternoon.  So these robots really freed up that schedule.  So I'm hoping down the road, like embryo transfer, those kinds of things are things we can kind  
**[0:05:41-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:41):**  of start to incorporate into our herd.  Yeah, it's also really hard to find good employees who want to do that same kind of work that  you were just talking about.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:51):**  Because it's hard work and it's long work.  It's more the long.  Like milking cows wasn't labor intensive, it wasn't like we were chucking, my dad used  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:05:59):**  to do 30,000 small square bales every summer when he was growing up.  We're not doing anything like that.  But it was just, it's just boring, monotonous.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:08):**  Robot herds actually have, if you have robots and you need to hire people, they actually  have better luck finding employees because people are attracted to work that requires  a higher caliber of thinking.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:20):**  You know what I mean?  So you can just attract a higher caliber of employee versus milking cows, people that  are good employees don't stick around long because they want to better themselves.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:29):**  I don't blame them.  You know, they want to keep working their way up, find a better paying job.  And dairy is unfortunately just can't afford to pay, you know, 20, $25 an hour for a milker.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:41):**  I think that's a whole different podcast right there.  How bad minimum wage is going to be for agriculture?  Yeah.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah.  And back to your question about like land base and everything.  So we, we, before we went through our farm transition, when we bought my uncle's half,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:06:58):**  we had around 700 acres, but we went through a farm transition.  There was two families involved here.  So everything kind of got split.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:03):**  So they took half and we took half and they crop farm and they have side jobs.  They really like doing mechanics, my uncle and his son, my cousin.  So that really fit them well.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:13):**  They weren't big on the, you know, getting really hard and heavy at the dairy industry.  Like we were, me and my brother.  And so we took the other half and we dairy farm it.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:20):**  So we're able to, you know, we, we do buy some feed in, but for the most part, every  forage we grow our own.  The only things we buy in would be like soybean meal for some protein supplement, cotton seed  
**[0:07:32-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:32):**  for like a fatty acid supplement.  And like some kind of calf starter, you know, those texturized feeds.  But for the most part, we try to grow as much as we can ourselves.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:45):**  Interesting.  So I know, you know, I primarily know you from TikTok and your Iowa dairy farmer on  there for anybody that's on TikTok.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:07:56):**  You're talking about your soil carbon tests.  You want to talk about your soil carbon tests?  Yeah.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:02):**  Well, and I'm very interested.  And I'm really glad when you and I kind of first, I don't want to say butted heads, but  when you and I first met in TikTok world, I wouldn't say it was butting heads.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:15):**  It was just kind of like, we were, but we, we kind of, our worlds collided on, I forget  it was some TikTok posts where somebody was like, yeah, I'm glad you're more open than  this guy and that guy.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:28):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so I never, I had actually never seen your TikTok until he had tagged me in it,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:34):**  but I watched your videos and like this guy doesn't come off, you know, forward at all.  And I understand that some other TikTok accounts about regenerative ag or these topics or that  topic, they do come off more forward.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:45):**  I understand that.  And but that's kind of how you and I met.  Well, it's hard to talk about some of these things without stepping on toes or making  
**[0:08:56-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:08:56):**  somebody feel like you're making them out to be a villain or you're attacking them.  But that's like the problem in ag too, right?  We drew the lane and then we decided to villainize ourselves.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:06):**  And I don't know if that's a word, but it's like, no we're, we need to figure out commonplace  or whatever.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:14):**  The problem is, and I don't want to come off forward or villainizing somebody, but some  guys you, you and I, we all can agree.  I might tick off somebody listening on the podcast, but there's some guys that just don't  
**[0:09:23-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:23):**  need to do what they do.  Like I know a guy in this area, he fall chisel plows at 13 inches deep, spring cultivates,  then he put soybeans in it.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:32):**  And the guy next to him just no-tills the soybeans and they're getting the same yield.  So one of those is clearly better for the soil if you know what I mean.  So yeah, that kind of stuff.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:41):**  It's hard for me to say that.  And if that guy who's in this area is listening in, he's going to go, well screw Dan.  He doesn't, he doesn't know.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:48):**  You know what I mean?  So, but anyway, it's back to the carbon thing.  That's kind of how you and I first met.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:09:54):**  I forget which TikTok it was.  It was something about what we do for our ground.  There's so many of them.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, I've done too many, but we do things a little different than some dairies around  here, but I'm kind of proud to say that I'm starting to see more of it in this area.  So I'm not saying I'm a trendsetter, but I think more and more guys are experimenting  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:15):**  with this stuff.  So when we went through our farm split in 2015, my uncle and my cousin took all the  tillage equipment.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:23):**  I mean, we used, I grew up moldboarding, man.  I love moldboard plowing.  I still love it.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, it was a fun thing to do, but when we, so all of a sudden I had no tillage equipment.  I had no planner.  I had to do something and I figured till, I mean a good, even a vertical tillage tool,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:39):**  which you know, that's kind of a minimum till concept.  Those were like 40 grand.  And so I could buy a planner, a no till planner for like 20 grand.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:47):**  So I did that.  And, uh, you know, again, I was, I was just young and getting started farming, but the  first year I was farming, we didn't do any cover crops and we have to haul some manure  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:10:58):**  through the winter.  I don't have enough manure storage to get through the winter.  And obviously here in Iowa, we can't pasture through the winter.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:03):**  There's six foot of snow out there, some not six foot, but you get my point.  So what really scared me though, was I put manure out in the field all winter long.  I get out to the field next March, there's no manure out there and I don't want anybody  
**[0:11:16-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:16):**  to throw them under the bus and think I washed it all the way into the river.  Cause I didn't put that much manure out there that winter, but that fertilizer that I put  out there that I want to use to nourish crops and replant the soil was gone.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:27):**  So that fall I put cover crop down and that next spring, you know, so we, we do nitrate  tests sometime and I also started doing, you probably are familiar with it, it's called  the soil Haney test.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:35):**  I have a friend.  Yeah.  And so we've started, we started making that deal back.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:38):**  The Liz Haney soil test.  But that cover crop is completely shocked me on, I mean, I don't know if we're retaining  a hundred percent of the manure, but I'm very, very confident that, you know, the amount  
**[0:11:53-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:11:53):**  of manure that would ever run off has to be as close to zero as I could ever get.  And we're putting, we're putting a bushel and a half of rye out there in the field.  And I wish I could show you some pictures on here.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:03):**  Maybe I can show you on my phone, but I mean, it's a complete green mat out in the field.  And so right when we get corn off in the fall, we are chasing the chopper with the drill  to get rye on.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:13):**  And we let that grow nice and tall.  So when we put manure on through the winter, that rye before we put manure on is six, eight  inches tall or more.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:21):**  And so that carries our wheel traffic.  It prevents, it helps us with compaction.  It's holding manure back.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:26):**  And then next in the spring, what I'll do is we'll, we'll terminate that with glyphosate  or 2, 4-D and then we'll no till right into that rye.  We don't do any tillage of any kind.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:36):**  I want to get to the point where I can go into it green and without spraying it right  away and then let it live and get taller.  I just got to make a few adjustments to my planer before I can make that happen.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:47):**  I think some guys let that rye get pretty tall and use a roller crimper to just roll  it flat and then no till straight into that.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:12:56):**  It's got to get headed out and cause you can only kill it when it gets to a certain  state.  If you roll it too soon, it won't die.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:04):**  So that is something I want to experiment with.  I really do.  The catch is when I see six foot or five foot tall rye and I have some peppers to feed,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:13):**  I think that's good.  I can mow that.  I can mow that and I could feed it.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:17):**  So I wouldn't mind having a few more acres and I, you know, there's going to be an exodus  of old farmers in this area.  So I want to get myself in a position where I can afford to buy some more acres and do  
**[0:13:27-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:27):**  some more experimenting with stuff like that.  But via the soil test we've been doing, even since 20, when I go back to our soil maps  in 2012, we've pushed our organic, I've got to look how much organic matter went up.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:37):**  I don't think it was a full like point and a half yet.  But we've been able to slowly start getting organic matter back up, which that's something  that makes me really excited.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:13:48):**  Soil organic matter increasing is, I mean, that's never, never a bad thing.  You know, we were just talking about this morning, we're working calves with some of  my neighbors that, you know, we've been around forever and it's like the average age and  
**[0:14:01-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:01):**  agriculture just keep going up every year and eventually there's going to be a cliff.  That's not always going to happen by reckoning, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:10):**  And it's tough because even in the dairy industry, people love these small family farms and I'm  under the average for dairy herds.  I think the average dairy nationwide is like 250.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:19):**  So I'm smaller than that.  And everybody really just gets worked up about that.  But people don't understand, people aren't leaving the dairy industry all the time because  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:29):**  it's low pay.  It's just because people are retiring, there's nobody to take it over.  You know, the reason herds have expanded so much is just because there's a void of people  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:38):**  to take those cows over and farm it.  So the bigger guy just buys them because there's nobody else.  There's no other smaller guys to buy.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:45):**  Yeah.  It's not another new 200 head operation.  It's the 2000 head mega dairy, just getting another 10%.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:14:53):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So you know, on the dairy side of things, it's kind of a double edged sword for me.  The bigger you get, a lot of people that I argue with on TikTok, they think these big  
**[0:15:06-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:06):**  farms are horrible for the cows.  They're horrible for the animals.  Honestly, some of the bigger farms are probably, they probably have better animal welfare than  
**[0:15:15-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:15):**  some of these small family farms, to be perfectly honest, in terms of the dairy cow itself.  You know, having good management, good welfare practices for that dairy cow, good cow comfort.  Bigger is absolutely not worse for the animal.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:27):**  Now like me personally, would I rather see 10 small family farms versus one big farm?  Absolutely.  I really would.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:35):**  There's just not enough people interested in dairy farming.  So it's just, it's so easy for those big guys just to keep getting bigger.  So what do you think the difference is that the correlation with the bigger branches having  
**[0:15:45-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:45):**  better protocols for animal welfare because they have to delegate it to someone else or  is it the small families having too much to do with just like, let's say 30 animals and  that's the one that doesn't get prioritized?  
**[0:15:58-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:15:58):**  Yeah.  When you have a thousand, 2000 or I know a farm in central Iowa, they have 10,000 cows.  It's one guy's job to make sure those dairy cows always have the sand they need.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:09):**  It's bigger.  They use sand bedding in their stalls like I do.  Or it's one guy's job to take care of those calves.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:15):**  You know, it's, if you have one role, like here on this farm, me and my brother, we do  the robot maintenance.  We have the sand, we do the calves, we do the crops, we do everything.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:23):**  So I'd be lying if I said sometimes there might be a cow who could use some ketosis  pills or some aspirin for a sore foot or something this morning.  And all of a sudden there's rain coming and I go mow head or I want to go get the hay  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:35):**  chop.  And that cow didn't get that aspirin or that, you know, bantamete or something when she  should have because something else took its place in terms of urgency.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:43):**  And that's not you being cruel.  That's us as a producer having to make a choice.  Right.  
**[0:16:50-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:16:50):**  And everything, nothing is black and white, except Holsteins.  There's some brown ones.  There are some brown ones.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:00):**  But that is seriously, that's the advantage that these 10,000 cow farms have.  Sometimes I'm envious of that, that I, my job, if all I had to do was worry about these  robots and that's it, my job would be so much less stressful.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:12):**  But all of a sudden now we're coming in a drought and I got to figure out, okay, do  I have enough feed?  Do I have enough of this?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:18):**  Do I have enough of this?  Do I have enough of this?  I got to get in for the rain crop.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:21):**  Now I got to go spray it.  I got to go side dress.  And, you know, that's, that's just kind of the burden of being a smaller operation.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:25):**  That's what pushes a lot of guys away from it.  You know, and I'm pretty sure I said this on the last two podcasts.  I mean, y'all dairymen are the hardest working guys in agriculture.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:34):**  Oh, absolutely.  And what robots are making that a lot more, are making our schedules more flexible.  If you've seen any of my TikToks, you know, I did one a while ago about just why we did  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:46):**  it.  I mean, I'm not going to get my kids.  That's most of it.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:49):**  We honestly decided that, I mean, this was not risk-free.  I mean, this was a big, big gamble for us.  Without the robots, you're a slave to those cows and their schedule.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:17:58):**  And with the robots, they can keep the cow schedule.  You just have to make sure the robot works.  Right.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:04):**  And if I'm not here, my, our local service technician's 11 miles away.  So I just got out to pay him, you know, a hundred bucks an hour to come fix it.  But at least, at least somebody can do it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:13):**  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  You're telling me you're a dairyman that actually gets to take a vacation?  We are.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:20):**  And, but here's the thing.  The reason for that is because we have me and my brother.  If it was just me and I had just robots, that it's not, it depends what your production  
**[0:18:31-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:31):**  goals are.  If you want to be at like the production levels on that and you're one guy, robots can still  really tie you down.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:40):**  The nice thing about having me and my brother is this whole farm can be a one man show for  like a whole week if it had to be.  And so we don't have to hire anybody.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:18:49):**  But if you were one guy and you had just robots or just parlor, it's probably easier to find  people to milk your cows than it is to run your robots.  If you're a one man guy and you got to leave for a week.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:02):**  But the automated feeding that we have makes that possible.  The automated manure scrapers make that possible.  But yeah, they definitely allow us to have a life.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:10):**  And well, back to my original point though, was, you know, our gamble for this was if  we screw this up and something happens, we lose the farm to be perfectly honest.  And so but we decided, I mean, we were at such a point where, you know, I had back in  
**[0:19:24-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:24):**  2018, I had cancer, and I'm fully convinced that was because I was working myself to death.  I mean, it was 16 hour days every day.  So we came to the point where we would rather do this, improve our quality of life, and  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:36):**  risk losing the farm versus keep going the way we are and be stuck that way for the rest  of my life.  Because it was gonna, I mean, it was gonna kill one of us.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:44):**  My dad was 65.  And in a few years that he was in the parlor for a while, but my mom died in 2015.  So between like 2015 and 2019, my dad aged 20 years.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:19:54):**  I mean, it was just it was wearing him out.  So yeah, yeah, yeah, that just the man hours because after my uncle and cousin left that  that was manpower.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, that was manpower that left the farm, but it left a little bit of a void.  So like I said, we decided we would rather do this and risk losing the farm versus keep  going the way we were.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:11):**  And I never regretted that even even when we've had tough days when we're like, what  the heck what the heck we do?  Do we do the right thing?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:18):**  If every day was easy, everybody be doing it, Dan.  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:23):**  So no, that's that's kind of what got us to where we're at.  But we talked about the dynamic between you and your brother because if so I my biggest  fear is getting in a business with any family member.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:36):**  To be honest, can we talk about that?  Like is it pretty good?  You guys have good communication and how do you handle any disagreements or conflict?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:45):**  I think what makes our relationship work is the fact that we are so different.  Don's like inches taller than me.  He's got brown curly hair, glasses, heavy work interests.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:20:57):**  So as as extroverted as I am, is exactly how introverted he is.  So I mean, we are the opposite sides of the spectrum.  So I think that's what that's what makes everything work.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:08):**  I mean, we don't have too many chiefs and not enough just Indians, you know.  And so but are there definitely times when things are more difficult?  Yeah, I think communication like any family farm is probably our biggest thing, because  
**[0:21:21-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:21):**  when you grow up together, you just kind of know each other.  And so you probably don't communicate as much as you should.  And you think you know what the other person's thinking, but you probably don't.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:31):**  But I mean, for the most part, me and Don work together a lot better than me and like  my cousin did.  Now my cousin and I get along great.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:41):**  But working together, me and my and honestly, looking back, you know, we used to me and  my cousin used to get a lot of arguments.  Honestly, it's probably because we're too alike.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:49):**  You know, everything that made me so frustrated about him at times was probably exactly who  I am, you know what I mean?  So we just butt heads all the time.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:21:59):**  But fortunately, you know, the things I'm more fast paced, go, go, go.  And you know, like a guy like Don, he's very speed is not a virtue.  And so if I need something that is just somebody that's going to do something and just be task  
**[0:22:12-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:12):**  oriented, get it done, not get distracted, he's the guy.  So like the overall like 30,000 foot big picture management stuff is what I'm good at the in  the trenches.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:22):**  Dirty work is what Don's really good at.  And you know, he doesn't look up and think I wish I could do a bend.  And I don't look over at Don and think, Oh, I wish I had his job.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:31):**  You know, we each do a really good job staying focused on what we know we're good at.  And I think that's what makes our makes our partnership work.  Teamwork makes the dream work.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah.  And I mean, don't get me wrong, there's still definitely times where it's like, what the  heck are you doing?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:45):**  And then there's, you know, he has that towards me as well.  So but that's even without family, though.  Like, right, right.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:52):**  Yeah.  So, so yeah, no, I mean, overall has challenges, but it's, it's, it's been really good.  It really has.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:22:59):**  You know, I think one way to avoid, you know, one way to avoid a disagreement or disappointment  is to not have expectations, but to have agreements.  You know, like, like, like to talk about that school that shall not be named position agreements  
**[0:23:15-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:23:15):**  for I'm sorry, Dan, that's ranching for profit.  We just try not to say that all the time on the podcast.  Yeah, that's for Dallas Dallas, send me the check, like, base getting a little bit low.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:23:30):**  Yeah, they talk about, you know, position agreements and working on the business and  working in the business.  It sounds like you do a lot of the working on the business and their strategic planning.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:23:40):**  And you're your brother kind of and you guys have, you know, fairly well defined roles  and agreements on who's going to take care of what and whose authority is is final in  which situation as long as there's good, good communication and respect.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:23:54):**  You know, that's the that's the foundation of a good working relationship.  And I think when things aren't going well, it's because I had expectations that he didn't  even know I was going to do you know what I mean?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:05):**  And then I get mad because you didn't meet those.  I didn't even tell him I was holding him.  So that's on me.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:10):**  Right.  And you had and you have this conversation in your head, right?  You have this fight with them in your head.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:15):**  Because he didn't meet your expectation that you thought he should.  Yeah.  And you're not going to do that.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:20):**  No, I said that on the daily.  The conversation I'm saying in my head and it's usually always worst case scenario and  never has to do with that.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:26):**  But it usually is something you made up and you're not communicating.  Yeah, it's your own fault.  Yep.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:32):**  Yep.  It's your own fault.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:36):**  Huh.  So you mentioned earlier you wanted to circle back and maybe talk about your barns, your  old stanchion barn, your freestyle and the parlor.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:45):**  Sure.  So, so how does all that develop and how are you milking your cows now?  Are you milking your cow?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:51):**  They're milked with robots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:24:54):**  I mean, you guys, I can tell our listeners, got to go look at my TikToks or if you really  want on this podcast here, I'm just on a tablet.  I can pick you up and show you.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:02):**  We can go out there and I can show you some of that stuff if you want.  It's up to you.  But basically the way this all happened.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:08):**  Sorry, it looked like you're going to say something.  Well, you know, we had been recording.  We're just recording audio.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:15):**  We had been doing recording the audio on my console and the video, but we quit doing that  because you know, it's, I just, I'm lazy.  I'm lazy and I really didn't want to take the time to put all the video on YouTube.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:27):**  Honestly, we just kind of quit doing it.  Forget I said anything.  So no, the way this all transpired, gosh, I don't even know.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:36):**  I've seen pictures of the old barn that was here, but you guys know what the picturesque,  you know, straw hat overalls guy with a pitchfork in front of his barn looks like, you know,  that's my grandma.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:48):**  She milked, I think the most she milked at one time by hand was 17 cows, I think is what  she said.  So they built 17 cows by hand.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:25:57):**  That was just an old barn, wooden stalls.  They just, cows just kind of were tied in, stood there, whatever.  You know, they went out to a pasture in the summer and in the winter they put hay away.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:08):**  Same concept we do today.  And when they moved to this farm, that barn in the seventies was basically just dilapidated.  And what I, this is a different topic, but what I'm envious about in 1971 when they built  
**[0:26:23-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:23):**  the barn at the time was the Stanson barn.  We retrofitted a parlor in 2000.  But 1971 when they built that barn, it wasn't a contractor.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:32):**  It wasn't an engineer or some firm.  It was the whole neighborhood.  I mean, I think there was like 12 neighbors all around this area that built this barn.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:41):**  And then guess what they did after this barn?  They built the other neighbor's barn.  Then they built the other neighbor's barn.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:45):**  That is such a concept that is so foreign to millennials or Gen Z.  That's a whole nother conversation.  But that barn was built in 1971 and that was what we call a Stanson barn.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:26:56):**  So it was, it was a 48 cow Stanson barn.  So there's 24 cows that would stand on either side.  And when it was first put in, that's all it was.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:03):**  It was just, Stansons is just a term.  There was a stall there.  It's a head gate.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:06):**  You can lock them in, right?  You can lock them in.  They can lay down, they can stand up.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:10):**  So that's basically where they were in the winter.  And then I have to ask my grandma, my understanding is they would throw small square bales down  from the hay mow and they stay in that barn all winter.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:25):**  And they would milk a cow.  And I just did a TikTok about this here last week.  They just had milker buckets.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:29):**  You hang this bucket from the cow, it goes in the bucket.  You carry that bucket over to the tank.  And actually I take that back.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:34):**  When it first got started, it was, it was a 10 gallon milker buckets.  They had like four or five, there might've been more now like 10, 10 gallon pails, like  the old milk pails.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:44):**  And Bob Helmer was our milk hauler.  He started at our farm when he was 14 and he retired, I think when he was 79 or 80.  And he did that his whole life.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:27:54):**  He was a little scrawny 14 year old lifting these 80 pound milk buckets onto a straight  truck trailer.  And he'd drive all the way down like 40 or 30 miles away.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:06):**  So that's how we got started.  And then it was a massive deal in the seventies when we had our new barn, you know, 71, the  new barn, they put in a pipeline.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:15):**  So you just carried a milking unit to each cow and you just plugged in the milker unit  in the pipeline and holy crap, this milk goes from the cow into the pipeline, right into  the tank.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:24):**  I mean, what an innovation that was in 1971.  And that's crazy to think that that was you, if you had a pipeline and a tall silo that  unloaded itself automatically, you had the world by the tail of the dairy industry.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:37):**  Well, that was only 50 years ago.  Isn't that, isn't that what's wild?  I mean, in 71, 50 years ago, like I said, you had a pipeline, a silo with an unloader,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:45):**  and you had a gutter cleaner in your barn that took all the manure out of your barn.  How does it get any better?  And so they did that, gosh, from 71 till 96.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:28:58):**  And I think in 1995, or 94, we started working with the nutritionist, basically a dietitian  for cows.  And he wanted to get us on TMR, total mixed reaction.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:09):**  So like I said, from 71 to 94, it was just throw hay in front of them, put some grain  on top of it.  Here you go, girls.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:16):**  And in 94, David Weber wanted us to get on TMR.  So Pete, my dad and my uncle said, all right, we're going to do it.  They bought a mixer, they pulled a mixer next to the door, they fill up a wheelbarrow.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:27):**  And at the time, in like 94, they were, so again, it was a 48-cow stanchion barn, right?  So half of them would be outside, half of them would be inside.  The half outside, they could just dump it right in the bunk.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:39):**  But the half that were inside, they did it all by hand, wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow, full  of TMR.  And they saw the cows go up on milk just from having a better diet, a more consistent diet.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:48):**  It wasn't, because when you just put hay and grain on top of it, they pushed the hay aside,  I'm going after this grain.  So what we noticed by giving them a TMR, we just had healthier cows, better components,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:29:57):**  they gained some milk because of that.  But here's the other problem, in the early 90s, and what led to the freestyle barn in  96, was through the winter months that that half of the herd that had to go outside and  
**[0:30:09-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:09):**  eat while the other half of the herd was getting milked, on those cold winter days, they kept  getting frostbite on their teats.  I mean, they had to sell like a dozen cows one winter.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:20):**  Yeah, you can't have that in the dairy industry.  They fall off, like ears?  Yeah, you'd get short ears too.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:27):**  But we didn't have the teat depths and the emollients back then to protect the teats  from freezing.  And I don't think they even, back then, they didn't really have, when the milker came off,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:38):**  I don't know if they really even had much of a teat barrier to prevent mass sinus or  any infection, but they just kept having frostbite and teats.  They kept having sick cows because the cold had them go eat outside.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:47):**  Because again, in Iowa, cows have to be indoors.  Beef cows, they're not as indoors as a dairy cow, but they're not actively lactating, so  it's not the end of the world for them.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:30:57):**  They can put more energy.  They're on a lower energy budget.  Yeah, they can put more energy into being fat and having a thick coat.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:05):**  So that's what really led them in 96.  We were like one of the first freestylers, we weren't the first freestyle barn in the  state, but we were one of the first in the area.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:12):**  We wanted to get our cows inside in a more comfortable area.  So we built this freestyle barn where you could drive the tractor through to feed them.  Holy cow, what an improvement that was.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:22):**  We're wheel bearing all the feed in.  The cows stay in there and they come out to get milked and they go back in the barn.  They had sand bedding.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:30):**  So that sand comes right out of the river in the Mississippi is where it used to come  from.  Now it actually comes from a mine up in Clayton County.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:36):**  That mine, that sand goes to fracking.  This is the reject sand that's too big for fracking.  And by big, it's still microscopic.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:45):**  But so we get that, so it's bone dry.  It's just like being on a beach out in Jamaica.  It's that white beach sand is what it looks like.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:31:52):**  And cows absolutely went nuts over the sand.  They get feed brought to them.  So that freestyle barn was a massive improvement in cow comfort and farmer comfort.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:01):**  So that was a huge change in 96.  So 96, they milked 100 cows, 80 to 100.  They bring one half of the barn out, milk them, put them back in, bring the other half  
**[0:32:11-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:11):**  out into the stanchion barn, milk them, put them back down in the freestyle barn.  And then parlors kind of started hitting the scene in the late 90s, early 2000s.  So a stanchion barn, you carry the milker to each individual cow.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:25):**  You bend over, you put it on, and then you wait.  You would do like six of them at a time.  It was a knee and back killer.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:30):**  The thing about a parlor is now you step down into a pit and the cows come to you.  And so you're standing at eye level putting you, putting milkers on.  And the cows got so well trained, the minute you let them out and you open the gate, income,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:43):**  we had eight cows on each side, so we can milk 16 at one time instead of only six.  So you open the gate, the cows just file in.  You just clean the other, put the milker on, turn around, do this half, and then those  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:32:53):**  half are done, let them out, do this half, and then this half comes in.  You just kind of went from half to half.  And the cows just pretty much walked in on their own.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:02):**  There's a few.  The last cows in every group we call the I and A group.  The I stands for idiots.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:08):**  You can figure out what the A stands for.  There was always a few you had to bring in.  So but yeah, we did the parlor from 2000 to 2019.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:17):**  In 2019 we put the robots in.  So that's a really condensed version of how everything works.  Right.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:25):**  It's like innovating the flow.  Like if you think the flow, is it really, are we creating rules for ourselves that we  have to go to the cow to milk them and feed them or should the cows come to us?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:33):**  And I think, I even think it's interesting when people talk about like in better environments,  maybe those parlor things that go out in the field, what are they called?  Brian, do you know what I'm talking about?  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:46):**  Global parlors?  Global parlors, yeah.  You know, a couple of weeks ago was the first time I ever heard about one of those.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:33:52):**  And I don't even like, I haven't even wrapped my head around it.  I don't know what one would look like or, you know, like the logistics of that.  It's obviously somebody's got it figured out.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:04):**  Or it wouldn't be a thing.  In Wisconsin, there's an outdoor parlor.  It's a seasonal parlor.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:09):**  I forget the name out there.  They're a massive organic farm.  They have a crazy amount of acres.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:12):**  And in the middle of this whole, they're kind of in the driftless region, so it's not like  you can grow crop 10,000 acres.  But in the middle of this valley, it's just a big open shed.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:27):**  And from like, I don't know what it is, like April to November, they're out there milking.  And then they seasonally cab and stuff.  But what's crazy to me is when my grandpa milked in the barn before we had the TMR,  
**[0:34:40-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:40):**  if he knew cow 45 gave more milk, he'd give her a little extra grain, you know.  And if cow 28 didn't give us much, you're getting a little fat.  We're going to cut your grain back.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:49):**  What's really cool about the robots is it almost mimics my grandpa's concept because  they get a pellet in the robot.  So the higher producing cows in the robot get more pellet.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:34:58):**  The lower producing cows don't get as much pellet.  So we can really fine tune their diets with these robots, which is really cool.  So how do your robots know who the cow is?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:07):**  Do you have EIDs or RFID tags or barcode tags?  RFID is on the collar.  And that collar also measures rumination.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:15):**  So it senses, there's a microphone that senses that muscle movement.  We know how often they're chewing.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:20):**  So I can look on my computer and see how many minutes every cow chewed cud.  And if one cow's minutes drop off, it tells me she's sexy.  She's got mastitis, heat stress.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:30):**  She ate something she shouldn't have or something.  If they're in heat, the rumination drops and obviously their activity goes up.  So I know what breed cows with that too.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:39):**  Yeah.  So the robot keeps track of all their data.  It gives her so many pounds.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:43):**  And also too, it gives her so much pellets for how many days in milk she is.  Because they peak, you know, like, I don't, what is the peak?  Like 40 to 40 to 80 to 90 days, I think is when they peak in milk, something like that.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:35:55):**  They'll get more pellets in and as they get farther away, it just, it just kind of starts  giving them less and less pellets and it won't milk them as often.  So like if a cow has had a hundred days since calving and she's given 150 pounds of milk,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:06):**  it'll milk her four times a day.  But when she gets like close to her dry off, when she's like, you know, six weeks from calving  or eight weeks from calving, they don't want to let her get milked one and a half times  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:15):**  a day.  Because the farther and farther they get away from calving, the less and less benefit there  is to milking them more often.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:22):**  That's so interesting.  I thought gross A-systems were cool.  This is even cooler.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:28):**  Yeah, this is pretty cool.  I'm kind of really enjoying this.  Not that I didn't think I would.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:33):**  So there's a part, you do somatic cell counts, right?  So usually that's an indicator of like sick cows or whatever.  And so has the somatic cell count gone down, which means less white blood cells in the  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:50):**  milk, right?  Am I saying that right?  Right.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:36:53):**  Since you went to robotics, because maybe is it like more sterile or what do you, what  happened with that?  So the reason why milk plants want lower somatic cell and I'll double check on this, but I  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:04):**  think they want it because they can get more cheese and more products out of the milk if  it has lower somatic cell.  Components or something like that, right?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah.  Okay.  So the lower your somatic is, typically the higher you can push your butter, fat and protein  
**[0:37:16-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:16):**  levels.  But we were always, before robots were always like probably 130 to 180.  What kind of sucked was the first year we had robots, we were like 250 to 300.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:29):**  And that made me a little paranoid, but it was a bit of a shift getting cows used to  the robots.  It was kind of a whole diet change.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:36):**  So when we changed their diets, it kind of messed up their immune system.  It wasn't much of an environment change because they were in the same barn.  We just added onto it.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:44):**  But we didn't, what we really found out was the way the robots swing in and clean the  teeth with two brushes.  We found out we weren't getting the brushes dry enough.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:37:57):**  And so the teeth were too wet when the liner went to attach.  And so that was, bacteria love moisture.  So we just had too much moisture on the teeth.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:38:07):**  So we turned off the brush washing in the middle of prep time.  In between cows, they still get washed.  We turned that off and our somatic cut in half overnight.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:38:17):**  So our last about eight month average here is 150 to 180.  So right where I want to be.  So I wouldn't say it went down since we had the parlor, but we get premiums if we just  
**[0:38:29-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:38:29):**  stay under 200.  So yeah, I don't get, some co-ops, they give you more of a premium, the lower and lower  you get.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:38:37):**  Our co-op, it's just 200,000 standard and you're good to go.  I'm glad you brought up co-op because I've been kind of wanting to ask you who your customer  is, who you sell to, or how you market, or if there's a way that somebody outlistens  
**[0:38:53-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:38:53):**  this podcast can go to a store and pick up a carton and know that it came from your farm.  So that is probably one of the biggest misconceptions.  People think if you don't go buy milk on the shelf that has Dan Ventaker's name on it,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:09):**  you're not supporting family farms.  I think if you buy great value milk or if you buy fairway, I don't know if you guys  have fairways out there, it's a popular grocery store around here.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:19):**  You're not supporting family farms.  That's actually not true.  So our co-op is Prairie Farms.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:24):**  They're pretty big.  They're based in Illinois.  I know they reach Texas, Missouri.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:30):**  They're like Illinois, Indiana.  I think I've seen Prairie Farms labeled milk in the stores right around here.  Prairie Farms average herd size is like 150 cows.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:42):**  So their average farm is pretty small.  So if you buy anything Prairie Farms, typically you're supporting a smaller farm.  Now, if you buy anything great value, typically great value milk is going to come from those  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:39:55):**  2000, 3000, 4000 cow farms.  That doesn't mean those cows are mistreated.  Those are just bigger farms.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:01):**  But you can only get great value milk at Walmart and I don't go there anymore.  Yeah, I hate Walmart with a burning passion.  The other thing too, like A&E milk is here in Iowa.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:13):**  I don't know if you have A&E, Anderson Erickson.  I don't like the milk.  But anyways, they get all of their milk from two farms and one of them is that 10,000 cow  
**[0:40:23-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:23):**  farm and another one's like a 12,000 cow farm.  So that's kind of like, I hate to talk out about two sides of my mouth, right?  Because all farms, 99% of farms care for their cows.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:36):**  We're all in this together.  Yeah.  We're all dairy farmers.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:40):**  But I just, I like the idea of supporting a Prairie Farms type milk versus A&E type.  I don't know, but they all see people.  Yeah, Brian and I are kind of local force.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:51):**  Like we love supporting our local community.  So like that's our big thing.  And I don't know.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:40:59):**  I don't think we have an opinion on where other people should drink that way.  But I just think you should definitely know what you're buying.  Look, participating in the current system as it is does not make you guilty of creating  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:14):**  it as long as you wish.  Exactly.  And work to change it and to change your patterns.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:20):**  Yeah.  Like in Prairie Farms, isn't any more expensive than great value.  People think, you know, well, I can't afford that.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:26):**  Like if it was 100% like the organic grass fed full GMO, that stuff, a lot of people  just can't afford.  The raw grass fed milk that I like to drink and raw grass fed cream.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:39):**  Have you seen Napoleon Dynamite?  Oh yeah.  And you know, did you ever do milk judging?  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:46):**  Did you do that?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:49):**  That's really a thing.  That's a real thing.  I thought that was a joke for the movie.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:53):**  No, no way, man.  My brother.  Can you tell us the difference?  
**[0:41:58-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:41:58):**  Cause I can't, but that's because I don't drink a lot of milk.  My brother actually went to nationals for dairy judging, for tasting.  Don could identify blindfolded like 16 different kinds of cheeses.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:42:12):**  And you had to drink like 12 different samples of milk.  And one of them, or I'm trying to think, one of them did have an onion flavor because it  meant something happened to the milk.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:42:21):**  But like basically the reason that came about was back in like the seventies and eighties,  if milk had like a bitter taste, it means the pipeline didn't get washed correctly.  If it had like a sour taste, it meant the water didn't get hot enough.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:42:33):**  So there's still milk residue in the pipeline.  Like, so the bitter taste meant you didn't get all the detergent out of your pipeline.  There's still soap in your pipeline.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:42:41):**  I'm trying to think of all the other milk.  I'm trying to think of all the other, I think there was like 12 different milk samples and  based on how you pasteurize it too, right?  
**[0:42:53-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:42:53):**  Like raw versus pasteurized, you can tell the difference.  UHT milk has its own own distinct taste that if you, we will buy Walmart milk just because  we have three toddlers and they do the grocery pick.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:08):**  They do the grocery drop off where you sit in your car and they just bring it to you.  So that is one of our guilty admissions that sometimes we have to do the Walmart drop off.  But like even between the Walmart milk or the fairway milk, and I don't know where fairway  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:21):**  even gets their milk from massive difference.  I think the Walmart milk tastes terrible.  I drink everything out of the bulk tank.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:26):**  I only drink the store milk when I'm out of my milk and I don't want to come down and  get one.  But my milk has a totally different taste.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:33):**  It's not, I don't know if it's even the pasteurization.  I think it's the homogenization that really changes the taste.  So interesting.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:40):**  Yeah, I forgot where I was going with that.  Well I just kept seeing the Napoleon 9 scene in my head and I was like, I have to ask this  question as ridiculous as it sounds, but that's so interesting.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:43:53):**  And what you feed the cows can affect the taste, not dramatically.  I know of a co-op or a farm around here that they sell their own milk.  It's Hanson dairy, I think is their name.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:04):**  And they said one of the things that took the longest was just fine tuning their diet  for the most palatable milk.  And anybody that's had my milk, I've given it to my buddies or people that will stop  
**[0:44:14-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:14):**  by or, you know, I try not to give it to tourists just because it can be rich and kind of, you  know, if you're not used to it.  If you're not used to raw milk, it can hit you kind of hard.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:24):**  Yeah.  But anybody that's had my milk absolutely just loves it.  So I'm not, I don't think what you feed the cows has a massive difference on what the  
**[0:44:33-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:33):**  milk tastes like, but it can definitely have some impact, especially if they dig it into  an onion patch.  I'm not getting you, you would absolutely taste it in the milk.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:43):**  Anecdotally so in the last couple of years of my journey into being a local vore and  trying to source as much food locally as I can, we've tried milk from a couple of different  grass fed dairies around.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:44:57):**  And there's one, I'm not going to mention any names, but they have a closed herd that's  made up of, I mean, some Jersey and some Holstein with some other dual purpose crossed in there.  And they've been breeding for, I think almost 30 years.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:45:15):**  And they free, you know, they do raw on-farm sales, but they sell frozen, which I'm not  a huge fan of.  But it has, it tastes like the grass that's growing on their farm.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:45:29):**  That that's, I mean, it tastes to me, it tastes like what the cows eat.  I mean, there's a, there's a local producer around here.  I hope he doesn't listen to the podcast, but he feeds his cows a lot of Johnson grass hay  
**[0:45:41-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:45:41):**  and he sells grass fed beef.  And when I eat, yeah, and it tastes like it kind of tastes like Johnson grass.  If you're not familiar with it, it's like, it's a, it's an ugly cousin of sorghum Sudan  
**[0:45:53-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:45:53):**  and it's an invasive cousin of sorghum Sudan.  That's a, that's annual anerizomenos.  And it's, it's not bad cow feed when it's part of a really diverse ration.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:07):**  Cause I mean, it's super high in sugars.  It's super high in sugars, but it shouldn't, you shouldn't finish on it and it shouldn't  be primary diet is, is my point.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:19):**  But you know, I, as far as you know, the, the more grass fed, there is go that I'm familiar  with each, each one of them has its own distinct taste.  The three around me has its own distinct taste.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:31):**  And like when we used to drink great value milk, even great value, whole milk, just tastes,  it just tastes watery.  And I looks not supposed to be watery.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:41):**  It's supposed to be food.  Well, I think some of that is due to the homogenization, honestly.  I think, I think that plays a big role in breaking those fat particles down and just  
**[0:46:51-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:51):**  making it because people, people don't like to see that cream separated.  It's an eye sole, but there's nothing wrong with it.  It just doesn't look right.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:46:58):**  And so, you know, they homogenize it so everything stays in suspension.  But the other reason they homogenize it is it's easier to make ice cream.  I talked to a small plant down in Missouri College Farm.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:47:10):**  They sell their own milk.  And if they don't homogenize it, it is, if they want to put like flavors in the ice cream,  chocolate or strawberry, it's impossible to get, you'll get one bite.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:47:21):**  That's no strawberry.  And then you'll just get nothing but strawberry concentrate.  You can't, they can't get it mixed in there.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:47:28):**  So like homogenization is necessary for some aspects.  But I think too, some diets in some cows can have more effects on what their milk tastes  like based off their diet than other cows.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:47:41):**  So like, trying to think how to explain this.  It depends on, you know, your rumen pH, what your rumen micro load is like.  Like if you took my diet and fed it to a different herd, that herd's milk could taste it.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:47:57):**  It just depends on what...  And that herd could fall on its face too.  Right, right.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:02):**  So yeah, it's a whole other animal feed.  We're not feeding cows here.  We're feeding microbes.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:09):**  Exactly.  You know, so yeah.  Not feeding the cow, got to feed the rumen because the rumen feeds the cow.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:17):**  And you know, I at least have some basic understanding of how that works with a beef cow.  But like how that works with the dairy cow is...  So much more intensive.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:28):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, the rumen is the, that's the furnace that really fuels any kind of milk  
**[0:48:36-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:36):**  production.  So my, and I talk about this a lot in my TikToks, my grandpa, if they hit 70 pounds of milk  per cow as a herd average, holy crap.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:46):**  I mean, they were flying.  Our genetics have certainly improved.  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:48:52):**  But being that we don't do a lot of embryo transfer, my genetic advancement isn't as  fast as some other herds, but our herd average today is 95 pounds.  I have some cows peaking at like 205 pounds.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:49:05):**  Again, obviously there's some genetics involved, but the only thing we've done is figure out  how to really, really fine tune that rumen to feed those microbes, to meet the energy  demands of that cow.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:49:17):**  Every, I mean, many, many cows have the potential to get a lot of milk.  For decades, we just weren't meeting that potential with their diet.  And so cow comfort, the diet, and a lot of those things are what's pushed production  
**[0:49:29-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:49:29):**  up to the levels they're at.  And what's cool about our herd is we do a lot of genomic testing.  So we have a really good idea of where every genetic aspect of our cows are.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:49:38):**  So when we do genomic tests through, they tell us our cows are like six to seven pounds  higher than where our genetics even say we should be.  So to me, that's a really, really good sign that our diet, our cow welfare is this top  
**[0:49:54-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:49:54):**  notch.  Yeah, because our genetics tell us we should be lower, but we're not.  So I'm kind of curious, you mentioned earlier that your robots will feed a little bit different  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:07):**  based on milk yield.  Is every, are all your cows getting the same mix?  Or will they get maybe…  
**[0:50:14-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:14):**  Correct, so they eat out, and anybody can look at my TikToks to see where they eat at,  but they eat in the freestyle bar and through a headlock, just through a, it's called  a stanchion, you know, they can go in and out whenever they want.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:25):**  That's where the TMR is.  With robots, this is a whole other can of worms, it's actually called a PMR, partially  mixed reaction.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:31):**  Because when you don't have robots, it's a total mixed reaction because all of the  energy is coming at the feed you drop in front of them.  With robots, about 90% of their diet is in the feed you drop in front of them.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:46):**  The other like 8 to 10% is over at the robot.  So in the robot, they're all getting either A, a corn gluten pellet, or B, it's like  a, it looks like frosted flakes, it's steam flaked corn, roasted soybeans, soy whole pellets.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:50:58):**  And that's while they're being milked, right?  So they get 50-50 of both of those feeds.  It's not always 50-50.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:05):**  If it's a higher producer, it's more of one feed type, and if they're a lower producer,  it's more of the other feed type.  So it depends on how much milk they're getting.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:13):**  That's good because it motivates them to want to use the robot, right?  Instead of scaring away from it or walking at it.  Right.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:20):**  And I've had some, you know, anti-ag people say, well, they're not going to the robot  because they like it, you're starving them.  They're like, we're not starving them.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:26):**  They could live just fine without the robot.  They one, they really, really liked that food.  But if they didn't go to the robot, you know, that corn gluten, it is energy.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:35):**  So they would drop on milk a little bit.  But they also, they don't have to go to the robot.  They might go in there because they like those pellets.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:43):**  It's a reward.  It's a reward based training.  You make it a pleasant experience.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:49):**  You give them a reward.  Yeah.  And it's a relief to get milked.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:53):**  Like let's just like.  It is.  I've seen, I've seen one of these, what's his name?  
**[0:51:59-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:51:59):**  Militant soy boy is his name on TikTok.  He had this, it's a whole other thing too.  He had this whole thing about how dairy farmers say cows have to be milked, but they'll be  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:10):**  in pain.  And then goes to throw dairy farmers under the bus.  Like how convenient that we created a problem.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:15):**  And then we also have the solution.  Cows aren't inherently in, like we don't, we don't milk cows because they're in pain.  We milk cows because milk is a good product and milk is good for people and cows, cows  
**[0:52:27-0:52:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:27):**  cooperate and we can get a good product.  That's why we milk cows.  Now is it painful if they don't get milked and you'll see a lot of women that'll kind  
**[0:52:35-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:35):**  of, Oh my God, when I was breastfeeding, if I didn't get milked, it was painful.  That's a dangerous correlation to start saying people are just like cows.  I mean, you guys have seen cows udders.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:44):**  They have very strong ligaments running through the udder.  Oh absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:49-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:52:49):**  And when you milk 205 pounds, when her udder is at 205 pounds, she gets milked four times  a day, but she has 50 to 60 pounds of milk in her udder at one moment.  So a cow that's giving 80 pounds a day, that's getting close to dry off at any given time,  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:07):**  she has 20 pounds of udder.  Is it painful if she doesn't get milked that day?  No, it's not.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:12):**  Is it, is it maybe kind of feel like, Oh, I got to pee a little bit.  Maybe there's definitely a tightness.  But is it painful?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:20):**  No.  Now someone will say, well, I, I, I said that at TikTok once and I was amazed at how many  people got ticked off because they said, well, don't get mastitis.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:28):**  Mastitis is painful.  Not milking a cow doesn't cause mastitis.  Can it increase their risk?  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:35):**  Yes.  Because milk might be running out of the teat and that could be an opportunity for bacteria  to get in there.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:41):**  But we throw a teat sealant in the sphincter.  It's just a, you could, I mean, the salesman who sells the stuff.  He squirts it in his mouth and just, it's just a keratin something, something.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:53:52):**  But it's, we'll throw that in there just so milk doesn't run out.  Sorry, my robot is calling me.  I'm just erasing the alarm here.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:02):**  What's it telling you?  It's telling me the vector is out of halins.  So I'm just going to text my brother and tell him to go fix that.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:09):**  Problem solved.  Back, back to the mastitis thing.  Yeah, I mean, not milking a cow doesn't automatically equal mastitis and doesn't automatically equal  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:19):**  taint.  Yeah, it's a bacterial thing.  It's not a milking thing.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:23):**  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:26):**  Yeah.  Yep.  So what did you say the robot was out of?  
**[0:54:30-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:30):**  I didn't quite catch that.  Yup, our vector is our automated feeding.  I just texted my old man.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:38):**  So we feed corn silage, hay silage, cottonseed, ground corn, wheat starch.  We have straw, we have a dry cow corn silage, some rye and some corn stalks that all get  fed in the kitchen.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:50):**  The kitchen is what supplies the mixer automatically.  And it just called me and said, I am out of halins.  Come give me some more.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:54:59):**  So the kitchen is just like it's a building with just different places that you put the  ingredients.  It's a commodity shed.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:07):**  And then a crane comes and picks them up and puts them in the robot, right?  And that's all automated.  And then the mixer mixes it and sends it out to the barn.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:15):**  That's just so wild.  He's got a teeth milk.  Iowa dairy farmer on TikTok.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:21):**  It's probably all over the place, right?  Yeah.  The vector ones are pretty popular.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:27):**  The one vector one I did, we had like 650,000 views.  The other one had like 500,000 views.  The vector is a real, it's an attention grabber.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:36):**  Yeah.  Just going out, it's probably a little bit more eye catching than just a couple of pictures  of my Longhorns.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:42):**  Longhorns are pretty cool too.  Yeah, Longhorns definitely wouldn't cooperate with a whole stanchion headgate thing to get  milked every day.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:55:51):**  I don't see that working too well.  So I don't want to control your podcast or anything here, but I wanted to ask you, you  and I were kind of talking when we first kind of started talking about coming on the podcast  
**[0:56:03-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:56:03):**  about regenerative, I can't say that, regenerative agriculture.  And I follow like Sister's Cattle Co on TikTok.  They're a very popular account for regenerative ag.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:56:18):**  I guess I'm kind of interested in you just kind of giving me your take on that and where  that fits in our agricultural industry as a whole.  When we look at these big feed lots, I mean, dairies like mine, I like to think, even though  
**[0:56:33-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:56:33):**  I'm probably never going to look like what Hobbs looks like up there in Oregon, I just  don't know if I can ever get to that farm.  But I like to think that I can still fulfill what his goal is and what our goal is as stewards  
**[0:56:46-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:56:46):**  of soil health, organic matter, taking care of the environment.  So the way I, if you tell me that I can't do it, I'm not going to be offended.  I'm fully open to any criticism, but I'd be curious to know like, what's your big picture  
**[0:57:00-0:57:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:57:00):**  for the whole agricultural industry?  And then like me personally, do you think a dairy like mine operating, can you and I  get to the same place, even though my practices might not be a high density ruminant grazing  
**[0:57:14-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:57:14):**  operation?  Well, you know, I have thought about this quite a bit, Dan.  And you know, I think about the six principles of soil health.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:57:26):**  And to me, those are kind of what, more or less define what a regenerative operation  is.  And one of them, you know, minimize soil disturbance, living route 24-7-365.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:57:39):**  But kind of the big one is you have to return animals to the land, you know, use the animals  directly to add the fertility back to the soil, instead of using machinery to haul that.  So I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, and like I said earlier, you know, participating  
**[0:57:59-0:58:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:57:59):**  in the current system doesn't make us guilty of creating it.  You know, as long as we realize that there are other ways to do business, and there may  possibly be a better way to do business, and we need to dedicate ourselves to keep learning,  
**[0:58:13-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:58:13):**  learning about other practices and keep an open mind.  So what I would say to that, Dan, is the less outside energy, the less inputs that you're  using, and fuel is one of those categories.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:58:31):**  And you could even put technology in one of those categories.  I'm starting to put higher forms of technology in one of those categories of, you know, extreme  external input.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:58:41):**  Because like, we're recording this, it's the first of June, this episode is going to  come out.  Right now I have you scheduled for the 5th of July.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:58:53):**  Microprocessor shortages.  Like every car manufacturer in the world, except Toyota, has had to slow down manufacturing  or stop some models completely because microchips.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:59:07):**  Samsung just announced two days ago they're not coming out with a new flagship phone this  year because microchip shortage.  So what I'm getting at is all this technology sits kind of on a pyramid of almost unsustainable  
**[0:59:27-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:59:27):**  input energy.  And at some point, there's going to be a big reset, right?  You know, energy is going to get really expensive.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:59:38):**  So what happens to your operation?  What does your operation look like when you woke up tomorrow, diesel fuel was $6?  What would it look like if diesel fuel was $12?  
**[0:59:51-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=0:59:51):**  What would it look like if one of your robots broke and it was a critical part and you called  the factory and they said, maybe six weeks if you're lucky?  Right.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:03):**  No, that's a fair question.  And again, I want you to know anything's on the table here.  I do not get offended easily as long as we're respectful.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:10):**  I want to make that perfectly clear.  Yeah, we're good.  We're good.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:13):**  No, but no, the beautiful thing.  So yeah, you brought up a good thing and a bad thing that I'm facing.  The good thing about the robots is my diesel bill compared to two years ago is half of  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:23):**  what it used to be.  That's because of the daily mixing of feed.  Now the catch is I need diesel fuel to harness crops, right?  
**[1:00:29-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:29):**  To run the chopper, to run the mowers, run those kinds of things.  So there's a catch 22 there.  But in terms of technology, that completely floors me about the microchips and the cars  
**[1:00:40-1:00:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:40):**  and the smartphones.  And it has frightened me a little bit.  Like right now, the short term, Lely has so many parts on hand that their back stock of  
**[1:00:49-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:49):**  parts is unreal.  Now, if that were to run out and they could replace it, I don't have a good answer to  be perfectly honest with you.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:00:56):**  Now, if I lost power, I had backup generators, but now we're back on the diesel thing.  But yeah, I don't have a great answer in terms of if this part or that part went out.  There's some parts that it's one little valve that Lely makes specifically for this part  
**[1:01:12-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:01:12):**  in the robot arm that I cannot run this robot without it.  And if I can't get that, it's not going to milk cows.  So I think Lely more so than maybe even Samsung in terms of a smartphone is more of an essential  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:01:25):**  business.  You know, we went through the COVID, there was essential and not essential.  That's a whole other disagreement.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:01:30):**  I would assume Lely knows that they have to have parts immediately.  Right.  So, yeah, again, I don't have a really clear answer for you on that and what some of that  
**[1:01:40-1:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:01:40):**  would look like.  But that's definitely a chink in our armor that if certain seven-cent parts can't be  made, I'm screwed.  
**[1:01:48-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:01:48):**  I'll fully admit that.  I think that part of being a good business owner is being willing to look at those weak  links and address them with strategic planning down the line.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:01):**  Right.  I mean, and our dealer is 11 miles away and they have 15 pieces of every single part we  could ever need.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:10):**  So I mean, in the short term, we're fine.  And there's been times like the liner that actually the inflation that milks the teeth.  Lely didn't have a back order of those.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:19):**  Lely has a good network where every single dealer had like eight months worth of liners  so that, you know, they never fell short.  So I mean, they have precautions in place if they were to face a back order.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:30):**  Like, you know, I don't think these car manufacturers were expecting a back order of microchips.  So they didn't have any microchips.  Well, exactly.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:37):**  And a lot of big businesses, you have someone who's actually in charge of inventory.  And the goal is to never have more inventory than you need because that's a cash flow,  like negative on their loss.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:48):**  Right.  Yep.  Inventory bought with cash is sitting doesn't make you money.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:02:54):**  But I said all of them but Toyota and I actually watched a pretty cool YouTube video on this  a couple nights ago.  Toyota, the reason everybody else is screwed right now is because they adopted only the  
**[1:03:07-1:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:07):**  good parts of Toyota's system that they saw.  They didn't see the genius behind Toyota's just in time manufacturing system.  So you have all these global supply chains that are built on, you know, components and  
**[1:03:19-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:19):**  raw materials arriving exactly when they are needed.  And COVID has disrupted that there's, you know, massive freight disruptions.  I think it, you know, there's a three week delay going into the Port of Los Angeles or  
**[1:03:30-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:30):**  Port of Long Beach right now for any container ship.  There's four to five loads of freight for every truck on the road right now backed up.  And that's not getting any better.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:42):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, for us with robots, I have a few chinks.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:47):**  But like even like those bigger dairies, you look at stuff like those big rotary parlors,  they take these special bearings that roll around on that track.  There's some farms if you can't get the right oil or the right metal for that bearing or  
**[1:03:59-1:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:03:59):**  the right steel for this part of that part, they're screwed too.  You know, every dairy, more so than like yourself, dairies are probably one of the more, and  obviously you could say pork too, but pigs really just, especially I know, and I know  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:15):**  pigs is a whole nother topic in terms of confinement and how those work.  I'm not a pig guy.  But I don't know if they would necessarily face the vulnerability that dairies do because  
**[1:04:23-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:23):**  dairies have so many moving parts that they all have to work together.  And so there's, I mean, we're definitely vulnerable to some of those things you're talking about.  Well, I mean, I wouldn't want to have a 10,000 head hog barn and be looking at $7 corn and  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:39):**  $12 beans.  Yeah, that would be right.  Unless you can grow your own.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:42):**  No kidding.  That's the only way.  I mean, well, it's even worse right now for the feeders, for all the feedlot owners that  
**[1:04:50-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:50):**  are looking at $7 corn and $12 beans and looking at these pens as 1600 pound fats that the  Packers only want to pay $1.20 for.  Yeah.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:04:59):**  And that's where we have the benefit of being like Prairie Farms is they're big, but they  treat us small.  I mean, they're consistently paying us one to two to three dollars more per hundred ready  
**[1:05:09-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:09):**  milk than every other co-op because they control how much milk they bring in.  We have what's called a base program.  So if I go over my base, I don't get paid as much.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:18):**  So I mean, they haven't like basically they're saying like, guys, we can't sell more than  this amount.  Don't bring us more than this about, you know, dairy, dairyman, our own worse enemy when  
**[1:05:25-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:25):**  milk price sucks.  What do we do?  We shit more milk when milk price is good.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:29):**  What do we do?  We shit more milk.  Yeah, that's yeah.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:35):**  But you know, back to your point or, you know, what I asked you about regenerative ag, you  know, like my friend Tom, his name's Tom Lawler.  He works for Indigo Ag.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:44):**  He's focusing a lot on regenerative ag.  And him and I had a big meeting.  He was up here.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:49):**  Oh, geez, I was back in March or April already about the six principles of soil health.  You know, he's huge in all this stuff.  And so I mean, I think I do pick his brain a lot.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:05:58):**  And I think what you guys are talking about is awesome.  And when I'm trying and Tom and I do buttheads very respectfully.  He's my best man at my wedding.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:06):**  I love Tom.  You know, so Tom will come here and he'll say, Dan, let's let's let's take this 40 acres.  Let's put your herd out there.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:13):**  Let's pasture them.  We could do this.  You know, I'll say, well, Tom, what about TMR?  
**[1:06:17-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:17):**  And he'll say, well, we can do this, this, this.  And I got to I got to back up and tell Tom like Tom, you know, with dairy farming here,  you know, for me to pay for this barn to feed my family to feed, you know, we got two full  
**[1:06:29-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:29):**  families on this.  I have to hit this production benchmark.  And if I do what Tom is telling me to do to fully meet all six principles, I can't feed  
**[1:06:40-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:40):**  my family if I do that.  That's the catch 22 with dairy farming and the way this type of dairy operation works.  Because we should the way I kind of told told Tom to is we shipped six and a half million  
**[1:06:50-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:06:50):**  pounds of milk per year off this off these 335 acres.  I shipped six and a half million pounds of milk.  If we were to fully incorporate, you know, the getting all my cows out in the fields,  
**[1:07:03-1:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:03):**  you know, which we could do.  I wouldn't, you know, I'd be lucky to get to three and a half to 4 million pounds of  milk.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:12):**  Because the reason I'm able to ship that is kind of the same reasons I said, but what  my grandpa did earlier, you know, we know exactly what they're eating in that TMR.  It's a very controlled diet.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:20):**  We have a we have a very temperature controlled barn, a comfortable bar, you know, and they  lay down if you give a dairy cow the opportunity to lay down 14 to 15 hours a day, she will  do it not out of exhaustion.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:32):**  Because cows are lazy.  Right, my cows are lazy too, if they don't have to get up and work and eat, they're gonna  lay down.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:38):**  Right.  So like for a dairy cow, if she had to walk around and again, I'm not slandering guys  who have their beef cows on pasture.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:44):**  Like a dairy cow, she had to walk around that pasture all day to get her food, that's less  time she's laying down.  That's more energy she's burning.  
**[1:07:50-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:50):**  The more energy she burns to do those things, the less energy she's gonna put in the milk  production.  So you know, for me paying my bills, I pay my bills selling milk.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:07:57):**  And so the technology is certainly a, you know, it's not cheap.  It's definitely kind of expensive.  Well, I don't need I don't need to do this type of farming to pay just for the technology.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:08:07):**  You know, if you just forget the technology, forget that bill, just to pay for two families,  you know, this kind of the way we raise cows in this freestyle barn.  That's just what it takes to keep to keep all of us fed.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:08:20):**  So I couldn't change you couldn't change with your cow herd that's been bred for 45 years  to succeed under that type of management.  You have a tuned in cow herd that's dialed into your management, how you're feeding.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:08:37):**  You know your cows, you know, their genetics, right, right.  So if you just took your cows and tried to put them out on grass and go convert them  to grass fed dairy, I guarantee you'll fail.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:08:46):**  It won't work.  Right.  And I appreciate you saying that because my friends like top Okay, welcome to death.  
**[1:08:52-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:08:52):**  You know, he if he had his way, he would want my cows out there.  It's not that that can't work because it definitely dairies that grace.  Absolutely.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:01):**  There definitely are.  But I know where where my production standards have to be met to feed to my dad three, basically  three families.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:08):**  Yeah, I can't do that if they're fully fully pasture based.  So go ahead.  Here would be a challenge.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:17):**  How much extra work would be getting five, five different cows that are maybe, you know,  not tuned into what you're doing, but a place to start and start somewhere small.  Just starting to start in a postage stamp and see and just try it.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:34):**  The catch is, is the robot, right?  They got to walk to the robot.  That's the big pickup.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:41):**  So there are parlour herds like again, in Wisconsin, that organic farm, they have that  parlour in the middle of a field.  They can make that work.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:48):**  But like, I'm not throwing them under the bus.  Okay.  But they're like tank averages.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:52):**  55 60 pounds per cow.  That's half of what mine is.  So I can't, I can't financially sustain that.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:09:59):**  Now they have less inputs too.  I was gonna say that, you know, that that's the trade off, you know, right.  You can take a lot lower production out of your cow if your input costs are also much  
**[1:10:11-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:11):**  lower at the same time.  Right.  So here's the catch.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:14):**  Finding that sweet spot is a little tricky, isn't it?  And this is something I'm embarrassed to admit.  My feed mill, when I started in 2015, when I when I started in Honey Creek in 2015, my  
**[1:10:26-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:26):**  milk production per cow was 72 pounds per cow.  And now I'm at, I've peaked at 102.  But right now I'm at 95.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:34):**  My feed bill hasn't changed.  And the reason we got more production is because we just harvested the crops at a better stage.  And we started breeding cows at a little bit better time to capitalize on their peak milk  
**[1:10:47-1:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:47):**  production.  We added, we changed our stalls and our freestyle barns so they got more hours of lying time.  We pushed back feed more often so they could have more access to fresher feed.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:10:57):**  And the vector dumping feed every three hours really helps.  But my feed bill hasn't really changed since 2015.  But I'm shipping 2 million more pounds of milk per year.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:11:07):**  So you know, if I just go back to the 75 pounds I was at, I would have been better off doing  what you're doing, what you're talking about, and just minimizing my feed inputs.  But you know, I'm to the point now where, especially with the technology I have, you  
**[1:11:25-1:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:11:25):**  know, I do have certain bills that still got to be paid, obviously.  But the catch is always that robot.  Is if I get them farther away from the robot, they might not want to come up.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:11:37):**  You know, and that's where dairy's to fully incorporate, you know, dairy herds.  There's obviously some dairy herds, niche dairy herds, smaller, organic, you know, in  the driftless region, you know, where you just can't grow row crops.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:11:52):**  That's something like this is definitely possible.  I think it's great.  But there's a lot of dairy herds like mine.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:11:58):**  I mean, there's, I don't know, there's, what is it, 500,000 robots out there?  I mean, there's a lot of robots.  It's very, and there's some that do graze.  
**[1:12:08-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:08):**  They have what's called a graze way.  So if the cow wants to go outside, this thing says, nope, you're too soon to get milk.  If you go out there, you're not going to come back and get milk.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:15):**  So like their graze way, if they're within so many hours of needing to get milk, it won't  let them outside.  So those things are possible.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:24):**  But I guess, you know, and we're on that is I want to know, do you think, I mean, is it  even possible for me to meet all six principles without getting the cows on the land?  Obviously I got a mechanically all the manure out there.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:38):**  I love what you guys are talking about.  And I think the soil health is so important.  And I get so annoyed on TikTok that there's so many farmers that just mock it.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:47):**  Like, you know, I'm a no-till farmer and there are so many TikTok accounts with these big  row crop guys that just mock no-till guys.  They'll show them pulling like a big chisel plow and a ripper.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:12:57):**  Yeah, we don't need to mention any names of those, of those pro-tillers, you know, those  guys in Illinois that like to see their dirt bear.  Don't need to mention any of those names.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:13:09):**  No, we won't.  But you get my point that I really like what you guys are trying to do.  And I want to get as close to you guys as I can.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:13:15):**  I think the point is context.  Yeah.  That's the first one is you have to realize your context and what works for you and you  
**[1:13:22-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:13:22):**  having to maintain three family units is your biggest context.  I think that you're still moving towards principles that focus on prioritizing soil health.  But I think Brian says some things in previous episodes is like, we don't have to be a hundred  
**[1:13:38-1:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:13:38):**  percent within those six principles.  If we're in 80 percent, then we're more aligned to be.  And you know, working that way.  
**[1:13:47-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:13:47):**  I mean, you know, the two big ones are no monocultures.  For me, the two big ones are no monoculture and animals on the land, because it's not  just it's not just the pee and the poop.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:01):**  It's the microbiome exchange between the cow spit, the different cows spit, you know, as  they're eating different plants and they're tasting different things through the pasture.  There's some microbiome exchange, but also the bacteria exchange between the soil and  
**[1:14:18-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:18):**  the cow.  Sure.  You know, in that saliva.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:23):**  My friends, Josh and Gwen Hoy, they like to say that cow spit grows grass, not rain.  Sure.  And, you know, there's something to that.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:32):**  It's not necessarily the actual amount of moisture in the cows.  It's the microbes and saliva in it.  So having your ruminants back on the land, to me, I think that's pretty key because ruminants  
**[1:14:49-1:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:49):**  are the only way to cycle low quality forage into high quality protein.  I mean, well, they're not the only way.  Sheep do it.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:14:59):**  Well, sheep and goats are ruminants.  Chickens do it.  They're not a ruminant.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:03):**  Pigs do it and they're not a ruminant.  So getting some of that biology back on the land and maybe in your context, it's not cattle.  Maybe it's bringing in, like we were talking earlier, you had a cover crop or rye that  
**[1:15:18-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:18):**  you need to terminate.  Well, maybe instead of terminating that with your cows, maybe you get somebody with some  stockers and bring in like a thousand stockers for two days to just smash it all flat.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:29):**  And then you can go run your cover crop drill through it.  All right.  Let me ask you this.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:33):**  Well, let's say I'm a dairy farmer.  I'm stupid to say.  I'm trying to think of like, again, I really enjoy being challenged.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:44):**  I want you to know that.  As long as somebody is like you guys are seeing my side of the table too.  So if I got to keep my milk cows in the barn because of the robots, because of the corn  
**[1:15:53-1:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:15:53):**  silage, to me, I wouldn't see anything wrong with doing my young side, my heifers, my calves,  my dry cows.  You know, you could put them out on a pasture.  
**[1:16:02-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:02):**  But here's the catch with that though, just where I'm at with that is I don't know if  I would have the acres to do that because that wouldn't, and maybe you can tell me I'm  wrong, but wouldn't that require more acres to pasture some of my young stock or some  
**[1:16:19-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:19):**  of my dry cows?  It's like carrying capacity stocking rates.  You got to match them up.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:23):**  That's what it is.  It doesn't necessarily mean acres.  Right.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:26):**  So if I have three, let's just round it to an even 350.  I have 350 acres and I'm pretty well maxed out.  I need every one of those acres to go to forage or corn grain for the milk cows for our starch  
**[1:16:41-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:41):**  source.  If I can't afford to give up a single acre, can I accomplish the same thing?  Can I keep our heifers, let's say like our heifer farm is six miles away.  
**[1:16:51-1:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:16:51):**  It's at a different farm.  So none of these forages I grow from the milk cows go up there.  So if there's 160 acres up there and 60 of that goes to corn grain.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:01):**  So the other hundred acres, can I, in your mind, can I feed all hundred of those?  I have a hundred heifers up there off 100 heifers and 100 acres basically.  What do you call it?  
**[1:17:13-1:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:13):**  A heifer like a 600 pounder?  They go up there at about five months and they leave there when they're about 20 to  21 months.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:24):**  So they're up there from five months of age to 20 to 21 months of age.  So they're growing from what, 300-400 pounds to 1200-1300 pounds?  Yeah 1200-1300 pounds.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:35):**  So they're going to average probably around 800 pounds.  How many did you say there are?  There's got to be 100 of them up there.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:44):**  I mean yeah.  I don't know where you're at.  I don't know what your forage production is like there in that part of Iowa but that seems  
**[1:17:53-1:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:17:53):**  pretty reasonable.  A hundred of them on 100 acres.  If you can stay in front of them with cover crops and a diverse grazing mix and they're  
**[1:18:04-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:18:04):**  moved pretty frequently, yeah I think 100 acres would be enough.  How would we accomplish that in the winter months in your mind?  Well again, here where I'm at on the plains, my grasses, I have to haul protein in the  
**[1:18:19-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:18:19):**  winter.  There's no way around it.  Even my adapted cows, they still need some protein to get through the winter and the  
**[1:18:26-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:18:26):**  ones that are less adapted, of course they need a whole bunch more.  But as far as winter graze strategy, there's cool season mixes that can be planted.  7, 3, 5, 7, 10-way cool season mixes that can be planted to provide a good forage blend  
**[1:18:43-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:18:43):**  during the winter.  Imagine green cover seed or somebody else.  Your local favorite weird seed dealer might be able to tell you.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:18:53):**  But I mean if we get two foot of snow, there's no access to those crops though, right?  They can shovel through it.  If you challenge them, they'll try to access that.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:03):**  You'd be surprised at what some of these cows will do to get groceries in the weather.  Back in February, we had the polar vortex that everybody was dealing with.  We got a couple inches of snow.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:16):**  No, it wasn't snow, we got about three quarters of an inch of ice one day and it all came  in on a north wind.  I left a lot of stockpiled forage up, a lot of tall grass still out in the pasture, a  
**[1:19:28-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:28):**  lot of stem and seed head and that created shelter on the downwind side where there wasn't  any ice.  Those cows would walk from one pasture, they'd just trot from one end down to the other and  
**[1:19:39-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:39):**  then put their heads down and chase those little bits of green and those little bits  of brown they could get to and not have to work through the ice.  Then when we got six inches of snow, they'd go out there and they'd just dig through the  
**[1:19:51-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:51):**  snow and find something to eat.  I rolled out two bales of alfalfa that they ignored for a week and they were still out  hustling looking for grass.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:19:58):**  Bell grazing also helps too though, right?  If you're building organic matter.  That would be a great strategy.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:06):**  If you're totally covered up and don't trust your cows to be able to find the forage under  a foot of snow to go find them, roll out a bale and make them stand on that bale and  smash that bale into the dirt.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:18):**  And then you're also adding all the nutrients from that bale that they don't eat.  That's feeding your soil too.  You can tell in this area when a guy dumps a round bale out of the field, that part of  
**[1:20:29-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:29):**  the field is black next spring.  It's obvious, it really is.  So let's go back down to the dairy farm.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:36):**  If putting my milking herd on the land isn't an option down here, what's our goal with  the soil?  Is our goal just organic matter?  
**[1:20:48-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:48):**  Is it just microbes?  It's obviously all of it.  I mean, there's several things in the soil.  
**[1:20:53-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:20:53):**  If there's a way I can improve the metrics you want to improve by not putting the cattle  out there, then that changes our conversation, right?  Yeah, I would say it's mimicking nature.  
**[1:21:06-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:06):**  That's the goal.  If you can figure out how to mimic nature, then that's going to figure out how those  other soil health issues.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:14):**  Right.  And I guess, I really appreciate you guys challenging guys like me to do what you're  doing.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:20):**  If I was going to flip the table, my challenge to you guys would be, how can I do that?  How can I mimic getting cows on the land?  And maybe you'll tell me it's just plain not possible.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:32):**  Maybe it's not.  But if there's a way I could do that, I'd be all about it.  And I like to think that there's some creative way.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:39):**  Especially if you're into innovation.  Yeah.  I mean, if it's...  
**[1:21:44-1:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:44):**  I just don't think there is a replacement for having livestock on the land grazing the  plants.  And maybe not.  
**[1:21:51-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:21:51):**  And maybe not.  And we talked about the microbiome in the saliva.  So your manure system, you have a central pit that you collect and you haul out several  
**[1:22:03-1:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:22:03):**  times a year.  So there's different biological processes that happen when that manure is in a pit.  There's different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that get to eat versus when those manure are  
**[1:22:15-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:22:15):**  in pats out in the pasture.  Because even when I've done super high stock density, like 50,000 pounds an acre a day,  your pats are two and a half, three feet apart still.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:22:28):**  So they're not all commingled and they're all exposed to air.  It's all exposed to air or ground contact and it's never more than an inch or two thick.  So there's different breakdown processes happening in the manure when it's dropped on the ground  
**[1:22:44-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:22:44):**  versus...  When it's dropped on soil versus when it goes to a pit.  So there's some biology differences in there.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:22:54):**  I have thought about it and it's hard for me to see what can replace animals on the  land other than animals on the land.  That's fair.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:03):**  And like I was saying, even if it is...  Because of your context, you got to keep doing what you're doing.  Maybe it is making a tweak in your heifer development program and how they eat.  
**[1:23:18-1:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:18):**  And maybe that's the easy place to start.  It's like a test trial.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:24):**  I wonder what the Ranching Paddock is going to say if they have any ideas they want to  add into our Facebook page once they hear this episode.  That's a good call.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:31):**  If you have any good ideas for Dan where you might start...  Take it to the Facebook group, Ranching Reboot Paddock.  So I don't want to draw this thing out.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:41):**  I don't know how much time you guys have.  But...  I don't have anything.  
**[1:23:47-1:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:47):**  We had another half hour, Dan.  We're fine.  All right.  
**[1:23:51-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:51):**  People complain about if the episode isn't an hour.  They start yelling.  So let's think about this really long term.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:23:59):**  We've kind of made fun of those farmers out in Illinois and Indiana that just love seeing  dust fly.  Let's go to the dramatic end, like them.  
**[1:24:07-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:24:07):**  And let's go to the other dramatic end, which would be like...  I'm not calling you guys dramatic, but you guys are on two separate sides of the spectrum.  I like to think of myself somewhere in the middle, leaning your guys' direction.  
**[1:24:18-1:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:24:18):**  So let's look at this a century from now, or 50 years, or 200 years.  Are you guys...  Obviously, we kind of know where those guys...  
**[1:24:27-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:24:27):**  The soil isn't going to be great.  But if I don't do what you're doing, if I don't get my cows...  If my 150 acres down here on the dairy farm, if that land never sees a cow, but I can meet  
**[1:24:43-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:24:43):**  at least four or five of the six principles of soil health...  Your carbon's going up, your organic matter's going up, and you don't have herbicide, pesticide  runoff and you don't have soil erosion.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:24:56):**  And that might be good enough because just the way some dairy operations have to exist.  And I think looking at 100 years down the line is kind of optimistic.  I have a hard time getting past 10 or 15 years of agriculture and trying to wrap my head  
**[1:25:15-1:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:25:15):**  around the change.  Like we were talking earlier, diesel fuel is right around $3 a gallon right now for  the cherry flavor.  
**[1:25:25-1:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:25:25):**  And gosh, what if that goes to $6 a gallon?  What's that look like for all those guys that love to burn diesel in those big tractors  this fall?  
**[1:25:34-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:25:34):**  Oh, I already got all my fuel bought.  I got my fuel contracted.  Well, big fucking deal.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:25:40):**  What happens next year when it's $12 a gallon?  Have you thought about that?  Anyway, so what does farming look like when the cost of input starts going up?  
**[1:25:53-1:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:25:53):**  It's inevitable that they will.  The current administration is talking about a carbon tax and an energy tax.  And depending on where they apply that, it's either just going to be a wealth redistribution  
**[1:26:07-1:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:07):**  scheme or it's going to be economic Armageddon.  If they apply it at the wellhead and it's fairly applied at the wellhead, it's economic  Armageddon in 24 months.  
**[1:26:20-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:20):**  But in terms of soil health, if I can't get a cow back on the land and I can meet the  other ones, what's the end goal?  Am I still going to be able to grow crops in 50 years?  
**[1:26:32-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:32):**  Is my soil going to be so far gone?  You know what I'm trying to say?  Look at the guys that like the recreational till.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:39):**  I mean, I got guys in this area, they till because they just enjoy it.  Whatever.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:26:44-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:44):**  People love harvesting hay.  That's the worst thing I would ever think about doing also is harvesting hay.  Yeah.  
**[1:26:52-1:27:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:26:52):**  Well, according to Bob Kinford, I like to do recreational fencing.  But in a hundred years, the guy in my area that just loves recreational ripping, is his  soil not, in your mind, in your opinion, is his soil just not going to be able to grow  
**[1:27:05-1:27:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:05):**  crops?  Yeah.  Well, it oxidizes.  
**[1:27:08-1:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:08):**  It's going to be sterile.  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.  The vast majority of farmers, like the ones we're talking about, they're not farming  
**[1:27:17-1:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:17):**  soil.  They're farming dirt.  They're farming substrate.  
**[1:27:21-1:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:21):**  And they're farming inputs.  And they pour everything on it that the plant needs.  The plant's getting nothing.  
**[1:27:27-1:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:27):**  It's just growing in substrate.  You might as well have a damn aquaponics farm at that point.  Well, and what gets me is when you run, a lot of these guys run up chisel plows 14 inches  
**[1:27:36-1:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:36):**  deep.  And the god says the logs down there and you're bringing it up here.  And yeah, again, I'm totally on your guys' page with those concepts.  
**[1:27:45-1:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:45):**  But I'm trying to, you know, so let's look at my field, my farm.  Obviously, those fields are going to turn sterile.  They're not going to grow crops if they like to till 14 inches deep for the next 50 years  
**[1:27:57-1:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:27:57):**  and not put any manure.  It's all synthetic fertilizer.  There's no manure going on that ground.  
**[1:28:00-1:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:00):**  There's no animals on that ground.  Yeah, let's go do a Haney test on some of their soil.  Yeah, I really wanted to.  
**[1:28:09-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:09):**  There's another good one.  Have you heard of the, I think it's PLFA?  We haven't done anything like that, but my friend Tom definitely talked about it.  
**[1:28:18-1:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:18):**  You should have some PLFA's run.  They give you kind of an idea where you're at with like the fungal bacterial micro balance  in the soil.  
**[1:28:24-1:28:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:24):**  And I guess the PLFA has only been around what, like two years, CK?  It's pretty new.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:31-1:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:31):**  Okay.  And it's just, just again, two years is new.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:35-1:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:35):**  Right.  But like hypothetically, if I'm able to improve the metrics on the Haney test and improve  the metrics on that test, and I'm not putting cows, and I know you said you don't think  
**[1:28:45-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:45):**  it's possible to do this without putting cows in the ground, but let's say somehow I'm super  creative.  I find some way to make it happen.  
**[1:28:53-1:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:28:53):**  Yeah.  Then our goals are the same, right?  So maybe my way of cattle farming isn't bad, if that's possible, just hypothetically.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:01):**  Yeah.  I guess the only thing I'm thinking of is there an opportunity cost that we're not talking  about right now by not having animals out there?  
**[1:29:09-1:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:09):**  Like do we know what the potential would be?  And that would be, I'm obviously hard to validate without the cows being out there, but is there  an opportunity cost by not doing it?  
**[1:29:23-1:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:23):**  That's what I see every time somebody's going out with a sprayer to terminate a crop is  opportunity cost.  It's like, you're going to go out and kill that beautiful forage that cows would just  
**[1:29:32-1:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:32):**  love to eat.  I think about even the tractors you have, how much do they cost?  Do they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars?  
**[1:29:43-1:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:43):**  Well, I still got the same tractors my grandpa had with my dad.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  
**[1:29:48-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:48):**  I got a couple new ones we use for loader work and stuff.  But yeah, they're super expensive.  We'll have some paradigm shift challenges that happen with branches who also have a  
**[1:29:59-1:30:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:29:59):**  haying operation on the side and they decide to sell the tractors, get out of the hay business  and get into the pasture business of grazing.  And you think about not having the maintenance of the depreciating tractor, not paying the  
**[1:30:16-1:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:30:16):**  fuel costs.  Also the labor that's not going into that.  Those are all, to me, opportunity costs that are helping the operation, not losing money  
**[1:30:27-1:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:30:27):**  and also sustaining another family.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  
**[1:30:33-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:30:33):**  And another way to look at it is how much iron do you own that doesn't move but one  or two days a month?  Not very much.  
**[1:30:44-1:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:30:44):**  A lot of our equipment is used.  We have one, two, three, four, five, four.  It doesn't sound like you have any monuments to tax avoidance on Honey Creek Dairy.  
**[1:30:57-1:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:30:57):**  Our four cab tractors, we have two uncab tractors.  I don't use those a whole lot.  Again, they're my grandpa's.  
**[1:31:04-1:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:04):**  But the other ones all get, the lowest one is $500 a year.  The highest one is $900 a year.  So we're putting a lot of hours on those tractors.  
**[1:31:12-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:12):**  A lot of that is going to feed the cows.  We got manure spreaders and stuff like that too.  Your opportunity costs definitely make sense.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:20):**  I looked at that even pasturing.  If we were to pasture the heifer farm, that'd be a lot of labor, I would say.  I don't have to mix up feed and dump it every day and bag it and pay for the plastic and  
**[1:31:29-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:29):**  pay for the fuel to bag it and all that stuff.  Trust me, I totally get that.  I got to make sure though I can feed the amount of animals I need to on the acres I have.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:39):**  Again, at the end of the day, I got to ship.  If I could lower my feed cost, I could ship less milk.  Our nutritionists and me, we do a good job of trying to look at income over feed costs.  
**[1:31:52-1:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:52):**  There's a farm down the road, they're at 110 pounds of milk.  I'm at 95.  Holy crap.  
**[1:31:57-1:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:31:57):**  They're 15 pounds per cow higher than me.  I know for a fact, they're feeding molasses at the robot.  That's $500 a ton.  
**[1:32:06-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:32:06):**  That extra 15 pounds of milk, they're buying it.  They're buying that extra 15 pounds of milk.  So that's not a place where I want to be either.  
**[1:32:13-1:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:32:13):**  Like I said, my overall feed bill hasn't changed when I went from 70 to 95 pounds of milk.  That pounds of milk I need to be at, that's still my goal, but like you said, I still  try to keep in mind, hey, maybe I could spend $6,000 less a year in plastic or in fuel or  
**[1:32:29-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:32:29):**  fertilizer, those kinds of things.  With the cover crop and the manure management we're doing, when I first started farming,  again, I was an idiot, I was putting side dressing like 190 units of nitrogen out on  
**[1:32:44-1:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:32:44):**  the fields.  And this year we did 80 to 90.  We cut that in half, our amount of synthetic fertilizer.  
**[1:32:49-1:33:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:32:49):**  Every year I'm lowering that and I'm very confident someday I'll get to the point where  I don't need hardly any commercial fertilizer.  Because I look at some of the fields by grandpa, mow water over and over, I'm paying the dues  
**[1:33:00-1:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:00):**  on those now.  Because one of the fields I have, it needs a butt load of fertilizer.  And that's a field where some kind of grazing thing, I shouldn't say grazing thing, I'm  
**[1:33:10-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:10):**  not trying to mock it, but you know, some type of high density ruminant grazing concept  would do that field wonders.  But instead my local co-op is saying, hey, let's go throw $12,000 of fertilizer at it  
**[1:33:21-1:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:21):**  from a floater.  Well, of course they want to do that.  They sell fertilizer.  
**[1:33:26-1:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:26):**  I know.  So that's where again, I feel like I'm on your guys's team, but I'm trying to figure  out how I can do it and still meet my production goals.  
**[1:33:38-1:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:38):**  You know what I'm saying?  Okay.  So you're bedding in your barn.  
**[1:33:44-1:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:44):**  You said you use sand that you get from a sand pit.  And you have like a manure urine handling system, correct?  It goes to a pit, then you pump out of the pit and carry it out to the field and spray  
**[1:33:57-1:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:33:57):**  it on the field, right?  I know where you're going.  You're wondering about the sand going on the field.  
**[1:34:01-1:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:01):**  No.  I wasn't going to say anything about it.  The only thing I was going to say about the sand is wood chips.  
**[1:34:09-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:09):**  What if you just decommissioned your pit and went to wood chips and biochar for bedding  and then you scrape that out, you throw that in a compost pile and let it get happy for  a little bit and then you put it out on your field?  
**[1:34:27-1:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:27):**  Let me ask you this.  What if I could use my own manure as bedding?  Use your own manure as bedding?  
**[1:34:38-1:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:38):**  So here's the way, there's some farms doing this.  Dry it out.  I'm excited about it.  
**[1:34:42-1:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:42):**  Yeah.  They dry it out and they use that manure for bedding.  Now I'm not sure what that changes to the manure for what you want for soil health,  
**[1:34:50-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:50):**  but the reason we use sand is because it's inorganic and it can't grow bacteria for the  others.  That's really the number one reason for sand and cows can lay in it and they can nestle  
**[1:34:59-1:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:34:59):**  it nice and deep.  We get two, if we just have like a mattress out there with wood shavings on top compared  to sand, we get two or three hours more of line time, which for us equals more milk.  
**[1:35:12-1:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:35:12):**  But we have deep bedded sand.  There's farms where they run them in earth through a press, squeeze the liquids out.  They let it compost.  
**[1:35:20-1:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:35:20):**  They let it compost for a few months so it heats and kills the bad bacteria, the clemptiala,  the e coli, the staph, and then they put that back in the pen for bedding.  So they recycle it.  
**[1:35:30-1:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:35:30):**  But again, if you're looking at the biomes for soil, I don't know if that completely  just invalidates what the manure can bring to the soil or not.  I mean as soon as it comes out of the back of the cow, it starts cooling.  
**[1:35:48-1:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:35:48):**  You want it on the ground.  Or on other biological materials so it can interact with it and start to break down and  cycle the biology and cycle the nutrients.  
**[1:36:00-1:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:00):**  Okay, I see what you're saying.  Because if that process doesn't start, the pat falls on sand and it's inert sand with  no microbes, no bacteria in it, nothing.  
**[1:36:12-1:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:12):**  And I get where you're coming from, from a teat health and mastitis standpoint.  But that manure is just there and it starts an anaerobic decomposition process or it starts  a different decomposition process than it would if the manure pat fell on hay or dried  
**[1:36:29-1:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:29):**  cured grass or even green grass.  So you're saying put something else in the barn that that could interact with to start  those processes.  
**[1:36:36-1:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:36):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So no, I like that idea.  
**[1:36:39-1:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:39):**  And that's where I'm glad we can have this discussion because maybe something like that  could happen that could help me replicate getting cows out on the ground.  You know what I'm trying to say?  
**[1:36:48-1:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:48):**  So like right now, maybe we can't find any way to have that happen.  But if we can just keep this going, I think there's got to be a way.  You know, I mean, I'm an eternal optimist like my mom was.  
**[1:36:57-1:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:36:57):**  There's got to be a way I can replicate what Brian is doing by getting cows in the field.  Maybe not.  But if it's what's best for the soil, and we know it's what's best for the soil, but  
**[1:37:07-1:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:07):**  I can't do it right now.  Let's try to find some way to try to vindicate if I can.  And work to find someplace where you can start making those experiments.  
**[1:37:16-1:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:16):**  You know, right.  You're obviously your ownership, your labor, and your management on your operation.  And I'm the same way here.  
**[1:37:26-1:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:26):**  You know, I wear all three hats.  So if ownership decides we're going to do something cool or fun, labor is going to be  on board with it.  
**[1:37:36-1:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:36):**  It's not the tail wag and the dog situation around here, kind of like it is there on Honey  Creek.  But then again, every one of us, we're constrained by resources.  
**[1:37:47-1:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:47):**  We're constrained by our context.  And to do things cost money.  Yeah, if land and labor were free, I mean, we raise all the good cattle in the world,  
**[1:37:54-1:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:54):**  right?  Right.  Right.  
**[1:37:57-1:38:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:37:57):**  And I want to see my soil stay here for my son and my grandkids' staff.  So I don't want to be out there mole boarding.  I don't want to pick names, but there's a guy, there are people in the area that still  
**[1:38:06-1:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:06):**  mole board and they don't even have manure.  They're just mole boarding corn stalks.  And then they call the way to put corn on it.  
**[1:38:13-1:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:13):**  To me, that's nuts.  That's a whole other conversation.  Again, we won't say names, but you know, I want to try to meet those six principles of  
**[1:38:23-1:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:23):**  soil health in whatever way I can.  And so again, like we've been saying, I don't want to keep kicking a dead horse within context,  right?  
**[1:38:31-1:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:31):**  So.  You know, mimicking is one thing and you know, we're leaving out hoof action and herd effect.  Sure.  
**[1:38:39-1:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:39):**  Okay.  So I get that too.  You know, and one of the things that, you know, grass fed dairies get dinged on a lot for is having lanes going from their paddocks, you know, back and forth to the milking parlor or wherever their situation is.  
**[1:38:54-1:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:38:54):**  So because of the way my water is set up, my paddocks are set up here on the ranch.  I had a lane that was about 15 feet wide and it was a little over a half a mile long going  back and forth to water and it was just over a year ago.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:39:11):**  It was late May last year.  We had several pretty big rain events of over an inch.  We got an inch, then we got a half inch the next day, then we got an inch, then we got  
**[1:39:21-1:39:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:39:21):**  a day off and then we got another inch and a half.  And there was a couple hundred yards of that lane that those cows were walking down.  I looked at that and I was like, uh, okay, that's not good.  
**[1:39:34-1:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:39:34):**  Because it looked like a bulldozer had been through there and then a rototiller.  It was just chewed up and I thought, man, this is screwed.  This is screwed.  
**[1:39:45-1:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:39:45):**  And then I didn't go over there for three months and then I went back and it was seven  feet tall, big bluestem.  Like almost the exact width of the lane.  
**[1:39:54-1:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:39:54):**  Yeah, it was crazy.  I took Dallas Mount from RMC with me over there and I showed him that and he actually  has some pretty good footage of just like a 15 foot strip wide strip of big bluestem.  
**[1:40:07-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:40:07):**  And you can see right where it stops on one side.  And that's because of hoof action, hoof action and herd effect.  And before, okay, so what was there before was old world bluestem, which is like a garbage  
**[1:40:20-1:40:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:40:20):**  grass.  I'd rather it not ever had been invented by the USDA and King Ranch.  Thank you.  
**[1:40:25-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:40:25):**  But it's horrible grass for, you know, cows don't really like it.  It's really low on their prefer on a palatability list.  It's invasive, it's ground covers, you know, it's allotropic, it poisons the soil.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:40:37):**  It's all just all kinds of bad crap wrapped up into one.  That's what was in that lane.  And that's what's on either side of it.  
**[1:40:47-1:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:40:47):**  But what's in that lane that we pounded so hard with the cows, and even some of the  paddock corners where we're doing the daily moves, those converted from old world bluestem  to big bluestem in one growing season.  
**[1:41:01-1:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:01):**  Just some herd effect.  Interesting.  Sure.  
**[1:41:04-1:41:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:04):**  Sure.  And that's the catch too that we have to consider with dairies is we do have to get those cows  from this place to the milking center.  
**[1:41:10-1:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:10):**  But you know, that is probably the cheek in my armor for trying to get my milking cows  back on the land is the robots themselves.  So that's where until the robots, until my kids say these robots are stupid, dad, why  
**[1:41:25-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:25):**  did you ever buy these?  We can't get spare parts for them anywhere.  We're tree rigging these things.  
**[1:41:31-1:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:31):**  I can't get any microchips.  You know, that's where my cows, you know, I don't want to be a negative Nancy and just  put my steak in the ground.  
**[1:41:40-1:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:40):**  But that's where for me, my cows are probably going to be in my barn.  You know, I just don't see a way to get my milking herd in the field.  Now the heifers and dry cows, there's a whole nother conversation.  
**[1:41:50-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:50):**  We can definitely start with something.  Your dry cows might not even work.  Your dry cows might fall apart doing that.  
**[1:41:57-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:41:57):**  Honestly, like your heifers and not all of your heifers will likely succeed either.  But the ones that do, the ones that do succeed on that program are definitely ones to keep  track of and watch.  
**[1:42:09-1:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:09):**  Okay.  No, I mean, even just from a labor savings too, like I mentioned earlier, my dad gets  older and older.  
**[1:42:14-1:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:14):**  You know, if in the summer months we just had those animals on pasture, it would save  an hour and a half to two hours a day of mixing feed, delivering it, opening gates, all those  kinds of things.  
**[1:42:23-1:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:23):**  You know, and there's still some chores involved.  Obviously, I'm not saying you guys have it easy.  You kick your feet up all the time.  
**[1:42:28-1:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:28):**  But I mean, I do think the way we do things like you mentioned before, opportunity costs.  I do think we're missing out on some of them there too.  Wow.  
**[1:42:39-1:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:39):**  Man, it is, time has flown.  It is starting to get late.  It's almost two hours.  
**[1:42:46-1:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:46):**  Son of a-  Well, I hope everybody that's been complaining for the last couple of short episodes is going  to be happy with this one.  
**[1:42:52-1:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:42:52):**  Well, no, I really appreciate coming on here.  I'm really glad we could have two different farming styles and still at least have some  kind of common goal.  
**[1:43:03-1:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:03):**  I don't think all of agriculture is to where we are in pursuing this goal.  Like you said, it is ultimately to how do I get 10 more mussels of corn?  Okay, that's what I'm going to do.  
**[1:43:15-1:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:15):**  That's kind of unfortunately where some of us are like, my father-in-law, he's in central  Iowa.  Down there, they have 98 CSR ground.  
**[1:43:24-1:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:24):**  It's a whole different soil type than up here.  But he started to do strip till and they used to do full tillage.  So I mean, he's moving to less and less stuff.  
**[1:43:30-1:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:30):**  I'm trying to get him on the cover crop things.  He doesn't even have animals.  There's hardly any livestock around him except for some guys that have beef cows.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:38):**  So it's going to be a whole another conversation to get these mass 5,000 acre row crop farms . That's where this is a whole other podcast, but I'd be interested to see your guys take  on.  
**[1:43:49-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:49):**  Iowa is full of row crop farms.  That's all we are.  We got pigs too.  
**[1:43:53-1:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:43:53):**  Obviously we're the number one pig state, but how does Iowa make this happen?  You guys have great soil.  That's the reason we grow a lot of corn.  
**[1:44:05-1:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:44:05):**  And so if you could do that, imagine what else you could do that if you have plant diversity,  certain plants produce certain nutrients to the soil.  So if you have that synergistic quality, like it's, I think like you said, people are transitioning,  
**[1:44:21-1:44:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:44:21):**  even if they don't realize they're doing regenerative type deals, they're transitioning to focus  on soil health or, you know, yeah.  Right.  
**[1:44:31-1:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:44:31):**  Yeah.  So yeah, it'll be interesting to see, you know, what, what happened, you know, these  farms out there that are still doing a lot of tillage, you know, if those soils do start  
**[1:44:40-1:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:44:40):**  becoming more and more sterile, that's going to really start staring a lot of people.  So, and by that point it's hard to turn around, you know what I'm saying?  Well, you know, like with, I keep bringing up the cost of fuel, you know, if the cost  
**[1:44:51-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:44:51):**  of fuel goes up, it's going to be a lever.  All of your fertilizers, all of your input costs are going to go up and your inputting  cost is going to go up.  
**[1:45:01-1:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:01):**  I mean, the prices of all these fertilizers and synthetic inputs are tied to the price  of oil.  Right.  
**[1:45:08-1:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:08):**  And that's where I'm glad too, like, you know, obviously I still rely on diesel fuel like  every dairy farm does, but the less synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, you know,  our herbicide usage this year is half is what it's ever been because of our carbon crop.  
**[1:45:22-1:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:22):**  So I mean, we're able to start phasing out a lot of those types of inputs too.  So, but yeah, man, two hours went fast.  Yeah, it did.  
**[1:45:30-1:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:30):**  And I don't think we left anything on the table.  Did we, Suresa?  No, Karissa.  
**[1:45:36-1:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:36):**  Karissa.  It's okay.  That's why I'm CK, guys.  
**[1:45:39-1:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:39):**  Brian's depreciated, so that's a wrap.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  
**[1:45:42-1:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:42):**  My battery's done.  No, we've covered a lot.  I think we definitely would love to have you on another episode if we have another series  
**[1:45:45-1:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:45):**  to talk about Iowa and stuff like that.  So that'd be great.  Yeah.  
**[1:45:48-1:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:48):**  Or if you guys ever have any ideas for, hey, we didn't talk about this, this might work  for you guys.  Or if somebody has an idea that might be, again, you know, with my dairy cows, people  
**[1:45:51-1:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:51):**  might be like, oh, I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  
**[1:45:54-1:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:45:54):**  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  
**[1:46:26-1:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:46:26):**  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  
**[1:47:13-1:47:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:47:13):**  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  I'm going to have to go to the dairy farm.  
**[1:47:50-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/20-Dan-Venticher-Honey-Creek-Dairy-e134oeg#t=1:47:50):**  All right.  And that's a wrap. .

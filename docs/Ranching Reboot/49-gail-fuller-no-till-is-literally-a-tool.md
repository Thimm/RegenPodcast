**[0:00:58-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:00:58):**  And I booked my week so solid.  I had a call at 10, a call at 1, your call at 3.30.  Then I got a meeting tonight at 6.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:09):**  And I was half hour late getting off my last call.  And I'm thinking, man, I got to be on at 3.  For some reason, thank God for you.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:16):**  I had it in my head at 3 or I'd be late because I always am.  We'll try not to keep you too long today.  CK won't be joining us.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:23):**  She stuck in Texas visiting the lovely Birdwell and Clark ranch today, Emery Birdwell and  Emery Clark.  Yeah, so yeah, it's probably a little warmer down there.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:35):**  I don't know how cold it was over at Severy this morning.  It was brutal.  We were promised 40 degrees and sunshine today and we're not going to hit 30 and we're cloudy  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:45):**  and it even spit a couple of times.  Wind chills in the teens.  It's nothing close to what they forecast.  
**[0:01:51-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:01:51):**  They were saying maybe we'd get an inch of snow and it ended up being a little over two.  So I'm not going to complain about that.  Moisture is moisture, never cuss a rain or a baby calf.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:01):**  Nope.  Yeah, I would have taken the moisture.  I guess I saw something somewhere this afternoon that there was a band of snow from eastern  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:12):**  Colorado through central Kansas.  It was 20 to 30 inches.  Yeah, like out there in western Kansas, there are a couple places.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:19):**  I think somewhere I saw it got like 27 inches of snow.  Not that we don't need the moisture, but we don't need that much snow.  It's a little excessive.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:31):**  I understood that it was kind of unforecasted.  So 27 inches of snow is one thing, but when you don't know it's coming, that makes it  a little tough on you and me.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:40):**  I think the most I saw in forecast was like maybe something around six, maybe eight inches.  Yeah, wow, a little less than ideal to have 27 to deal with.  Yeah, I could sure use 27 inches of snow, but I'm not sure how I would deal with it  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:02:58):**  for the first week.  Is it getting a little dry over there?  Yeah, we're really dry.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:03:06):**  We've had nothing recorded in January.  We had three tents with that big storm in December, zero in November, zero in September,  and I think zero in July.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:03:17):**  Oh, wow.  So yeah, your drought is definitely starting to soak in there.  Yeah, but we did have good rains in August and October, which is a little odd, but take  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:03:31):**  what we can get when we can get it.  Kind of the nature of the business.  So it certainly is.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:03:38):**  So for our listeners here, why don't you tell us what your business is?  Uh, my business is growing food for my customers, providing clean air, clean water and high  nutrition.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:03:55):**  Awesome.  So what's, what's the name of this business?  The farm name is Fuller Farms and we market our products, which is grass finished beef  
**[0:04:07-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:07):**  and lamb, pastured pork, chicken, duck, eggs.  It's all market under the label Circle 7 LLC.  Okay, great.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:17):**  And where are you located at?  The farm is at Severy, Kansas on the very Eastern edge of the beautiful scenic Flint  Hills.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:26):**  Okay.  I guess I should have looked at a map and got a little more familiar with Severy is,  but you're, you're almost straight East of me.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:35):**  Literally straight East, one hour of Wichita.  So yeah, probably almost literally straight East of you and pretty, pretty close.  Good deal.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:42):**  And you said you had ducks.  I didn't know you guys were doing ducks.  Is that a meat ducks or duck eggs?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:49):**  We're doing meat ducks.  It was a bit of an accident, uh, but we've got them and it's not, it's not, uh, a major  enterprise.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:04:58):**  It's more of kind of a holiday break from having lamb, pork, chicken, and beef all the  time.  We always raise them seasonally just to have around the holidays to market.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:05:08):**  We enjoy having them around.  It's like I said, it's certainly not a huge enterprise at any given time.  There's somewhere between five and a hundred ducks running around.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:05:17):**  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Maybe we'll circle back in here and talk a little bit more about that later.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:05:24):**  But first I want to, I want to hear the story of Gale.  Like I know some I've been hearing your name for years and I, one of these days I've got  to get over for one of your field days, because it looks like you guys just have an enormous,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:05:39):**  an enormously good time.  So tell us, uh, how did you get your start in agriculture?  What was your education upbringing and a start in agriculture?  
**[0:05:49-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:05:49):**  Like my upbringing was I, I grew up on what was probably a pretty typical family farm  in Eastern Kansas in the sixties and seventies.  I'm 59 years old, some classes, 62 model, uh, you know, growing up, we, we had a lot  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:08):**  of crop land.  We had six, seven different crops in our rotation.  We had cows.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:13):**  Our main enterprise was pigs farm, had some chickens.  Our grandparents lived on the farm and as separate residents, you know, three gardens.  Uh, I, I just thought it was pretty typical growing up.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:25):**  We looked like a lot of our neighbors, maybe different enterprises.  That was the cool thing about the community, you know, in the sixties and seventies was,  uh, you know, we had neighbors growing blackberries.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:35):**  We had neighbors growing pheasant.  We had neighbors in the dairy business.  You know, the community was growing a little bit of everything, which was, which was really  
**[0:06:42-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:42):**  cool.  Um, so that, that's how I grew up pretty conventional farm.  Uh, I graduated high school in 1981 and between my ADHD, which really hindered my schooling,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:06:57):**  my public schooling, uh, I really didn't have any desire to go to college and they probably  didn't want me either.  Uh, and besides, you know, I kept thinking, well, my dad's a farmer.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:07):**  Why do I need to spend thousands of dollars to go to K state to learn how to farm?  So that was my course of action.  Uh, obviously, well, I, I rented my first piece of land in 1979 as a 4-H project, bought  
**[0:07:19-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:19):**  my first farm in 1982, first 40 acres.  You know, anybody that's my age is probably wincing right now, you know, somebody buying  his first piece of land in the early eighties at 16% interest.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:32):**  It wasn't pretty.  And it got pretty ugly for a while.  I can imagine.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:37):**  I can imagine.  How, uh, go ahead.  No, go on.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:42):**  Well, my, you know, I think the eighties was obviously the defining decade, you know, maybe  compared to the dust bowl, the two defining decades of the 20th century for agriculture,  sadly, both pretty ugly decades.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:07:57):**  The seventies was a fabulous decade.  I can still remember on January 1st, 1980, uh, except for our 30, 20, which every farmer  at that time had a 30, 20 or 40, 20, um, except for our 30, 20, every piece of equipment on  
**[0:08:11-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:08:11):**  the farm is less than two years old.  You know, our dad's biggest issue every year was December.  Could he spend enough money to avoid paying all those taxes?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:08:20):**  So, you know, it was roaring times.  And then the eighties said, uh, fortunately for us, my dad was a substitute milk carrier  and he got an opportunity to go full time in the early eighties.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:08:31):**  And that's probably the only reason we survived it.  You know, I, you know, sorry to say, I wish I'd, you know, I'd like to say we survived  it by buying really good farmers are really smart, but, uh, those, that decade was so  
**[0:08:42-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:08:42):**  tough.  It just, it wiped out anybody that didn't have means of making income elsewhere.  Us included Mike Callicrates talked a little bit about that before and several other guests  
**[0:08:53-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:08:53):**  that have been in the business for almost as long or about as long as you have.  I've kind of talked about what a tough decade, the eighties was, what made it so tough and  why were things so good in the seventies?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:06):**  Do you have anything to say about that?  You know, it's just, it's going to be my opinion on the seventies because I was literally a  kid.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:14):**  So I'm not paying a whole lot of attention, except it was fun driving the equipment.  It is fun driving new stuff.  It is fun driving new stuff.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:23):**  You know, Earl, but obviously had a big role in it.  Uh, you know, with, with the feed the world farm fence, road to fence, row farmers become  specialists and lose the diversity.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:33):**  And you know, I can remember that and the crew talking about that, about, you know,  we needed more acres and, uh, you know, the farm grew pretty rapidly through the late  seventies.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:45):**  Uh, it was just, it was pretty easy farming markets for good.  So it wasn't that hard to make money.  You know, farming is never easy, but that was about as easy as it could get, I think.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:09:55):**  And then the eighties set, you know, we, we blamed Jimmy Carter at the time with the,  with the embargo with Russia and the wheat, but really looking back, that was really just  the last nail in the coffin, you know, high interest rates, you know, everything just  
**[0:10:10-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:10:10):**  kind of flipped on us overnight from 79 to 80, 81.  And it got, it got really tough, really fast.  And you know, I can still remember, you know, I graduated high school in 81, started farming,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:10:24):**  got married in 83.  You know, I'm trying to buy ground by cattle by 1985.  I think it was in December of 85.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:10:33):**  At the end of the year, the bank told us make money next year or start off, start liquidating,  uh, had my first child born in 86.  My, we lost our main barn to a fire in 86.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:10:47):**  My brother had brain tumor in 86, plus the fact that, you know, we were forced to make  money in 86.  And it, it was just, you know, what a difficult year and what the stress brings to you of,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:10:59):**  you know, we'd certainly know today watching this meltdown in the economy today and the  stress and the depression is things that come with it that, that get to you sooner or later.  Tell me it got better in 87.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:11:15):**  It did.  We, we got, uh, you know, a little bit lucky.  We, we played our cards right through 86, even with all the, the, the personal trauma  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:11:24):**  we had.  And in 87, we got really lucky.  We, the eighties had been also fairly dry and, and some, the stars kind of aligned for  
**[0:11:32-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:11:32):**  us in 87.  We had a decent year when other farms didn't, and we were able to get our head back above  water and, and, you know, made it into the nineties somehow.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:11:44):**  Hey, so what were you growing on the farm around that timeframe?  Like late eighties?  Uh, by the, by the mid late eighties.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:11:54):**  So my brother went to college.  He was smarter than me.  He got home from college in 86.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:12:00):**  I think it was, and we'd tried farming together with me and him and dad.  And, and we all got along fine, but we had too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  And so about that time we divided the farm up.

**[0:12:18-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:12:18):**  Uh, by that time, you know, I'm, I'm running all the road crop.  We're growing corn, soybeans.  We still got some solids and some alfalfa in the operation.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:12:27):**  Uh, wheat was basically gone.  Milo was on its way out.  Milo and we were both on their way out, you know, by the time, by the time my farm peaked  
**[0:12:37-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:12:37):**  in the year 2000, I was down to Roundup, ready corn and soybeans.  The cows had even been kicked off the grass and kicked off the farm ground.  They were confined to a feedlot, which, you know, in the eighties, we were still grazing  
**[0:12:48-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:12:48):**  stocks and grazing some pastures and things like that.  So in 2000, it sounds like it looks like pretty much most of the rest of the typical production  conventional ag operations around a lot of green machinery, a lot of iron, a couple of  
**[0:13:07-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:07):**  pickups full of tools, a lot of debt, a lot of, a lot of green machinery, a lot of debt,  a lot of rented land.  We were following the model, you know, become specialists.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:17):**  We got rid of all of the crops.  We could, once I switched to no till, we were told the cows had to go.  So we sold the cows or I sold the cows and yep, we were farming with the bank by that  
**[0:13:28-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:28):**  time full blown.  How many acres are you guys farming then?  By the year 2000, I'd grown the grain side of the operation to 3,200 acres.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:41):**  I have no clue what my brother had at that time, but I'm guessing he was well over 2000  acres of the grass.  And when I say grass, it was all hay.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:50):**  Our family's in the hay business.  We're not in the grazing business.  So those were all pastures for hay meadows.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:13:56):**  Pastures have been converted to hay meadows.  Okay.  So that sounds like it's way different from what you're doing now, which we'll get back  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:14:05):**  into.  So take us through 2000 to 2010.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:14:12):**  It's kind of funny because in 2000, when you look back between my brother and I, we had  to be the two biggest haters of carbon in Kansas.  You know, we're hauling all the grass to Western Kansas to the feedlots.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:14:26):**  My rotation was corn and soybeans.  My two largest landowners at the time were both feedlots and the corn was all being chopped  for silage.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:14:34):**  And so, you know, we're hauling off any ounce of carbon we can find, which it's sad.  I'm laughing about it today, but the sad part was, you know, for me personally, you know,  in the year 2000, I'm 38 years old now.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:14:51):**  I had no clue what the carbon cycle, mineral cycle, you know, water cycle, energy flow,  none of that.  Explain what you mean about exporting the carbon.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:03):**  Well, we were exporting grain.  Soybeans are a low CN ratio crop.  There's really no residue left for the soil surface once you harvest the soybeans.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:14):**  And like any else, really low CN ratios.  There's really nothing going back into the soil.  We were harvesting the corn for silage.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:20):**  We're taking not just the ear, we're taking the entire plant and hauling it to a feedlot,  putting it in a silo.  My brother's harvesting all of our grassland for hay, putting strings around it, hauling  
**[0:15:30-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:30):**  it all to Western Kansas.  So, you know, we were in the carbon export business for a few decades.  Okay.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:39):**  So I guess, continue on through the 2000s.  Well, as you can imagine, my farm paid a high price for that.  You know, by 2000, we had converted to no till because I had this hatred of soil erosion.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:15:55):**  And the so-called experts at the time told me that once we got two or three years into  no till that, you know, my life was perfect, that we'd reached the pinnacle, that everything  would just be wonderful, and we're five years into no till and erosion has not gotten better,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:16:11):**  it might have gotten worse in places.  And by 2002, I'm ready to go back to conventional tillage because I can't make no till work.  And I was talked into rather forcibly by an agronomist at the no till on the plains conference  
**[0:16:28-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:16:28):**  that year to plant one field of wheat.  And I gave him every excuse that every farmer had for not growing wheat in Eastern Kansas  that were too wet, were too warm at night, blah, blah, blah, you know, I had all the  
**[0:16:40-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:16:40):**  typical farmer excuses.  And he finally looked at me with a just, he was so sick of listening to me says, God damn  it, Gail, just plant one field and talk to me next year.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:16:52):**  And within one year, wheat was my number one cash crop.  We had planted some cover crops in the late 90s.  But I didn't understand my context.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:16:59):**  I didn't, I was planning them to prevent erosion, but I'm planting radishes and turnips, not  really crops, cover crops that are really good at preventing erosion.  But when we planted that one wheat crop in 2002, in my mind, everything clicked, that  
**[0:17:16-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:17:16):**  it wasn't the no till it was my, it was my mismanagement of the farm and the rotation,  my lack of understanding of context, my thinking that no till is the answer when no till was  literally a tool.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:17:29):**  And I suddenly realized what cover crops were meant to do.  And that's when I learned what carbon was.  It was really sad, like I said, that, you know, I'm now 40 years old, and none of these  
**[0:17:41-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:17:41):**  things were ever taught to us in soil class or any farming workshops I'd ever attended  was carbon cycle, mineral cycle, water infiltration, any of these things.  So you know, from 2002 to 2010, it was a sharp learning curve.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:17:55):**  Okay.  So soil health journey started in 2002 to 2010.  So what's the operation look like in about 2010?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:18:06):**  By 2010, we had gone from a corn soybean, all Roundup ready rotation to a five year  rotation of a mix of cool and warm season grasses and one year of broadleaf.  We had about 15, 16 different grain crops that we could plug in and out of that rotation.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:18:24):**  We're growing cover crop for seed, we're growing tash grain, non GMO for mostly the commodity  market, we did get a little premium for non GMO, but it wasn't much.  It didn't take a rocket scientist to look at that first real true cover crop in 2002  
**[0:18:39-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:18:39):**  and say this is forage.  And the cows came back really fast.  In the fall of 2002 or 2003, I literally traded a semi load of corn for nine coal cows from  
**[0:18:54-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:18:54):**  a from a neighboring ranch.  And I still remember taking them to our 40 acre playground where we were experimenting,  backing the trailer up, letting them out.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:03):**  And Lynette and I both looked at each other set of prayer, and just hope that they were  alive the next morning we went checked on them because we're growing things that we  can, you know, we can find any data on if they would eat it.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:14):**  And if it did, would it kill them?  I mean, it was literally that much of an experiment at that point in time.  That's that sounds pretty cool.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:22):**  That's that's really cool.  So how'd those cows do?  They were all alive the next morning.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:28):**  And not only were they alive, but they were in love with me.  Probably all kinds of good stuff to eat out there that they never thought they wanted.  Exactly.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:38):**  And obviously, this happened in the fall, you know, trading corn for cows.  This was October.  So you know, the native grasses were all done.  
**[0:19:44-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:19:44):**  So you know, their option would have been staying on the ranch they were on and eating  hay all winter and a little grain or me turning them out on a rye pea oat cover crop mix that  was green for another 30 or 40 days and they thought they had died and gone to heaven.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:00):**  They were they were happy campers.  I got some cold cows.  What do you want to trade me for them?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:08):**  Not as interested today.  Okay, so by 2010.  Sounds like you guys had really diversified what you're growing, brought some cows back  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:20):**  to the land.  But you're still on quite a few acres.  Yes.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:25):**  Yeah, I'm, I'm still probably 2500 acres plus.  You know, we had realized with with the wheat and then you know, my becoming a sponge for  information and and, you know, another thing about me, I told you, I'm ADHD.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:43):**  I just have my my observation is I'm wired different than a lot of people.  And that's why they call it I don't know, diverse.  We'll go with that.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:20:54):**  That's a pleasant way of putting it.  But I realized the need for diversity.  I also got really lucky about that time.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:01):**  And you know, I because I was the first one in Kansas to start planting cover crops, I  got asked to do some speaking at workshops, and then at some large conferences and was  able at that time to meet, you know, people like Gabe Brown and Dr. Jill Claperton and  
**[0:21:14-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:14):**  Jill was really the one being the scientist that could back up what I was doing.  And she was the one that really helped, you know, gave me the pat on the back or held  my hand trying all this diversity and encouraged me to continue, you know, get away from monocultures  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:32):**  and we're planting multi species cover crops.  And we're having dinner.  She's at my house one night.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:38):**  This is probably 2004 or 2005.  And I said, Jill, this is really working.  You know, our corn is responding.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:44):**  Our yields are good.  The test weight of the grain is going up.  But I got a question for you.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:21:52):**  Why are you wanting me to plant multi species cover crops?  We're planting our corn in a monoculture.  And she just smiled and she goes, I've been waiting on you to ask that question.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:02):**  And so starting in 2006, we're planting clovers with our corn and strips and doing some experimenting  like that.  And that was really cool.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:12):**  It was just, you know, Brian, it made farming fun.  That monoculture stuff doesn't work very good for a guy that's ADHD.  You know, he didn't go out every morning and looking at all of these different things that  
**[0:22:24-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:24):**  are growing.  And it was fun and exciting.  And probably for the first time in 10 or 20 years, I wanted to get out of bed every morning  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:34):**  and go to work.  It was just a blast.  That's kind of how I felt when I started doing the strip grazing.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:39):**  Like I kind of got a little burnout on a few things and getting in the strip grazing, going  out and moving the cattle every day.  It really helped settle my mind.  
**[0:22:50-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:22:50):**  I want to back up a little bit and talk about your clover strips and corn.  Can you tell me a little bit about how that works and what that did for you?  Because I think there's more than one person that listens to this podcast that grows corn.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:23:03):**  Sure.  You know, in the beginning, it was working with Jill who had a lot better knowledge of  plants than I did.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:23:11):**  But this time, I think my knowledge is certainly better and my confidence.  But in the beginning, we're just looking at low growing plants that can tolerate some  shade, would not compete with the corn for moisture, and maybe possibly convert some  
**[0:23:30-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:23:30):**  nitrogen from the legume to the corn plant late season to help boost yield and test weight  of the corn.  It worked fantastic.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:23:40):**  And from there, you know, it wasn't long after that we run into a lunatic scientist named  Dr. Jonathan Lundgren.  This is now we're in 2008, 2009.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:23:50):**  And as you can imagine, the next thing that happens after we start planting all these  cover crops, the insect population on my farm explodes.  And as a farmer, that is a really, really bad thing.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:24:04):**  You know, we've been trained for decades that if you see an insect, you kill an insect and,  but we're seeing ladybugs and, and all of these other things.  And I'm like, you know, I think I'm supposed to like ladybugs.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:24:16):**  But I don't know why.  And so we ran into Jonathan at No-Till-No Plains, and met him and got an understanding  of the predator-prey relationship.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:24:26):**  And yes, there are really good insects and almost all insects are good.  And so then we started trying to add things into our cover crops and our companion mixes  in our corn and our other crops that would attract more insects and attract pollinators  
**[0:24:41-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:24:41):**  and attract predator species.  And so then it become about, you know, even adding more diversity, you know, bringing  in things like buckwheat and things that may not necessarily be legumes that add direct  
**[0:24:52-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:24:52):**  benefits to corn, but if they can attract pollinators or, you know, beneficial insects,  and it's all just a win-win at the end of the day.  I think like beneficial insects is very understated.

And I remember going through the 80s.  And it was, you know, the mindset even through the 80s and early 90s was, well, we got to  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:25:19):**  kill it all.  We got to kill it all that no-till crap doesn't work, just farm it up, spray a chemical on  it.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:25:25):**  Can't have any bugs, can't have anything at all in the fields.  Fields have to be totally, completely clean.  I think a couple of decades of that, you know, clean field mentality, it kind of circles  
**[0:25:38-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:25:38):**  back to, you know, what Michael Thompson was saying in his episode that they designed these  farming systems to work in a flower pot in a lab.  And to make them work out in the real world, it's just such a high-input operation with  
**[0:25:54-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:25:54):**  all the, you know, herbicides, pesticides, you know, and in this case, we're talking  about the pesticides.  Yeah, you can grow anything inside.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:26:04):**  It can be as sweet as it wants, and it's never susceptible to attack by insects.  But I think we both know that there's a lot of insects that are great.  Like almost 97% of insects are beneficial to the plant somehow.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:26:18):**  But we're going to kill everything to get rid of that 3% that's actually damaging to  our crop.  Here at the garden that we grow, the last two years, we've bought like a giant box of  
**[0:26:34-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:26:34):**  ladybugs.  May and June, let them go.  Just let it like, I think, I think the one we got last year was like 10,000 ladybugs  
**[0:26:43-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:26:43):**  and it was basically a shoebox.  Yeah, cool, isn't it?  I think part of with me was one of the first books I read during this time frame was One  
**[0:26:58-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:26:58):**  Straw Revolution by Masanubu Fukuoka.  And you know, he really changed the way I look at things, the way I think about things.  And one of the quotes in his book was, there's no such thing as a good insect or a bad insect.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:27:11):**  They're just insects.  And I think when you think about that, and you think about what you just said, and what  we've been talking about for the last few minutes, you know, man has this thing about  
**[0:27:22-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:27:22):**  conquering nature.  That's all we've ever done is think we have to impose our will on nature, we have to have  a clean slate, we have to kill everything there, so that we can grow the one thing that  
**[0:27:32-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:27:32):**  we want.  And you know, what it boils down to is man swallowing his pride and working with nature,  and realizing that nature already has a near perfect system in place.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:27:45):**  And when you let her operate in her context, she's going to take care of it for you.  And we, we grow miles and miles and miles of corn.  Well, it's probably a pretty safe bet that there's going to be an insect that loves to  
**[0:27:58-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:27:58):**  eat corn is going to show up.  So, you know, the more you remove diversity, the more you remove diversity, and the only  insect left is the one that likes corn.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:28:08):**  So you know, we just got to think about this a little bigger picture.  And that was just part of the fun of, you know, the learning curve that I was on is  just watching all this farm coming back to the life.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:28:21):**  And you know, learning what ate what and it was just, it was just really cool and really  fun.  And, you know, and I think for me, during this timeframe, we, I'm starting to understand  
**[0:28:33-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:28:33):**  the predator prey relationship.  And I'm, you know, I'm embracing insects.  And, you know, for me as a grazer, you know, the one thing I wanted to see was dung beetles.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:28:41):**  I just couldn't wait.  You know, I remembered them as a kid, as a really young kid, seeing them on our farm,  and I hadn't seen them in decades.  
**[0:28:48-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:28:48):**  And lo and behold, two or three years after bring the cows back, and we quit using the  insecticides, the dung beetles returned.  And I remember walking out the door one day, and we just raised off past the house.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:00):**  And the cows have been gone about a week, and I went out to examine.  And every cow pie that I could find was flipped over.  And the dung beetle hole was, was caught up.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:10):**  I'm like, holy cow, something's eating my dung beetles.  And I just panic, you know, I did, wait a minute, I got into this for dung beetles.  And I go back in the house and I research.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:20):**  And do you know what the number one or what, what the one of the top predators of the dung  beetle is?  I actually I don't.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:27):**  Skunks.  Really?  And we had seen a huge influx of skunks around the farm that fall.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:33):**  And I'm like, you know, I didn't get into this to grow skunks.  I got into this group dung beetles.  I mean, this sucks.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:39):**  And so then I go, wait, wait a minute, Gail, the new you and I go back to the computer.  And I type in, you know, predators of skunks.  Owls.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:48):**  Okay, owl population had taken off too.  And I'm like, okay, I can live with this.  You know, I can give up a few dung beetles to bring some owls onto the farm.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:29:59):**  And so you know, again, it's just chill out, let Mother Nature deal with it.  There's there's ebbs and flows and it all cycles around and it all works.  That was a great bit that relationship about the skunks and the owls and the dung beetles.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:30:14):**  I've never heard that.  That's really interesting.  And I've noticed, I feel like dung beetles, like, it's been a while since I've seen a  
**[0:30:24-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:30:24):**  lot of dung beetle activity, like the rollers.  Almost every year, I'm never without tunnelers and burrowers, you know, the smaller ones  that dig the holes and they come up from the bottom.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:30:38):**  But the rollers, the ones that can deconstruct an entire pet in like 20 minutes, I haven't  seen those for two years.  And I'm not sure why I don't think it's any of the, maybe they've just moved on.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:30:54):**  Maybe they're just conditions weren't quite right.  I don't know.  Yeah, I could echo that.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:31:06):**  A little bit of mine is because I've moved to a new farm and we're back on a dead soil.  So we're having to reintroduce some things.  And so we did see higher counts of dung beetles across the board last year.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:31:18):**  But my last year on the prior farm in 2019, our counts were down a little bit.  And yeah, I didn't panic.  It could be environmental.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:31:26):**  It could be the weather.  We could have got drift from the neighbors.  You never know.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:31:32):**  But I am concerned.  There's just not enough of you and me out here.  And at the end of the day, there's a lot more pressure from insecticides and everything  
**[0:31:44-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:31:44):**  else.  It's getting tough for everything to survive, I'm afraid.  Does it seem like more people are coming around to the regenerative side faster?  
**[0:32:01-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:01):**  I guess has COVID accelerated people being more aware of what's in their food and what's  on their food?  That's probably a two-part question.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:12):**  I think the farmer side of that, yeah, I think they're coming around fast.  I know they're coming around faster.  We're seeing more and more interest.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:20):**  I think the farm economic crisis, whatever you want to call it, meltdown, certainly isn't  hurting that.  I think farmers are more receptive to whatever it takes to survive.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:32):**  And I think we're also seeing enough success stories.  You mentioned Michael Thompson.  There's just dozens of great farmers in Kansas, all corners doing fabulous things.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:40):**  And it's working.  And I think their neighbors are starting to see that.  So I think that's helping.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:46):**  I think at the end of the day, farmers truly are concerned with what their urban cousins  think of what they're doing to the environment.  And I think that comes into play.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:32:56):**  So yeah, it's happening a lot faster on the farmer side of it before we flip to the COVID  and the consumer side.  The disappointing part for me is on this latest generations and the farmers coming into region  
**[0:33:12-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:33:12):**  now, they're using cover crops faster and better.  And they're looking at implementing intercropping of cover crops with their cash crops.  But I don't know if I see the desire to get away from the chemicals fast enough.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:33:32):**  I agree.  And that scares me.  I see way too many guys calling themselves regen, posting on Facebook and talking about  
**[0:33:40-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:33:40):**  using this big witch's brew of chemicals to wipe out their cover crop to plant their cash  crop into.  And I'm like, I'm not saying we need to quit chemicals overnight cold turkey.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:33:51):**  That's a difficult thing to do.  But I'm not hearing the plans.  I've got five years to get rid of chemicals or I'm going to eliminate Roundup in two years  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:33:59):**  and this chemical insecticides in three years or whatever.  I'm not hearing that.  And that bothers me a lot.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:34:07):**  That's not what regenerative ag is about.  We just got to have the goal of eliminating and being truly regenerative.  On the customer and the COVID side, yeah, I think we had a fantastic window, especially  
**[0:34:19-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:34:19):**  when the lockdown set and we started seeing interruptions in the supply chain.  And customers suddenly started planting gardens and buying chickens and shopping local.  I think you and I washed with all shop Kansas farm almost had a meltdown in the early weeks  
**[0:34:36-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:34:36):**  because they couldn't keep up.  And that's all a really good thing.  It was like a full time job for somebody just to approve applications in that group for  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:34:46):**  a couple of weeks.  I'm glad that wasn't me.  And bless you whoever did that.  
**[0:34:51-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:34:51):**  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am too.  But I think we missed and part of it is probably because we weren't able to gather and we weren't.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:35:03):**  I don't know.  We had a really good opportunity to educate the consumers as to why it was important.  And not just because of the supply chain, but I think personally I'm of the total belief  
**[0:35:16-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:35:16):**  that COVID was a warning shot from Mother Nature.  Man's treatment of the environment and of the soil and water and air and the consumers,  the habits is what made COVID what it was.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:35:36):**  I mean, it's a really mild virus and there's no reason the environment in our systems didn't  just flush it through.  There was no reason for this to be something of concern.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:35:45):**  But because of the way we've degraded the environment and the soil and our immune systems,  it became much worse than it was.  And there's another virus coming that's going to be much, much worse.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:35:55):**  And if we don't change the way we grow and consume food and energy and fiber, it's going  to get a lot worse a lot faster.  We've got a lot of work to do to educate the consumers on why this is important.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:36:10):**  They're on Shop Kansas Farm or hitting the farmers markets more than they were, growing  their own food more than they were.  I'm remembering the words of Joel Salitan about how to create a pathogen friendly environment.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:36:26):**  And we've done it.  I mean, we do it.  We've done it in feedlots.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:36:29):**  We do it in chicken barns.  We do it in dense urban areas.  I mean, there's, I can go, I can look at a picture of New York City and all those giant  
**[0:36:40-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:36:40):**  tall buildings full of apartments and think that's just a CAFO for humans.  That's just a vertical CAFO for humans.  You fly over the suburbs.  
**[0:36:50-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:36:50):**  It's a horizontal CAFO for humans.  And we engineer these pathogen friendly environments by trying to sterilize everything.  But what we end up doing is we end up killing that 90 to 97% of the good bugs, of the good  
**[0:37:09-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:37:09):**  insects, of the good microbes, of the good bacteria, of the viruses that don't hurt us.  And then what we can't kill becomes even stronger.  And once it breaks free, just like we've seen with COVID, it breaks into an unlimited reservoir  
**[0:37:26-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:37:26):**  of 8 billion people and 8 billion chances to mutate into something worse.  I think we got lucky with COVID that it mutated into something that wasn't as bad, more transmissible,  but less severe.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:37:41):**  The worry is the next time a disease comes out of the wild, is it going to be like SARS,  like COVID, and is it going to end up being relatively mild?  Or is something really horrible going to come out like, I don't know, a variant of Marburg,  
**[0:37:58-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:37:58):**  hemorrhagic fever or variant of Ebola?  I don't even really want to talk about that kind of stuff because that's really pandemic.  That shut everything down immediately.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:38:10):**  COVID was a bad cold.

And in March of 2019, Zach Bush stood on the stage and said, we are primed on this planet  for something like a virus that's going to be a plague on humanity and the two places

I can't say that that lab in China in Wuhan had anything to do with this virus getting

We've passed that all on to other countries that either can't afford environmental stewardship

Yeah, I totally agree.  That's where the consumer side of this comes into play with regeneration is we've got to

We've become a society that is hell bent on convenience and cheap.

We do so at the cost of our own health.  Cheap food is food that is grown without nutrition and loaded with toxins.

One last side note to go back to square one and start over again.

From the early 70s through the early 2000s, every 10 years, the diversity on the farm

**[0:43:00-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:43:00):**  There's two herbicides, two suddenly insecticides, and then more fertility and micronutrients,  and then fungicides.

**[0:43:20-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:43:20):**  back on the farm with livestock, more diversity on our rotation and grain crops and cover  crops, and our reliance on inputs dropped drastically.  We just went full circle.

That was really good to see.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:43:51):**  By 2010, I'm feeling pretty bulletproof.  I'm flying all over the country speaking at conferences.  We're now past the cover cropping stage, not that we're past it, but we've got that figured

**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:00):**  She did.  The chicks show up.  I look down in the box.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:06):**  There's all these little white fluffy chicks.  Then there's about half of them are not.  There's all these fluffy chicks that are all different colors.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:14):**  I expected that of Lynette because she loves color.  She loves diversity.  I knew she probably bought one of each breed.

**[0:45:35-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:35):**  I'm like, I'll eat eggs, but now you're asking me to eat chicken?  This wasn't the deal.  This was not the deal at all.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:45):**  She's raising meat chickens.  It was weird because at the time we hadn't really never talked much about doing direct  marketing.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:45:58):**  We were never taught how to sell ourselves, tell our story, sell a product.  We were taught to go sell at the co-op.  Exactly.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:46:05):**  I was trained to haul my stuff to the co-op, bend over and take whatever they gave me.  I was supposed to smile about it with my $5 hat on the way out the door that they gave  me as a bonus.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:46:18):**  Neighbors were stopping in the yard and saying, hey, you have chickens.  The whole irony of somebody stopping in a farm yard and asking, you have chickens?  That might tell you we've gone a little too far the wrong way.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:46:33):**  They wanted to buy a dozen eggs.  They wanted to buy a chicken to eat.  Next thing I know, that's starting to sell chickens.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:46:41):**  Where we are today just started to blow up then out of an accident.  Out of accidentally buying chickens because they were on sale.  I can believe that.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:46:55):**  We start with some chickens and cowboy Gale doesn't like the chickens.  Now we have sheep, goats, pigs, ducks and everything else.  How did we get there, Gale?  
**[0:47:09-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:47:09):**  How did we get there, cowboy Gale?  I was just going to say, and it got even better because in 2011, one year later, she came  to me and she goes, we need some sheep.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:47:20):**  You got away with chickens, but you're asking a lot out of a cowboy now to bring sheep on  the farm.  She kept it up and kept talking about it.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:47:31):**  By now, I'm starting to understand that for me to put my money where my mouth is, I'm  talking about diversity of crops.  I'm growing all these different grain crops.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:47:41):**  We're now growing for grain crops mung beans and cow peas and barley alongside wheat and  corn and soybeans.  We're growing sunflowers and Milo again.  
**[0:47:52-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:47:52):**  I'm promoting 20, 30 way mixes.  We're now planting 100 way mixes of cover crops on the farm.  All I got are cows.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:05):**  It's time to put your money where your mouth is.  In studying sheep, they are a ruminant, but they graze differently than cows.  Their manure is a different CN ratio of cows.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:16):**  Everything about them says I'm not a cow.  It just made sense.  They eat things that cows didn't necessarily like.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:27):**  During my research and meeting guys like Greg Judy, I found out I can bring so many sheep  on the farm and not have to sell a single cow.  Kind of stupid not to, isn't it?  
**[0:48:40-0:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:40):**  We bring in the sheep.  Lo and behold, I'd eaten lamb a few times in my life, but it was grain finished lamb.  It tasted like mutton.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:51):**  It tasted like sheep.  I ate it.  It was okay.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:48:56):**  I didn't ask for seconds, but when we took our first bite of grass finished lamb, it's  as good as any ribeye I've ever eaten.  We fell in love with the meat.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:49:07):**  We found out that once we learn not to treat the sheep like cows, that they're very easy  to manage.  They're also much more profitable than cows.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:49:20):**  The old saying about I have cows for sex appeal and sheep to pay the note.  That's completely true.  I think I heard it on Clay Connery's podcast that they say they keep the horses up front  
**[0:49:31-0:49:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:49:31):**  for the tourists, the cows around the house for the neighbors and the sheep are out back  paying for everything.  Yep.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:49:39):**  Spot on.  Okay.  So we've got sheep, we've got chickens, still farming a bunch of acres.  
**[0:49:48-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:49:48):**  And I'm curious as to how you made the transition from where you were then to where you are  now.  By this point in time, by 2011 and 12, I'm probably 1800, 2000 acres.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:01):**  We had downsized some.  We'd had some ground sole that we couldn't afford to buy.  And we knew we wanted to downsize as we brought the cattle in also because we just didn't  
**[0:50:10-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:10):**  need the crop land anymore.  I went to the Grass Fed Exchange Conference.  It was actually in Bismarck, North Dakota that year.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:19):**  And I went, Lynette and I decided to grass finish our first beef just to see if we could  do it.  And I went up there basically to learn how to grass finish but also to find a market.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:33):**  And at that point in time, I was going to be the guy selling semi loads of grass finished  beef to whoever the Tyson of the grass finished world was.  That was my whole goal.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:44):**  You know, with 1800 acres of cover crops, I could grass finish a lot of beef.  So I thought.  It sounded good on paper.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:50:52):**  It sounded good on paper.  It looked good on paper.  But I got to the meeting and there was a farmer panel.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:01):**  And that's where I found out that at that time that almost everybody grass finishing  beef at least north of I-70 was feeding some grain and grazing corn stalks.  And I stood up and asked the question, you know, I'm new to this, but as a consumer,  
**[0:51:22-0:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:22):**  and we're by now we're direct marketing some chicken and stuff to consumers and people  are asking about beef.  And I'm thinking, you know, I'm just under the impression that all my customers think  
**[0:51:31-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:31):**  that grass finish means organic grass finished.  Every day on pasture.  Every day on pasture.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:40):**  And one of the panelists, farmers says, you know, to grass finish this far north, we've  just, we've got to have a little energy in the winter.  We've got to feed a little bit of grain.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:50):**  It's not much.  And he also made the comment.  He goes, it's more to me about marketing.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:51:56):**  And I believe I'm a guy that can sell ice to Eskimos.  That's a problem.  That's a problem.

And by the time they got everybody calmed down and they finished the panel, I went out  the door.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:52:20):**  I'm on the phone.  This is also probably something we'll be talking about in a minute, but I had also found Don  Huber at the time started to understand about Roundup glyphosate GMOs.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:52:30):**  We were trying to get away from that anyway.  And I called Lynette going out the door.  I'm livid.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:52:38):**  And I said, this is what's going on.  I said, I'm not going to be a part of any of these labels.  We're going to have to get small and market our own product because this ship is going  
**[0:52:46-0:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:52:46):**  to sink.  And I'm not going to be on the Titanic when it does.  I get that.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:52:53):**  I, I can see that, you know, like we were talking about earlier, these, these terms  regenerative such high danger of being co-opted.  Like the last thing we want is a company like Cargill or Monsanto coming out and starting  
**[0:53:08-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:53:08):**  to co-opt and greenwash the term regenerative.  I don't think that, I don't think they really understand what it is, what regenerative is.  I think they're just seeing dollar signs and trying to cash in on a label.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:53:24):**  And I agree with you.  They're, they're, go ahead.  We're already seeing, I mean, Regen is already being greenwashed by these companies and others.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:53:33):**  I mean, you've got Country Crock trying to sell Regen margarine.  Margarine's an industrial by-product.  That's not food.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:53:47):**  Pretty hard to make something that's one molecule away from plastic regenerative at any level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:53:54):**  And I think at the end of the day, that's, that's kind of what it comes down to is, you  know, these inputs, if we're going to talk about being regenerative, you talked about  carbon.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:04):**  Okay.  And you know, my dad and you know, for years, he's been saying calories consumed calories  produced.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:14):**  And that basically is the essence of the carbon equation.  How much food can we produce?  What does that worth in BTU's or calories?  
**[0:54:23-0:54:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:23):**  And then how much energy did it take to produce that in BTU's or in calories?  I mean, there's all scientific units, energy is energy.  The BTU is a BTU.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:32):**  It doesn't matter if it's stored in the muscle cells of a cow or if it's in fossil fuels,  BTU's or BTU's.  So when can we start looking at the carbon cost of our protein?  
**[0:54:45-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:45):**  Cause that's, that's what it has to come down to is what is the carbon cost of our protein?  And I think the big money, the wall street money would like us to think that that's in  a plant-based diet.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:54:59):**  And I think you and I can both know that that plant-based diet, that's going to make all  these, you know, meat-free patties and you know, meat-free chicken nuggets.  That's monoculture farming.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:55:12):**  That's heavy industrial processing.  That's toxic chemical industrial processes to make all these byproducts that they need  for flavoring and like these things like soy hemoglobin.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:55:25):**  I can't even remember what it's called, but one of the things they're not even recognized  as safe to consume by the FDA.  They're still kind of under a trial period.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:55:37):**  And people think it's good to eat like beyond meat.  They had their IPO was huge.  They made so much money and here guys like you and I are, we're like struggling to feed  
**[0:55:47-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:55:47):**  our cows every day struggling against the poor cattle market.  Well, you're not because you're direct marketing.  I'll get there someday.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:55:55):**  So yeah, there's a lot of danger in hitching your wagon to a label like grass fed.  And the truth of it is just like what you're doing with Circle 7, connecting the consumer  directly with their food and being open and transparent about how you produce that food.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:56:19):**  Yeah, so that was where we went from there was we had to learn how to tell our story.  We had to learn how to market.  We had to learn a new lingo and we were completely blown away.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:56:33):**  At this point in time, we're not organic yet.  Our farm is far from perfect, not that there's any such thing as a perfect farm.  But what we found was the consumers that we contacted didn't care how imperfect we were.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:56:52):**  They wanted to see our faces.  They wanted to be able to give us a hug.  They wanted to come see the farm.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:56:57):**  They wanted to hear the words.  We care about our farm.  We care about your kids' future on this planet.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:57:05):**  We care about the environment.  We care about the air and the water.  They wanted a face on their food.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:57:10):**  That's what they wanted.  They wanted to hear our story that we were trying to change and that we were trying to  do things better.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:57:17):**  And I talked earlier about how farmers have purposely been kept in the dark and never  taught how to tell their story.  We've never been empowered.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:57:30):**  And for the first year, excuse me, for the first year that I was direct marketing, I  struggled to look my customers in the eye when I gave them their total for their purchase  because this was so much more than I'd ever received for any product.  
**[0:57:48-0:58:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:57:48):**  And even though I totally believed in the product, my confidence probably still wasn't  there enough yet to be able to look them in the eye of a total confidence knowing that  the value is in this product because I'd just been brainwashed to the point of thinking  
**[0:58:02-0:58:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:58:02):**  that my product is worth commodity price only.  And it's not, unlike we talked about earlier, it's not worth commodity price because you're  not externalizing your costs.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:58:13):**  You're being upfront and you're being transparent about your environmental impacts, your ecological  impacts and the way you live your life.  And I'm not being subsidized.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:58:29):**  You're one of those guys like me that avoids the FSA office like it's a place that, wow,  I kind of jumped to three different things and I never did decide on one, but yeah, FSA  office, place you avoid like the plague, don't want to go.  
**[0:58:49-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:58:49):**  They probably don't even know who I am in there anymore.  And I think that's fine.  Yeah, I don't miss that part of farming at all.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:59:04):**  Part of my realization along the line there in the early 2000s when we were contemplating  change is grain farming in Kansas, there was two things that I needed to make the year  successful, rainfall in August and government check.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:59:23):**  And when as a farmer, I've got the two things that dictate my year, the number one and two  things that dictate my year, two things out of my control, I might be in the wrong line  of work.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:59:34):**  Yeah.  And rain in August, we don't really get much usually.  And if you don't get any in August, it's awful hard to grow a wheat crop off hard to get  
**[0:59:47-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=0:59:47):**  that.  Yeah, so keep walking me through your journey of downsizing your size and increasing your  diversity.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:00:05):**  So it was about this time, two other things happened in 2011 and 2012 besides us looking  into marketing.  And so when I left Bismark, Lynette and I were already starting to chart the course  
**[1:00:19-1:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:00:19):**  that we were going to have to get smaller, that there's no way I could direct market  eight or 10 semi loads of grass finished beef.  Even now finding outlets for that much is, you really can't.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:00:34):**  Nope.  Yeah, sadly, that's the next thing we've got to address with regen.  And that's probably a topic for another conversation of what we're wanting to do with Great Plains  
**[1:00:44-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:00:44):**  regeneration.  But so we knew we had to downsize.  We thought the profit potential was there that we could downsize greatly.  
**[1:00:52-1:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:00:52):**  Also, I being an early adopter of no-till and the first person in Kansas to start planting  cover crops.  And because of the way I was farming in the late 90s and early 2000s, the downside was  
**[1:01:05-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:01:05):**  I was probably using as much or more Roundup than the next 10 farmers below me combined.  So with that, I also became the first farm to start having Roundup resistant weeds.  Before we really knew what was going on, we just, we had no clue why Roundup went from  
**[1:01:23-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:01:23):**  being the savior of just perfectly golf course looking manicured fields with nothing growing  besides soybeans to fields that were full of weeds.  And it's happened really rapidly.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:01:34):**  And I had already started hearing rumors about what glyphosate was and that there could be  some issues.  But I asked my team members and they all gave me the pat on the back.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:01:48):**  My team members being my bank, my agronomist, seed sales people, extension agents.  They all gave me the...  Guys that really have your back at the end of the day.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:01:59):**  Yeah.  We got you.  We got all those tree hugging environmentalist hippies out in California.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:04):**  They don't know squat.  But also because I was speaking at conferences, I was running into scientists that had left  the system and they had other stories to tell.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:18):**  And I remember I went to a no till on the plains event in Nebraska one winter, Joe Claperton  was speaking and there was a snowstorm that day.  And there was, I think there was three of us showed up period.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:32):**  And there was a couple of sponsors in the room.  Ray Ward was in the room with Ford labs and she walks out and she goes, wow, we were afraid  the snow was gonna hurt us.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:40):**  She goes, you know what?  There's something I've been wanting to get off my chest.  If you guys are okay with it, can we change the topic for the day?  
**[1:02:49-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:49):**  And we said, what do you got in mind?  She goes, I wanna talk about glyphosate.  And my hero who was Joe Claperton at the time spent the next six or seven hours telling  
**[1:02:58-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:02:58):**  me everything that she had been learning about glyphosate.  And I had a extremely long drive home.  What are the cliff notes?  
**[1:03:11-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:11):**  That there, it was doing more harm than good.  There was issues with human health.  There was all these things that we've been hearing out of the hippies.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:18):**  And she mentioned a guy named Don Huber who was doing a lot of the research.  And I came home and started researching Don Huber, looking up his articles, his research  papers.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:28):**  And I found a podcast that he did.  It was a two hour podcast.  And for anybody that hasn't listened to Don Huber, it is literally drinking out of a fire  
**[1:03:36-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:36):**  hose.  I mean, the man throws so much stuff.  And I can remember talking with Gabe Brown a couple of times because he was in the same  
**[1:03:44-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:44):**  boat as I was in at the time.  And he had heard of Huber and we just kept thinking, there's no way this can be true.  And there's just, this guy's got an axe to grind, but we kept thinking, you know, if  
**[1:03:55-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:03:55):**  one 10th of what he says is true, this is bad.  And this one particular podcast, I listened to it five or six times.  It was so full of information.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:04:04):**  I could never get it all in, but I knew there was something there was missing.  And one night, it was about 1130 at night, I'm listening to it.  And I heard him say that glyphosate was an antibiotic.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:04:18):**  And as a student of soil health, and a guy that was suddenly trying to grow soil microbes,  spraying my ground once, twice, three times a year with an antibiotic didn't seem like  a very good thing.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:04:33):**  And Lynette, by this point in time, you know, Lynette is full blown into researching human  health.  I'm full blown into researching soil health.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:04:41):**  And I would come home from conferences after spending a couple days with people like David  Brand and Chris Nichols and Christine Jones and Joe Clapperton and Ray Archuleta.  And my conversation with Lynette's would parallel, you know, what she's reading about the human  
**[1:04:55-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:04:55):**  gut and, and human health and the talk is almost identical.  And so, you know, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that night that spraying an antibiotic  on my ground on my crop and then putting that food in my gut.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:05:10):**  It all just came full circle and I didn't sleep for two days.  I literally cried for about 30 minutes that night.  I called both my kids the next morning.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:05:22):**  First thing and apologize to them for everything I've done as a farmer for the previous 10  years.  Wow.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:05:31):**  And I, you know, I swore off Roundup and as a farmer to quit using glyphosate.  It's not very easy.  And I think that's part of the reason that it is still hanging around too much in the  
**[1:05:44-1:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:05:44):**  region world today.  But after meeting Don Huber and others now that are coming out, there is no room in food  production for glyphosate period.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:05:59):**  And can you expand on that a little more on why?  Well, I mean, the fact that it's an antibiotic and you, you mentioned earlier about us,  cleansing the system with antibiotic soaps and we're living in a clean world.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:06:15):**  Well, I don't care.  Companies like Subway talk about their sandwiches or antibiotic arrays with antibiotic free  animals.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:06:23):**  That's BS because if they're eating corn and soy that's Roundup ready, that's grains loaded  with antibiotics and that's going through our guts.  And that explains, you know, when you start breaking down the gut barrier,  
**[1:06:41-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:06:41):**  Start talking about autoimmune disease and all kinds of fun stuff.  Plus the lack of nutrient density and the grain and the fruits and the vegetables and  the livestock.  
**[1:06:50-1:07:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:06:50):**  Now we've got rampant autoimmune, cancer, diabetes, obesity.  All of these are just skyrocketing.  Is glyphosate the reason?  
**[1:07:00-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:07:00):**  It's not the only reason.  No, but it's a large piece of the puzzle.  I agree.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:07:06):**  And you know, you can take and lay down graphs of, you know, pesticide use, herbicide use,  synthetic fertilizer use, lay that against a graph of food production.  You can lay that against a graph of heart disease.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:07:22):**  You can lay that against a graph of diabetes.  You can lay that against all kinds of graphs and scarily, they all match up.  Now correlation does not necessarily mean causation.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:07:36):**  I think that like the soil health debacle that we've created by using synthetic fertilizer  and chemicals like Roundup, we're going to pay that bill someday.  We're going to pay that bill for the lack of fertility.  
**[1:07:52-1:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:07:52):**  We're going to pay that bill for using these chemicals like Roundup that are incredibly  toxic to soil microbiology.  And by extension, we're just walking bags of microbes.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:08:06):**  Our mutual friend, Matt Cleffer says that all the time, just a walking bag of microbes  and we're eating food that's constantly being sprayed with antibiotics or we're  eating food that eats stuff that's been sprayed with antibiotics.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:08:24):**  And it's almost like, I guess I want to say mainstream science is completely against  the idea that any of these residues from glyphosate make it into the corn, make it into the meat  and actually affect us from eating the meat, from that second, third, fourth order effect  
**[1:08:47-1:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:08:47):**  from the glyphosate.  I think it does.  But getting that to be proven is going to be really hard.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:08:56):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  The other thing that we haven't talked about yet is there's been little, if any, research  done yet on what happens now when you add 2,4-D to the glyphosate, when you add dicamba  
**[1:09:09-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:09:09):**  to the glyphosate, when you add neonicotinoids and all of these other chemicals and toxins  to the glyphosate.  And all the scientists I've talked to across the board say that research has not been done,  
**[1:09:25-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:09:25):**  but I promise you one plus one does not equal two.  We're going to see these effects go up exponentially as we tank mix these chemicals together and  then put them in our guts.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:09:38):**  I was sitting here thinking more about Roundup and the specific biological pathway that it  uses.  And maybe I know you've listened to a lot of Fred Provenza and Zach Bush and I think  
**[1:09:53-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:09:53):**  this is where I got this from.  But the specific pathway that Roundup inhibits has something to do with the binding of zinc  within a cell.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:10:05):**  Is that what you remember?  Yep, that's a little bit of it.  And zinc is one of those nutrients that's very critical for immune system function.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:10:16):**  So if we're inhibiting a plant's ability to bind zinc in the cell or to utilize zinc in  the cell, we're reducing its ability, its immune system.  And we're the same.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:10:31):**  We're all made up of the same stuff just arranged slightly differently.  Plants are the same.  We're the same.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:10:38):**  The same biological pathways and biochemical biochemical pathways that exist on a plant,  some of those exist in a human being.  The question I really have is, is glyphosate buildup in the body affecting our body's abilities  
**[1:10:55-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:10:55):**  to bind zinc and therefore lowering our immune response?  I'm not the person to ask that.  My opinion would be yes, absolutely.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:11:08):**  And we do know on that subject, glyphosate is a chelator of minerals when you use it  in soybeans or on the soil or whatever.  Zinc is one of those minerals that it chelates in the soil.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:11:22):**  So the soybeans that are coming off, the corn that is coming off, seeing heavy rates of  glyphosate, they're most likely going to be low in levels of zinc.  Another one that it chelates is magnesium, manganese.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:11:37):**  We're now talking about minerals that could be slightly important in reproduction.  And obviously phosphorus would be another one being glyphosate, but there's a host of  minerals that it is chelating in the soil, not allowing it into the plant.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:11:55):**  It's got to be chelating it in our bodies.  Not that the food we're eating has much zinc or magnesium or manganese in it anyway, but  if there is, it could be being chelated, yeah.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:12:09):**  That brings to mind when I was a much, much younger man about when you're getting out  of college and buying your first farm.  I was raised on wheat bread, on whole wheat bread and whole wheat bread, late 70s, early  
**[1:12:24-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:12:24):**  80s.  I mean, it was dark.  It had some texture to it.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:12:27):**  I mean, it definitely, it wasn't like the whole wheat bread you're going to find in  the store now, like probably in the same label and bag.  I never knew white bread existed until I went to kindergarten.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:12:39):**  I had wheat bread with good cheese, good meat and garden vegetables on it because my parents  had a garden here.  Never seen white bread until I went to preschool and I go to preschool or kindergarten, first  
**[1:12:54-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:12:54):**  time we had to bring them a sack lunch and I see these other kids eating peanut butter  and jelly sandwiches on white bread.  I didn't know what I was missing for about six months and then I got to go to a friend's  
**[1:13:07-1:13:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:07):**  house and I had white bread for the first time.  I was like, oh my God, this is so delicious.  Then a little while later I asked my mom, I said, mom, why can't we have white bread?  
**[1:13:16-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:16):**  It tastes so much better.  She said, it tastes better because it's full of sugar.  We eat whole wheat bread because they leave the germ on it and that's where all the good  
**[1:13:24-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:24):**  stuff is.  That's where all the vitamins and minerals and nutrients, that's where they really are  and that's the stuff you need to eat.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:30):**  Eating bread without that is kind of pointless.  Then enriched bread, enriched flour started to be a thing.  We had this wonderful whole wheat, now we're going to mill the germ off of it so it's nice  
**[1:13:43-1:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:43):**  and pretty white.  But then in order to make it healthy for you again, we're going to go ahead and enrich  it and add all those vitamins back in.  
**[1:13:50-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:13:50):**  But they're not adding back in the vitamins they took out.  They're adding back in the same vitamins but probably from a different source that's not  bioavailable like it would be if it was still attached in the wheat germ.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:14:04):**  That trend has just continued.  We talked about a couple of weeks ago on the podcast about similarly how animal science  has given us the CAFO and the chicken barn and the hog house.  
**[1:14:18-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:14:18):**  Food science has taken everything we eat or that we want to eat, take everything good  out of it, put absolute cheapest crap in it to make it taste like what you think it should  be.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:14:32):**  I think about labels on packages.  You sell direct and it's a pain in the butt to get a label for your meat.  If these companies, these mega food conglomerates that are feeding us toxic crap, they spend  
**[1:14:52-1:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:14:52):**  millions of dollars a year on marketing to find the right color combinations, to find  the right shapes and the right words to use to appeal to somebody to get into buy that  product.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:15:04):**  I guess the point that I'm making is the more claims that product makes about how good it  is for you, the inverse is most likely true.  If you go buy one of those energy like a protein bar at the convenience store, 14 grams of  
**[1:15:23-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:15:23):**  protein, this many vitamins and minerals, this much, all the stuff you need for a day,  basically a meal replacement, then you start reading the label and reading the ingredients.  It gets kind of scary because there's a bunch of crap on there you can't pronounce.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:15:38):**  I think that the more the label claims to be healthy and flashy and the more claims  the label is making, probably the less I want to put that in my body.  Does your body recognize that protein bar as food?  
**[1:15:54-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:15:54):**  I use the analogy, does grandma recognize it as food?  If grandma doesn't recognize it as food, I'm probably not going to eat it.  My grandma used Olio and margarine, so maybe that might not be the best judge.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:16:08):**  My grandma is older than that, so I was lucky.  Maybe in your case, it's your great grandma.  Does your great grandma recognize it as food?  
**[1:16:18-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:16:18):**  That would probably be a much, much better judge if great grandmother would recognize  it.  We still haven't got to the point where you move farms.  
**[1:16:33-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:16:33):**  In 2012, besides all of this other excitement that we had going on, it was the second hottest,  second driest year on record since 1936.  In the fall of that year, with all of our crops being zeros like everybody else's, my  
**[1:16:54-1:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:16:54):**  crop insurance was denied my claims.  I think everybody's already heard this story, so I'll just hit the cliff notes.  I have heard it.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:17:05):**  I was denied my claims in the fall because I didn't manage my cover crops.  Basically, I didn't manage the termination of my cover crops properly.  Two months later, thanks to No-Till No Plains and Brian Lindley, he got me in touch with  
**[1:17:24-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:17:24):**  National Wildlife Federation and Ryan Stockwell.  He flew Jill Clapperton and I to Washington, D.C., where we got to meet with the heads  of the ag committees on the Democratic and Republican sides with their staffers.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:17:38):**  We didn't get to meet with the Congressman, which at the time was Steven out Michigan  and Lucas of Oklahoma.  We also met with Roberts and Moran's offices.  
**[1:17:47-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:17:47):**  We met with the NRCS chief, the head of RMA, which is federal crop insurance.  A bit of a wake up call there meeting your liberal and conservative congressional people  and finding out they really don't give a flip about you, that it's all about them.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:18:08):**  That's a whole other podcast there.  We jumped through all the hoops.  You have to play by their rules.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:18:17):**  We did all that.  They denied our request for mediation, which forced us into arbitration.  There was a date set.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:18:25):**  We put together our defense.  This is pretty similar to a court case now.  They set the date for the hearing of April 1, 2014.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:18:37):**  It was denied in October of 2012, just to let you know how long this takes, because  they think at some point you'll just give up and walk away.  In April of 2013, we realized we weren't going to have an answer by the growing season of  
**[1:18:56-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:18:56):**  2013, and my bank had no option but to call my line of credit because I didn't have crop  insurance to back myself up that year.  So I'm farming almost 2,000 acres and no operating line, no way to buy seed, fuel, chemicals,  
**[1:19:13-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:19:13):**  tires, labor, whatever.  That's a little scary.  That was a little scary.  
**[1:19:19-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:19:19):**  It was a long summer.  I had a lot of friends who brought me a pallet of seed, a pallet of chemical, said, here's  this.  
**[1:19:28-1:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:19:28):**  Pay me back when you can.  Somehow we found a way to put in a crop, but it was 60 days late getting it done.  We were still dry.  
**[1:19:38-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:19:38):**  It was a disaster.  My harvest that year is pretty much zero, plus the fact that I'm now adding 10 hours  a week to building my defense.  
**[1:19:50-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:19:50):**  So 10 hours a week for a farmer, I couldn't take 10 hours a week away from the farm, which  meant I took 10 hours a week away from the family.  So we got into the late winter, early spring of 2014.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:20:07):**  I'm now basically bankrupt.  We're almost to arbitration date.  And we started getting wind in the emails and disclosing evidence back and forth between  
**[1:20:18-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:20:18):**  the two parties.  They started sounding like they were changing their cause of denial.  So we rapidly had to put together a second defense.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:20:28):**  We get into the arbitration, which again is on April 1st, which is April Fool's Day.  Nothing was lost on that, the date they chose for this.  And we get into arbitration and sure enough, they changed their cause of denial in the  
**[1:20:41-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:20:41):**  arbitration hearing.  In the middle of it with no notice.  With no notice other than Ryan and I sniffing it out in the emails.  
**[1:20:53-1:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:20:53):**  So we presented our original case for their cause of denial.  We presented our defense for their new cause of denial.  Plus we presented a third case that they, by their own rules, can't change cause of

**[1:21:22-1:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:21:22):**  I won't even share, well I can't share with you some of the extremely stupid questions  that were asked of us during that hearing.  Because obviously I can't talk about it.  
**[1:21:34-1:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:21:34):**  So a few weeks later we got verdict that we want all three cases, all three defenses.  They got their hands slapped for not following their own rules that they established.  I was allowed to get my money out of them.  
**[1:21:53-1:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:21:53):**  I asked for interest which was denied.  And I then found out that I also couldn't sue them for damages.  Because we had went through arbitration.  
**[1:22:07-1:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:22:07):**  And so that kind of soured me from wanting to participate in federal programs.  I can imagine.  The upside was because of our trip to Washington DC and the media attention that we got through  
**[1:22:20-1:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:22:20):**  my trial, NRCS went to bad.  And they sat down with federal crop insurance.  And the rules were rewritten.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:22:30):**  There was a lot of things changed.  It certainly wasn't a great system but it was a step in the right direction.  Sadly I come out of this hemorrhaging so bad that we could never survive.  
**[1:22:47-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:22:47):**  And trying to farm like that, it didn't take long to go from 1,800 acres to 400 either  us giving up land or landowners taking land away from me because I was no longer farming  it in their best interest.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:00):**  Without having money to operate, pretty hard to get a crop planted timely, my cow crop  became my operating line of defense.  If I needed seed, I had to sell some cows.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:10):**  That meant the sale was on Wednesday, I had to have cows loaded on Tuesday.  If anything went wrong, I had to wait a week.  And the seed had to wait a week.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:22):**  That's not an optimal way to run a farm.  So it was pretty easy to get to 1,800 acres down to the 400 acre where we ended up in  2018.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:36):**  From there, my debt was too big for us to service with 400 acres in direct marketing.  I knew that.  I had to convince Lynette of that.  
**[1:23:45-1:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:45):**  She still had sadly too much confidence in me.  And I had to really have a tough discussion with her.  That's a great thing she had that much confidence in me.  
**[1:23:57-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:23:57):**  But it made the conversation that much tougher.  And unfortunately, between my divorce and the loss of the crop insurance, my parents  had co-signed on my notes, which meant their farm was now in jeopardy, which meant my brother's  
**[1:24:10-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:24:10):**  farm could be in jeopardy.  We had to work our way through all of that before we could sell out and make the move.  Okay.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:24:19):**  I won't make you get into too much more of that.  So what's the farm look like now?  So now in 2019, I sold my house.  
**[1:24:34-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:24:34):**  We did not get the debt completely removed.  We didn't quite get to where we wanted to be.  We weren't going to that.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:24:39):**  There was other things that come into play there.  But we got it whittled down enough.  We were able to use a 1031 exchange on the taxes and bought a 160 acre food forest beautiful  
**[1:24:52-1:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:24:52):**  farm on the edge of the Flint Hills in Greenwood County, Kansas.  I moved an hour away from my roots, my home, what I thought was my future, my blood, sweat,  and tears.  
**[1:25:06-1:25:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:25:06):**  That was not an easy thing to do.  Farmers don't move, they don't leave.  But at the age of 57, I packed up my stuff in a stock trailer and moved south.  
**[1:25:21-1:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:25:21):**  The new farm, it's another sharp learning curve.  We've got a small orchard on the farm.  We've got some apple trees, plum trees, apricots, peaches, pears, pigs, persimmons, nuts.  
**[1:25:36-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:25:36):**  We got greenhouse, hoop house, huge garden area, seven ponds.  For a river flatlander, moving to the Flint Hills to an orchard was a whole new learning  curve that I wasn't quite ready for probably.  
**[1:25:54-1:26:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:25:54):**  What's your favorite fruit to grow so far?  Well, you probably just took us down our next rabbit hole because we have now been here  two years.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:03):**  We have picked six peaches.  We've had late freezes, polar vortexes.  We did harvest some apples last year and a few plums.  
**[1:26:12-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:12):**  By and large, we've had zero production of pears, apricots, and peaches.  Very minor production of figs and persimmons.  We've had one variety of plums that still hasn't produced in two years.  
**[1:26:28-1:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:28):**  I don't care whether we can argue all day about man-made or not, but climate change  is real.  It is here.  
**[1:26:34-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:34):**  It's not coming.  It's here now.  It is affecting the way we're growing food.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:39):**  One hundred percent.  Which way do you think the climate is changing?  I thought because I bought into climate change before most of my neighbors and friends did  
**[1:26:51-1:27:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:26:51):**  that I could beat it.  I could maybe at least get ahead of it and compete.  Ten years ago, I started looking at Texas and Oklahoma.  
**[1:27:03-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:27:03):**  I thought it kept getting called global warming.  As we decertify and become warmer, I need to look at more crops like grain sorghum as  a cash cropper.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:27:14):**  What's it like hotter and drier from me?  Exactly.  What's a longer growing season look like with warmer daytime temperatures, less rainfall?  
**[1:27:25-1:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:27:25):**  That was another good thing about bringing in the sheep.  They're much more drought resilient, drought hardy than cows are.  I was breaking my arm, patting myself on the back for being on the front side of this.  
**[1:27:39-1:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:27:39):**  What climate change is for me is wild temperature swings.  We're going from Texas to North Dakota in 36 hours.  Do I need to be buying apple trees and vegetables that can handle Texas or North Dakota?  
**[1:27:58-1:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:27:58):**  What I think we need is some that can handle both.  That's pretty difficult to find.  Heat freezes, rainfall events, we talked about the rainfall probably before we started.  
**[1:28:11-1:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:28:11):**  We recorded zero precipitation in January, three tenths in December, zero in November.  The next time it rains, we may get five or ten inches.  This is our new normal.  
**[1:28:24-1:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:28:24):**  It's feast or famine literally with temperatures, with wind, with precipitation.  We've got to find a way to grow food in this.  You've been farming for 40 years and as a farmer, you have to be an observer of the  
**[1:28:37-1:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:28:37):**  weather.  I've been back around for about 15 years.  I remember in late 2006 or maybe it was 2007, I went to a meeting and I got to hear a young  
**[1:28:52-1:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:28:52):**  man from a National Weather Service office down in Norman.  He basically said what we've been talking about, climate change is real.  We don't need to argue if it's manmade or not.  
**[1:29:05-1:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:29:05):**  We're having an effect.  The climate is changing.  Those two things are facts, cannot be argued with.  
**[1:29:12-1:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:29:12):**  But what I think this young man's name was Andrew.  What I remember him saying was the extremes will get more extreme.  As the climate enters a period of change, the extremes will get more extreme.  
**[1:29:27-1:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:29:27):**  We're not going to say it's warming anymore.  We're just going to say it's changing.  We don't know if it's going to get hotter, drier, cooler, or wetter, or what combinations  
**[1:29:36-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:29:36):**  it's going to be.  But we do know that in the near term, the extremes are going to get more extreme and  things are going to change.  
**[1:29:44-1:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:29:44):**  There's going to be a lot of disruption in the system before it settles down to another  relatively long period of quiet climate.  I think that climate period, 70, 80 years that we may have a stable climate with reasonably  
**[1:30:00-1:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:00):**  predictable drought cycle.  Then we get into a situation like we're in now, where I think it's like a compound  of the natural climate shift plus manmade climate effects are coming to a head and they're  
**[1:30:14-1:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:14):**  driving the climate to change much, much more rapid than it ever has.  I think the planet is struggling to find the balance to bring herself back into balance.  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[1:30:28-1:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:28):**  I'm going to butcher this because I'm not sure the proper pronunciation, but what did  we have in mid-December?  Is that Dureco or Derecho that we had on December 16th?  
**[1:30:38-1:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:38):**  In inland hurricane?  We had one of those in the early 80s.  I remember that because I had just gotten married and we had just bought a new car that  
**[1:30:48-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:48):**  was pretty well destroyed in it.  I don't remember another one.  We had one in 2009.  
**[1:30:56-1:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:30:56):**  We had one a year and a half ago.  We've now had three of them in 10 years.  We've pretty much had three of them this year or three of them in the last year here.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:07):**  You've got bomb cyclones.  We never knew what those were.  Nebraska has two of them in seven weeks, a year and a half ago or two years ago.  
**[1:31:18-1:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:18):**  I think we're looking at scaling up hurricanes and tornadoes.  I don't think F5s are going to be big enough in the coming months to measure how big the  tornadoes are.  
**[1:31:28-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:28):**  We're already seeing hurricanes.  Each one is bigger than the last.  I think things like this are just going to continue to get worse.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:35):**  The wild temperature swings have been the real issue for us.  I think what we've been talking about for the last hour with soil health, if my rainfall  events are going to be five or 10 inches at a time, I damn sure better have some way to  
**[1:31:49-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:49):**  capture that.  My prior system couldn't come close.  I don't know if I could catch six inches an hour, but I damn sure like to try.  
**[1:31:59-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:31:59):**  I've got some good pastures that could probably catch that.  I think you'd be surprised.  In 2014 or 2015, NRCS did some work on my old farm.  
**[1:32:13-1:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:32:13):**  We actually went out and measured some of my worst soils, some of my higher clay soils.  We were at six and a half inches an hour infiltration then, which was six inches an hour higher  than we were 14 years prior.  
**[1:32:23-1:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:32:23):**  I was going to say that's after a lot of cover cropping and some livestock integration and  no till.  I think we can get there, but we've got to change some of our habits.  
**[1:32:37-1:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:32:37):**  It's doable.  You're certainly doing the work.  Obviously your environment, your soil is different than mine.  
**[1:32:46-1:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:32:46):**  I don't know what you could have done historically 100 or 200 years ago.  Comparing my operation to yours is like comparing apples to oranges.  Right.  
**[1:32:57-1:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:32:57):**  We're a lot sandier soil out here.  As far as what it was 120 years ago, I'd say we're pretty close to that.  I think that the historic potential for forage production and rainfall infiltration, I think  
**[1:33:17-1:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:33:17):**  I'm pretty close to the maximum on the ranch.  It's just utilizing what I know how to grow and increasing stock density to utilize the  forage when it's at its peak.  
**[1:33:31-1:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:33:31):**  So man, I've been going for an hour and a half.  We've talked about all the stuff you screwed up and that's one of the questions I get.  You like to ask right now, what's the worst thing you screwed up and what did it teach  
**[1:33:44-1:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:33:44):**  you?  Well, I don't know.  I've made a lot of mistakes.  
**[1:33:51-1:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:33:51):**  Some of them were devastating, but I've always been in the belief.  It's something I've always pounded into my kids is never be afraid to fail because I  think mistakes are learning opportunities.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:34:02):**  So if you can learn from them, then that kind of lessens the blow.  Boy, some of my biggest mistakes, probably not asking why soon enough, putting way too  much faith and confidence in a team that I had that I thought had my best interest in  
**[1:34:25-1:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:34:25):**  the 80s.  Those are a couple of big mistakes that really come back to haunt me, obviously big time.  Then the other biggest mistake would have been after 2013-14 when I'm going through  
**[1:34:45-1:35:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:34:45):**  the meltdown financially, the whole farm was not walking away soon enough.  I should have declared bankruptcy, gathered up, cut my losses, got out and started over.  But because I didn't, I suffered financially, my family suffered financially, I became depressed,  
**[1:35:10-1:35:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:35:10):**  I buried all that.  I fought a losing battle for another five years that took 10 or 20 years off of my life.  I had no business fighting.  
**[1:35:21-1:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:35:21):**  I should have walked away sooner.  Our best attribute is supposed to be our pride, but it's also our worst.  We've got to learn to keep that in check a little better.  
**[1:35:38-1:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:35:38):**  Tim Cynova I think we all get hung up on what we feel  like the neighbors think of us or what we think the community thinks of us.  Especially at the end of the day, I don't think anybody cares.

There isn't anybody sitting around the bar talking crap about my cows or my finances.  That's all up here.  
**[1:36:10-1:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:36:10):**  That's all in our heads and we do it to ourselves.  I do it to myself.  Did you find any resources to help you through any of that?  
**[1:36:23-1:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:36:23):**  Tim Cynova Resources to help me through the mental part?  Tim Cynova Yes.  I'm sorry.  
**[1:36:28-1:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:36:28):**  Yeah.  Mental part.  Tim Cynova No, I hid my depression.  
**[1:36:33-1:36:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:36:33):**  I denied it.  Well, first of all, I didn't realize it.  It's not like you wake up one morning and look in the mirror and there's depression  
**[1:36:42-1:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:36:42):**  or something like that written across your forehead and you just say, oh, well, I caught  a cold yesterday and I caught depression today and I better take a pill for that.  I don't even know when I realized that my mental health was at risk, but it took several  
**[1:37:00-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:37:00):**  years and then it took a couple of years after that of me admitting it to myself and then  more time after that to admit it to somebody else because the perception of mental illness,  is there something wrong with that person?  
**[1:37:22-1:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:37:22):**  They need to be locked up in a home and nobody's certainly going to drown or do business with  somebody that's depressed because that's not right.  God forbid anybody in town see your pickup parked at the therapist's office.  
**[1:37:38-1:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:37:38):**  Exactly.  Absolutely.  I did go through some therapy when I got divorced, but I parked in the back because I didn't  
**[1:37:48-1:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:37:48):**  want anybody to see my pickup parked there.  It did a lot of good to help me deal with, I mean, everybody goes through depression  in their life.  
**[1:37:57-1:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:37:57):**  There's multiple ways of being depressed and things like going through a divorce or when  my brother died, there's a depression that come and go, hopefully.  They're usually shorter lived if you deal with them properly.  
**[1:38:12-1:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:38:12):**  If not, they can grow into something even worse.  But yeah, it's just something you don't want to admit in public.  My God, there's something wrong with you, but we don't realize that it's a disease just  
**[1:38:25-1:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:38:25):**  like cancer or diabetes.  Especially in farming, when suicide rates are going through the roof, we better find  a way to address this because we're the greatest people on the planet.  
**[1:38:37-1:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:38:37):**  I think we need to keep some of us around.  So we better find a way.  But once I did, stupidly, not stupidly, Lynette and I, by this time, we're changing our diets  
**[1:38:50-1:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:38:50):**  and from what we were reading and hearing is, I'd quit using the chemicals.  We knew the chemicals had, they played into my depression and my mental health weaknesses.  And we thought that just by getting away from the chemicals and eating a cleaner diet and  
**[1:39:08-1:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:39:08):**  more nutrition and getting the probiotics and prebiotics into me, that we could probably  cure it like that.  And then we thought about, well, when we get rid of the farm and the stress and we move  
**[1:39:19-1:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:39:19):**  to this new farm and some of that debt is removed, that'll cure it.  We were wrong.  I still got the chemicals in me.  
**[1:39:29-1:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:39:29):**  I'm not detoxed.  We got new stresses on the farm.  And this will be really tough, Brian, because we're all these, and you're not old, but all  
**[1:39:40-1:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:39:40):**  these old white guys that are farmers today and changing our diets is bad enough.  Taking sugar out of our diet is difficult enough.  Cutting back on alcohol or eliminating it is difficult enough.  
**[1:39:54-1:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:39:54):**  But telling a farmer to start meditating, to go sit out on the hill, barefooted in the  pasture and turn off the cell phone and become at one with nature for a few minutes a day,  ain't what a farmer wants to hear.  
**[1:40:08-1:40:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:40:08):**  You had me and you'll turn off the cell phone.  That's my hardest thing is unplugging and putting away the stupid screens.  But until we start doing that, and until we start letting our emotions out and understanding  
**[1:40:25-1:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:40:25):**  it's OK to cry and it's OK to go sit barefooted in the pasture and not do anything for five  minutes except listen to the crickets and the cows and not think about any of that stuff.  That's a whole new level of unlearning that I don't know how to do yet, but I'm trying.  
**[1:40:43-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:40:43):**  It's OK to see a therapist and you can park in the front.  It's OK to see a therapist and you can park in the front.  I think the big thing is that I don't have anything against getting on some prescriptions  
**[1:40:55-1:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:40:55):**  maybe but that's not the answer.  We've got to find a way to fix ourselves through getting at one with nature, getting some therapy,  learning how to deal with our emotions and opening up to our inner circle.  
**[1:41:11-1:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:41:11):**  And it's difficult.  It's difficult because some of us lead lives of semi-isolation because of distance from  town, distance from neighbors.  
**[1:41:23-1:41:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:41:23):**  Sometimes I feel like I'd rather live in an area where neighbors were a little bit closer.  But then again, there's a lot of times unfortunate that I can go out to the ranch and there isn't  another soul that I can see here even with a pair of binoculars.  
**[1:41:42-1:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:41:42):**  That's really nice.  Whether you're going to talk to a therapist or your significant other or a friend, I think  that that's one thing that can help everybody is just if you're having trouble, if you're  
**[1:41:58-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:41:58):**  feeling down, go talk to somebody.  Nobody's going to make fun of you.  Quit being self-conscious about what everybody in town thinks of you because no one really  
**[1:42:09-1:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:42:09):**  cares.  To be honest, let's take a really close look at our urban cousins.  Think they don't have some issues of their own that they're covering up as well?  
**[1:42:23-1:42:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:42:23):**  Oh gosh, I don't know.  I wouldn't know.  I don't live in town, but sure.  
**[1:42:29-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:42:29):**  They have to.  Just the stress of driving through town, like to go to a doctor's appointment.  And when I say town, I'm not talking about Medicine Lodge like Wichita.  
**[1:42:38-1:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:42:38):**  Like going to Medicine Lodge is not stressful.  It's like not any more stressful sometimes than going to check the mailbox, but Wichita  traffic these days, we plan our trips just because it is stressful and doing it every  
**[1:42:55-1:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:42:55):**  day, you get used to that stress, but that doesn't mean it's not there.  Our lives are just stress has become such a part of our everyday life.  Farmers, worrying about when the next payment or how the next payment is going to be made.  
**[1:43:16-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:43:16):**  And let's face it, they work all night and miss their kids' games and dance recitals  and the neighborhood picnics.  But the people in town is the same way.  
**[1:43:26-1:43:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:43:26):**  You spend all day in traffic and you miss your kids' games and you work late so you  can afford that third car and fourth TV and a house that you don't need.  And we just build our lives around this consumeristic bullshit that leads to stress, which leads  
**[1:43:44-1:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:43:44):**  to inflammation, which just adds to the glyphosate and all the stuff wrong in our gut.  And here we are pretty soon we're living in a world wearing masks and having to lock down  on purpose because we're not smart enough to do it on our own to quit the rat race every  
**[1:44:00-1:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:44:00):**  once in a while and just spend some time at home with the family.  Because we're afraid of a new strain of bad cold.  So we've got to find a way to get the stress out of our life.  
**[1:44:14-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:44:14):**  And to me, that's what this whole conversation has been about for an hour and a half or however  long we've been into it now is we've got to downsize farms.  We've got to find a way to make them more profitable, less stressful, more farmers on  
**[1:44:27-1:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:44:27):**  the land, more schools in the rural communities, smaller cities, happier farmers.  It's got to be the end goal or we're not going to be here to do another podcast in a few  years.  
**[1:44:42-1:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:44:42):**  That's almost a scary thought.  I hope we are here in a few years to come back and do one.  I do too.  
**[1:44:52-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:44:52):**  At the rate we're going today, it probably won't happen.  We can't end on that.  We've got to end on a high note.  
**[1:45:01-1:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:01):**  When is your next field school?  I wish I could announce we're not going to know until about the first or second week  of February.  
**[1:45:11-1:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:11):**  We're waiting on it.  We've got a call with a speaker here on the third.  Because of COVID, it's probably going to be in September again because we get the option  
**[1:45:19-1:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:19):**  of being outside in September in Kansas, the weather is usually pretty nice.  Probably going to be in September one more year.  I will say that we are going to, since we're starting a new decade, it's probably going  
**[1:45:35-1:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:35):**  to take a completely new look.  For those that have been here before, it's going to be completely different than what  they've been through.  
**[1:45:42-1:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:42):**  We're seeing some things in education.  I've got some things up my sleeve, but I think it's time we revamp education in rural America.  Field school 11 is going to take on a new look.  
**[1:45:56-1:46:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:45:56):**  I think it's going to be, our big goal is instead of just educating farmers and attendees,  we want to empower them.  Awesome.  
**[1:46:08-1:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:46:08):**  Where would a person go, where would a person be able to watch or sign up for updates to  find out when the field school was?  You can go to our website, fullerfieldschool.com.  
**[1:46:24-1:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:46:24):**  You can follow me on Facebook at Circle 7 by Fuller Farms or Instagram or LinkedIn at  Gail Fuller.  I also have a personal page on Facebook.

You can sign up and get on our mailing list.  I can tell you we are already half full for 2022 and we haven't even announced dates or  
**[1:46:47-1:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:46:47):**  speakers yet.  Will you save me a spot?  I will save you a spot, my friend.  
**[1:46:53-1:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:46:53):**  I'll save you two spots because this is about team, not about one person.  I see what you did there.  I see what you did there.  
**[1:47:01-1:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:01):**  You're kind of making me feel bad because you've done 10 of these and I haven't made  it over to a single one yet.  Yeah, your dad's been to a couple.  
**[1:47:15-1:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:15):**  We haven't seen your smiling face there yet.  Looking forward to that.  I'll have to bring a mobile recorder.  
**[1:47:20-1:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:20):**  Maybe we can make some good content while I'm there.  I think you mentioned our mutual friend, Matt Kleffer.  There's a chance that he and his family will be here entertaining us during timeouts.  
**[1:47:36-1:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:36):**  Even if he's not entertaining, I'm sure he'll be there.  That'll be a good legendary time.  He is entertaining with or without the guitar.  
**[1:47:44-1:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:44):**  Let's put it that way.  I've done a couple podcasts with him.  He is a very, very interesting guy to talk to.  
**[1:47:53-1:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:47:53):**  I really enjoy every second that I get to talk to Matt Kleffer.  Yeah, it's never boring with him, no doubt.  Okay.  
**[1:48:04-1:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:48:04):**  Well, we know how to find you and where the field school is.  Have we forgot that I forget to ask you anything that you need to talk about today?  I don't think so.  
**[1:48:13-1:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:48:13):**  I mean, we covered a broad range.  We didn't really cover re-growing rural communities and regenerative ag, but there's always a  part two.  
**[1:48:21-1:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:48:21):**  Yes, sir, there is.  Well, Gail, I don't want to take up any more of your day.  I really appreciate the time you've given me and I appreciate it.  
**[1:48:33-1:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:48:33):**  Thank you.  It's been an honor.  It's been a lot of fun.  
**[1:48:36-1:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/49-Gail-Fuller-No-Till-is-literally-a-tool-e1di5cb#t=1:48:36):**  It has been a lot of fun.  And you have to enjoy the rest of your day.  And gang, enjoy the rest of your week and we'll be back next Monday.

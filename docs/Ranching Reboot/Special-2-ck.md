A lot of you have had questions about just who CK is and what's her story and why she's  on the show and what does she have to do with regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:06):**  And you know, over the last two months, a lot of those questions have come up.  And we thought that this would be a fantastic way to get those questions answered.  So some of y'all could get to know CK.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:18):**  I may not be the best person to interview her.  So I turned that task over to my lovely lady, Tanya.  So without getting into too many more words, this is a really great episode.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:30):**  It's heartfelt.  And it's a very inspiring story.  And I hope you'll stick around to the end and give it a listen.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:37):**  See on the other side.  All right, everyone.  Welcome to another episode of Ranching Reboot.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:43):**  Today we have a special host who's going to be interviewing me.  Her name is Tanya.  Tanya, how are you doing?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:50):**  I'm good CK.  Thanks for having me.  We have been listening to the show for a few weeks now and everybody seems to kind of wonder  
**[0:01:59-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:01:59):**  who CK is exactly.  And we've talked a little bit about how to get that out.  And Brian and I had a conversation the other night, thought it would be really interesting  
**[0:02:10-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:02:10):**  for me to come on and interview and ask questions because I'm a question and asker.  And I, I would love to know a little bit more about you and to help our listeners understand  who you are.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:02:21):**  Right.  So, um, I don't know, let's go ahead and yeah, just start what I'm doing now.  Yeah, let's um, so, so I, I just kind of want to set this up almost like an agenda of like  
**[0:02:37-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:02:37):**  how this how this conversation is going to go since we're kind of reversing the tables  and you're interviewing me who I'm usually interviewing the guest with Brian.  So I want to talk about like what I'm doing now and where I'm at in the world.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:02:51):**  I also really want to talk about something that, um, that I don't really share in my  professional setting and I really don't share it in my circle unless you're really, really  close with me, like my husband and, um, a few other people who I've broken down that  
**[0:03:05-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:03:05):**  I could trust this with you, um, is my, my childhood, which is not, it's a very unique  situation that I grew up with.  Um, but I do want to preface it with preface it with this is, um, I am not a victim of  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:03:21):**  my circumstances.  I am who I chose to become because of my circumstances.  So I really don't want any pity from anyone.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:03:28):**  I, uh, I just want to share who I am as a thinker and why I think I've evolved into  this world of ranching and the profession that I am.  Um, so that my listeners who are trying to trust me with interviewing them and them sharing  
**[0:03:44-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:03:44):**  their vulnerable stories can understand the vulnerable things that are in my life as well.  So tell us a little bit about where you are right now then.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:03:55):**  Start there.  Yeah.  Where and, and outside of ranching reboot, what does CK do every day?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:01):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um, in the past five years, I've lived in four different States in two different  
**[0:04:09-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:09):**  countries.  So, so right now I'm living in Manhattan, Kansas.  Um, I'm, I'm a native from California who married a native Idaho in who wanted to go  
**[0:04:19-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:19):**  to vet school.  And so I, um, right now I'm supporting my husband a hundred percent financially so that  he can live his dream, which I believe he has a true calling for being a food animal  
**[0:04:29-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:29):**  veterinarian.  Uh, so we decided to, we were living in California when we first got married and then we got  into vet school in the Caribbean and St. Kitts.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:41):**  Um, and then we deferred for about a year before we went because I wanted to try living  in Idaho, uh, before we went to the Island so that we can decide once vet school's done,  where are we going to settle down?  
**[0:04:54-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:04:54):**  And so, uh, so I lived in Idaho for a while and that's where we're going to decide to  settle down because California just doesn't pencil out when you're trying to be a business  owner or a, at all in any way.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:07):**  Yeah.  Um, it's a beautiful place to live with as regards to the environment and the climate  and this access to different types of landscapes.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:17):**  Um, but it's not a really fun place to raise a family and then try to be a prosperous businessman  or woman.  Uh, yeah.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:25):**  So Idaho is where your husband's from.  Is that right?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:29):**  So he's from, he's from Southern Idaho.  He has a, he's so he's one of nine siblings.  So he has eight siblings, four sisters and four brothers and was homeschooled and they're  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:42):**  all very, very successful people.  I admire them so much.  They're like homesteaders as well.  
**[0:05:48-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:05:48):**  So I've actually learned a lot about self-sufficiency, self-sufficiency through them and just, they  really are able to, to work off of the land and provide for themselves.  So it's, it's been really fun to be part of their family.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:00):**  Very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:03):**  So my job now with, with Pasture Map, uh, I've been doing for the past almost four years,  over four years now.  And uh, my role has changed quite a bit from when I first started.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:14):**  I first started as kind of a contractor to help get ranchers to buy those subscriptions.  Now my title is head of growth and I really, I really liked that title that I have because  my job is really to contribute to the growth of my ranchers businesses.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:30):**  Like we have to figure out what's working well and what can we improve on?  And I really do see that as, is, um, it's a vulnerable thing to show up to, to someone's  company, even if we're just a software system that helps with their management for the grazing  
**[0:06:47-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:47):**  and the herd records and other things, um, to just admit that anything's wrong.  Right.  It's really hard to say that.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:06:57):**  And so you have this tattoo on your foot, Tanya, can you share what it says?  I have two.  Do you have two?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:06):**  Okay.  Yes.  So one says, choose to find the beauty in everything.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:12):**  Yeah.  And the other one says, no problems, only solutions.  Yes.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:17):**  And so that is 100% what I do is I tell these ranchers, we have no problems.  We only want to find new solutions.  And so when I saw that tattoo on your foot, when I first met you, I was like, I love this  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:28):**  girl already.  Like, we're going to be, we're going to be fine.  Um, so, so it's, it's been, it's been an interesting five years.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:35):**  I'm really excited to actually settle down and, and, and plant roots, um, and, and not  live in so many different States.  So other States that we lived in was Texas.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:48):**  And then when we lived in the Caribbean, uh, it just was not fun.  People think, oh, that's really, that's really awesome.  CK, you got to live on this Caribbean Island that really is picturesque.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:07:59):**  It is where, where people go to travel to destination vacations.  Um, but culturally and economically, it just was, it was actually like a third world country.  Uh, so they didn't really have reliable water or were like any kind of energy infrastructure.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:08:15):**  So like we, we were always worried about our power and our water going off.  So we'd have to make sure we sometimes shower before we weren't going to have water.  We'd have to have like fresh water of jugs, um, at the ready, even, even not even in hurricane  
**[0:08:29-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:08:29):**  season, that was just like a thing you had to have fresh water and also puddle water  so that you can use the plumbing.  And um, and then also you just being, I guess I want to say I'm a country girl.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:08:41):**  I love the wide open spaces and I felt trapped.  I felt like I really did get the Island fever and also my career with Pastor Mapa had so  much potential for growth and I felt kind of stuck behind that potential because I was  
**[0:08:54-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:08:54):**  landlocked and I wasn't able to travel to where some of these big branches were that  I really wanted to help improve with.  Uh, so, so that's like what I've been doing this last five years.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:06):**  Um,  It's with about, with talking about being landlocked.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:12):**  And, and not being able to help with Pasture Mapa.  So where, when you came back to the States after you guys moved back, you moved to Texas  and  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:20):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that was when the company sold that we sold based out of California originally and  
**[0:09:25-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:25):**  the company had been acquired by a Texas, um, buyer.  And so Soil Works, natural capital, um, owns Pasture Mapa now.  And I moved to Texas to keep my job basically because I was nervous that they were going  
**[0:09:40-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:40):**  to give me the acts, uh, which that was never really a concern.  That was, that was me projecting off of my own insecurities.  They were like, CK, we were never planning on getting rid of you.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:50):**  Like we could not like, and I did get that feedback from my ranchers too.  They're like, Pasture Mapa would not work without you CK.  Like you, you maintain the relationships and, and you fight for us.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:09:59):**  And so, um, I heard that.  Yeah.  My question with that was going was when you moved back to the States and you moved to  
**[0:10:08-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:10:08):**  Texas, did you, from there, did you start traveling around a lot to different ranches  at that point or did you do most of your work from Texas?  So that's when I started going, well, cause so Texas is huge.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:10:21):**  Like it, it took, it can take like eight hours or five hours going one way in any direction.  And so that is when I started finally just going and doing ranching visits and not asking  if, if, uh, if that like for, not for permission, but, but I was like, Hey, like Birdwell and  
**[0:10:37-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:10:37):**  Clark, uh, they're having, they, they have some questions getting their new Cowboys on  boarded and they want me to train them, I'm going to go spend a day with them in like  train these, these Cowboys to, to use their phone for the app.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:10:53):**  And I think once I started doing that and then I went up and visited with, with you  and Brian one weekend, um, you know, those have been my best connections with, with how  Pash Map should work and is working on ranches and, uh, and actually be there and build that  
**[0:11:09-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:11:09):**  relationship with people.  Because you know, I meet, I meet thousands of ranchers every year and, and like, you  know, I will give you the energy that you give me and I'm, I'm not going to ask for  
**[0:11:21-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:11:21):**  more than what you're, you're willing to share, but I also just don't, um, it's once you meet  someone in person and you actually see, uh, that you can have like almost like an off  side conversation about, you know, this is really my start with ranching and this is,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:11:39):**  this is what, what has scared me and this is what keeps me up at night.  When you really break those, those walls down that you really realize that like, there's  a lot of impact that happens with the ranching community.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:11:51):**  That's not just, uh, mechanical.  Right.  Well, I, you know, I think I remember some things when, when Brian first started using  
**[0:12:00-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:00):**  pasture maps and, and trying to figure out ways to make it work better for the ranch.  I know a lot of the, the problems he had, you guys addressed personally.  Yeah, we did.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:11):**  And without, without that function, you know, it would have worked for him.  And without that connection, you guys would have never got that feedback.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:20):**  Absolutely.  Like there's, there's ranchers who use past map that I've never given us feedback or wanted  to use us.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:28):**  I call them my self-sufficient ranchers, but that actually probably is not the case.  Maybe they just don't feel welcome enough or to say anything.  And I really would, I would encourage you to always, if there's something that's not  
**[0:12:38-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:38):**  working complaint, complain to me and I will figure it out to get working because I've  had people.  And I think last summer in particular, there's a lot of sinking issues with Ryan Brian's  
**[0:12:49-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:49):**  ranch, uh, with their herd, your herdsmen.  And she would just text me like, CK, I was in the bull pasture and the sink, it didn't  sink.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:12:59):**  Like all my subdivisions are gone.  So I'd have to call our engineers and be like, Hey, can you, can you fix this?  And we did.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:13:06):**  And, and I wouldn't have known if she had not said anything, she would have just struggled  with thinking that passion map wasn't going to work.  And there was no, there was no one to ask for help.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:13:15):**  Yeah.  And I think that's a service that people want to have, but don't always know, don't always  know how to use, or don't always know how to ask for, don't always feel comfortable,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:13:25):**  you know, maybe quote over extending.  We're not wanting to bug you, but something that I learned at a pretty young age was that  this squeaky wheel gets the grease and people say that offsite, but it's true.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:13:37):**  You know, sometimes you have to speak up when it's uncomfortable and, and then you get that.  And so it's really, that's really, I think an awesome way that you are, are trying to  connect so close with your customers.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:13:48):**  Yeah.  And I think that is what has made passion map so successful is, is maintaining, really  realizing that relationships are the number one thing to, to driving a business.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:04):**  Because you're going to get that retention.  You're going to get the loyalty because you're being loyal to your customer as well.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:09):**  So,  yeah.  So you want to talk a little bit about your childhood from there?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah.  Yes.  A little bit about where you came from.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:20):**  Yeah.  So I, I kind of mapped it out in, so I have segments of my childhood, which people are  like, you're crazy.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:26):**  So you get you had segments, but no, I had segments.  So I had, you know, stages of my childhood that really impact who I am today.  And I wrote down this, this quote from Abraham Lincoln, just as a reminder, it says, you  
**[0:14:41-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:41):**  know, we can complain because rose bushes have thorns or rejoice because thorn bushes  have roses.  And I think that 100% is, is my outlook on life is I would not appreciate the good I  
**[0:14:53-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:14:53):**  have in my life today without the bad.  And I think it really taught me resiliency E and looking at things in, in, in, to be  honest, going back to that, there are no problems, only solutions.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:15:06):**  Like what is the answer?  Like if, and I, you know, whenever I'm doing decision-making with my ranches about like,  how do they want to approach changing things or transitioning from conventional to regenerative,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:15:17):**  I say, let's, let's do one thing at a time.  Let's understand getting this part down and then let's add a layer to it.  And like, let's just, let's problem, let's solve the easiest problem you have where we  
**[0:15:31-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:15:31):**  can, we can easily agree on the solution.  So so with that said, I, so I was born in Bakersfield, California.  And so if anyone knows the area, Bakersfield has a huge opioid epidemic.  
**[0:15:50-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:15:50):**  And especially back in, in the nineties, I think was even worse than it is today.  So a lot of low income people and poverty and, and just drugs, you know, in my mind,  like I just, I know a lot of people in Bakersfield that who are still, their lives are ruined  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:16:08):**  because of drugs.  And I'm like, how do we break the cycle?  And I think I, I'm the person I'm the one, I'm the one who broke that cycle.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:16:15):**  So so I was, I was born accidentally.  So I was not, I was not one of those births that were planned.  My mom accidentally got pregnant with me with, with her drug dealer.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah.  So I was like very much not a plan.  So I know that that's going to be shocking to people who hear this and I just want to  
**[0:16:41-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:16:41):**  say that was just my life.  So so I, so I, I ended up, you know, being raised by my birth mom.  My birth father never really recognized me as his child, which, you know, like this happens,  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:16:53):**  right?  This just is, this is the real life.  Like this happens to a lot of people and my mom was a single mother on drugs.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:17:00):**  And so we, I grew up homeless for the first seven years of my life in and out of homes.  I remember at one point we lived, we lived in my mom's car and we were bathing in, in  like one of an irrigation canal to take, to take baths.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:17:18):**  And I also, you know, I remember her stealing like produce, like, like cabbage and carrots  from like nearby fields so that we could eat.  And to be honest, like as a child, like it didn't bother me.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:17:29):**  Like it was just like, that was life.  Like it, you know, I wasn't like, Oh, woe is me.  Like my mom, you know, is, has all these issues and she can't even take care of her child.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:17:38):**  Like she, she really did try to, but it was always drugs controlled her decision-making.  And so she just was, she was not a suitable mother.  She had, she had a lot, I have a lot of other siblings with, with my mom and she, she really  
**[0:17:52-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:17:52):**  didn't raise any of us and we've all kind of turned out okay.  Just to be honest.  So so with that, eventually the state got involved and removed, removed my, my mom from  
**[0:18:11-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:18:11):**  my care.  And I ended up living with family members, my grandparents at one point in time.  And then for a really long period of time, I lived with my aunt and uncle.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:18:23):**  And I really thought that that, that was going to be my saving grace and life was going to  live with my aunt and uncle who seemed to have it all together and were very religious  people.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:18:38):**  And they also took in my younger sister too.  So I was really excited to be with her and it really just it was a really bad eight years  of my life from seven to 15.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:18:51):**  It was, so something I have shared on social media is that I was a child of violence.  And so am I scaring you, Tanya?  No.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:00):**  Okay, good.  No, you're not scaring me.  I'm just listening.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:03):**  I'm just listening.  Yeah.  So, so I went to live with my aunt and uncle and I stayed, I was there for eight years  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:10):**  until I was 15.  And so I was actually a really, a really serious child.  I don't really know why.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:18):**  I think it was just because of my circumstances.  Like I just, I had to survive.  Right.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:24):**  You said you had a lot of other siblings.  Yeah.  And you were with your sisters.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:29):**  So before you moved to be with your aunt, did you spend a lot of time with your siblings  and were you older or younger?  Did you have younger or older siblings?  
**[0:19:38-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah.  So I had, I had two older brothers and then I was the third child of my mother's.  And then I had a younger brother and a younger sister.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:19:49):**  And then I had a younger, another younger brother who I've never met.  I know it sounds so bad.  Like this, like this is me laughing because I know it sounds bad and that's why I do not  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:01):**  share this story.  And then it might, you know.  Yeah.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:06):**  Sounds bad is, is, is a lot.  And I don't, I don't, I don't want to talk over you or talk over your story, but this  is your story and this is what has made you you.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:15):**  So, you know, better, better good as far as how it happened.  It is what it is.  And, and yeah.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah.  So, so yeah, I had those siblings.  I was really close with my older brothers, to be honest.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:27):**  And my younger sister, I think when my, cause my sister went to live with my aunt and uncle  before I did, I was pretty devastated from losing her.  And my, my older brothers were, were teenagers.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:38):**  So they were getting into that phase where like, they didn't care about their little  sister anymore.  So I was like, I really want to go be with my sister.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:44):**  Like I don't want her to be alone.  And that was like, I'm going to go live with my aunt and uncle and with my sister.  And then also my aunt and uncle had three of their own kids.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:20:55):**  So it was like, you know, I, I do think about, you know, there's more than one, there's more  than two, there's multiple sides to a story.  And I think what I'm going to share is like, now that I'm older, I realized that my aunt  
**[0:21:09-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:21:09):**  and uncle probably signed up for more than they asked for.  And it was really stressful and they probably had some resentment for my birth mom and my  birth father.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:21:18):**  And, and to be honestly having the, the, the responsibility of taking care of me, who was  to be honest, always missing my mom.  And and just a different, I was just a serious child.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:21:31):**  So it was probably hard to figure out how to love me too.  But so I live with my aunt and uncle, they had just converted to, to being Christians.  And so, so growing up with them, very devout Christians, we were prominent members of our  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:21:51):**  church community.  And, you know, we, we actually cleaned the church every week.  We did the bus route every week.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:21:57):**  We never, I, you know, the eight years I lived there, I remember us never missing a Sunday  or Wednesday service.  Like it was just, it wasn't something that we did.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:22:06):**  And I remember just getting really, like really into being a Christian and being a devout  person and like getting into my biblical studies and learning how to study the Bible and then  practicing what I preach or what is preached to me.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:22:26):**  And then but then, then we would go home and, and then it just, they turned off, they turned  off that, I don't know what it is.  They turned off that characteristic.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:22:40):**  Yes.  And we would get home and it was like, Carissa, like, make sure you get the house clean.  I like, they truly believed that women were designed to do women's work, like inside house  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:22:56):**  cleaning and cooking.  And that was their role.  Like I remember my aunt telling me that and men responsibilities were outside doing like  
**[0:23:05-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:05):**  the yard work and like, so basically putting genders to, to duties.  Right.  But I, I thought it was like, she would tell me that and then I would end up having to  
**[0:23:15-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:15):**  do both.  I would have to do all the cooking and not the cooking, but all the cleaning I'd help  with cooking, all the chores, all of everyone's laundry, which there was seven of us.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:27):**  I would have to do all the laundry, mow the lawn, weed eat.  I would know how to, to, to mix gas, to put in a weed eater.  I like, I knew how to like prime.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:37):**  I was eight years old.  Right.  I would know how to prime it and do the choke so that you can start a weed eater and I could  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:43):**  weed eat or we breathe like a string of weed eater.  And like I could chop wood.  I could stack it.  
**[0:23:49-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:23:49):**  Like I could stack it very nicely because if I didn't fold the laundry the right way,  like, you know how you see, do you, is there a particular way that you fold towels?  Like there's like the pretty salon way of folding towels.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:03):**  Right.  And it's like, it's basically beach towel kind of like, that does not, that does not  store well.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:10):**  And I, I remember not folding it the right way and my aunt being pissed and like making  me refold all the towels.  And so, so it really started with emotional violence, which, which I know some people  
**[0:24:23-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:23):**  were like, Oh, what is that?  And it's like, I was dehumanized as a child and my, I was not only seen as just like a  paycheck for them because they were drawing wages from, from the state to take care of  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:34):**  me.  So I think that was like, cause I kept asking, why are you even having me live with you guys?  Like you guys hate me.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:40):**  Like, like I am not like, I, I am not treated like the way that you treat their actual kids.  And I just, I, I just remember that.  And then I remember we, we show up as these Christians and, and when we come home, we're  
**[0:24:56-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:24:56):**  not Christians.  And, and I remember finally, I think just getting, getting brave enough to, to challenge  that, that thought.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:25:09):**  And I remember it was, it was like, cause I had to do chores before I got on the school  bus every morning, which was like 7am.  And and I remember just being frustrated because all of the other kids got to like, just, just  
**[0:25:22-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:25:22):**  sleep in and hang out and do whatever they wanted.  And then I've like had missed taking the trash out cause I had just run out of time.  And I, and then I remember coming home and she was just waiting to like, scream at me.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:25:35):**  And I remember like, I don't understand like why I have to do everything.  And then you say, women's work is for inside stuff and men's work is for outside, but your  son, like you don't have him do anything.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:25:46):**  Like I have to do all of his work.  And I think that was the first time that she hit me.  And and, and then I realized, cause I had been submissive for a really long time to  
**[0:25:58-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:25:58):**  her.  Like, I remember if I would just, if I would just shut up and sit down and just do everything  that she'll want me to do, then then maybe she'll like me.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:07):**  Maybe maybe she'll accept me.  And it just, it was never that she just always saw me as, I think resentful for, for having  me in her care.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:18):**  And then she always, I don't know.  I think she always was, she was always thinking that I was going to end up like my, my birth  mom.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:28):**  And so it would frustrate me because she would tell me that all the time.  It's like, you're just like your mom, you're just like your mom.  And, and it just like, it devastated me.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:34):**  Cause I was like, I don't want to be anything like my mom.  Like my mom is not have her life together.  Like she's still like out there doing those bad things.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:44):**  And, and it just would be like, what, why do I, what do I do to make you think that?  And it was always just because I couldn't follow the laundry ride or I didn't do the  chores fast enough.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:26:54):**  And I remember we finally started trying to do counseling together.  And I told the counselor, like, I don't really want to do this if she's not going to commit  to doing this with me.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:27:07):**  And we finally sat down and he said, I want you guys both to say some one positive thing  about each other.  And then, so she had to say, she was, she was really able to say a positive thing about  
**[0:27:20-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:27:20):**  all of her kids first.  And then when she came on to me, the positive thing she had to say about me was like, she's,  it wasn't like it was, Karissa does the dishes really well.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:27:33):**  Like yeah.  How old were you at this point?  I was, it was, it was, I was 14, 13 or 14.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:27:42):**  And so it was at that point that I realized, so animals have, you know, it's either fight  or flight.  Right.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:27:50):**  And so it was, I did run away a couple of times and she knew, like, I was like, I just,  I miss my brothers and my mom.  And like, she had removed me completely from my actual birth family.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:03):**  And I was only allowed to interact with, with her and her three kids and her husband in  the church.  And so I just like felt like she cut off this piece of me and I wasn't allowed access to  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:15):**  it.  And so I think that's what her and I were like fighting for internally.  And maybe I wish I could, I wish, you know, when you look back at things, I wish I could  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:22):**  have communicated that better to her, but like I was a kid, like kids don't know how  to communicate.  Like they're trying to figure their lives out.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:30):**  And I remember, I just, I remember at that point, um, because I had, I had said like,  Hey, like, I want you to like either just put me in foster care, send me to back to  like my grandparents or I want to be emancipated.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:50):**  And I just like, I just, I like, we can all work well together.  Like we just can't do this.  So like, we just need to, to leave each other.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:28:57):**  And I remember like, she was just like, I'm not going to give you that.  Like I'm not going to give you that happiness.  And um, and so I said, you know what, like fight or flight, if I can't fly, then I'm  
**[0:29:10-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:10):**  going to fight.  And I remember I started with, uh, doing it in like, like I call it civil disobedience.  So I did it in ways that, that wasn't going to be physically violent.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:20):**  And so, so my thing was I stopped going to counseling.  Like I refused.  I was like, if you're not going to do it, I'm not going to do it.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:26):**  And if you're not going to show up the way that I'm showing up, I'm definitely not going  to do it.  And so, uh, so that was the first thing.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:36):**  And then we had, she had scheduled me a counseling appointment.  She had told me that morning, Hey, I don't want you to catch the best home because we're  going to come pick you up to take you to counseling, to, to fix me.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:50):**  Like I only, I was fixing myself.  Right.  And I remember just like, you know what, I'm just going to get on the bus and go home.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:29:57):**  Like I'm not going to counseling.  I have told her that I'm not doing it unless she does it with me.  And I think that was when the physical violence got really bad.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:06):**  Um, because my uncle had come home and he was very much scared of my aunt.  Um, cause he had tried to stick up for me a couple of times and she had just beat him  down.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:18):**  Like with her words, like you're you're, she's Buffalo-ing you, she has you manipulated.  I remember is what she said.  And uh, so he got shut up real quick and he would say that he's not going to fight this.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:31):**  And I remember my uncle coming home from that and he's like, you have to go, Karissa, come  on, you got to go to counseling.  Like this is the only way your aunt's going to be happy.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:38):**  And I was like, I'm not doing it.  Like I'm not doing it.  Like what is the point of this?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:43):**  And he dragged me.  He tried to drag me down the hallway out of the room.  I remember grabbing the, like the baseboards and the walls to like, you know, brace myself  
**[0:30:56-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:30:56):**  and hold like, so he couldn't force me out of the house because he was like trying to  fire him and carry me to counseling.  And I was like, no, like you can't force me to do this and I'm not going to.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:05):**  Um, and I remember, I mean, I ended up kicking him in between the lakes and I, cause I remember  that was the only way I can get them off of me from dragging me out of the house.  And I remember that's when he was like, okay, I'm done.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:17):**  And then my aunt came home and beat the crap out of me, like beat the crap out of me with  a belt.  She was so mad.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:24):**  And at that point, uh, I wasn't willing to get the police involved or anything.  Um, I really didn't want to open that can of worms.  Um, I really wanted to protect her still.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:38):**  Do you feel like you had any support outside of them at all?  You know, you mentioned the church and yeah, that's a good question.  Were you in school?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:48):**  So I was, I was in school.  Um, and I was in public school and I was, you know, that was my safe Haven and I was  in church.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:31:57):**  I did share it with the church because the church was actually the one doing the counseling  and I did share it with them.  And I think to this day, I still have a problem with organized religion.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:32:08):**  Um, because I think because my aunt and uncle were just so heavily supportive of the church,  like not only like as like, um, members, but like they actually like the services they  provided though.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:32:23):**  They did the school bus route.  They, they also cleaned the church every week.  And um, my, my uncle was a deacon as well.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:32:30):**  So he was like high, highly revered in the church.  And so the church just never believed me.  And and so it was just always like this kid is, this kid is messed up and it's because  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:32:44):**  yes.  And it's because of her background that I can't trust her word over this Bible thumping  lady.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:32:53):**  Um, and so, and so my, so then when I realized that the church had betrayed me and I realized  it's not, it's not Jesus who betrayed me.  It's the management of the church.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:33:06):**  Like it's a hundred percent a management was a management issue.  And I think they finally discovered because they ended up getting burned down the road  by this family, um, with some stuff, some scandal.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:33:17):**  But um, but then I realized, okay, I have to put on the suit of armor with a church.  The church is not going to help me.  So I thought if the church isn't there to help me and they actually see what's happening,  
**[0:33:30-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:33:30):**  um, cause like you could see how she treated me compared to her kids.  Um, and I thought there's no way the school system is going to help me like, no, like  I'm just not going to, I'm not going to get them involved because it's just going to end  
**[0:33:44-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:33:44):**  up hurting me more.  And then I won't have a safe Haven.  And it was, it was finally, um, so yeah, so, so I started fighting.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:33:55):**  I just, I decided I wasn't going to go to church anymore.  And I told her, my reasoning was, um, we're living a lie.  We are not real Christians.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:05):**  And if you expect me to show up and be fake at church, just so that you can look good,  I'm not going to do it.  And so I remember, I think that was a real, the real, the real winner that, that made  
**[0:34:17-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:17):**  her honestly hate me.  Um, and so the, so then we had one more, you know, cause I was challenging her authority  now.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:27):**  I'm going to question everything she does because she won't let me out.  Then I'm going to make her life a living hell.  Um, and, and yes, I realized that that's not the answer, but that is what I thought I had  
**[0:34:38-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:38):**  to do.  I think that was exceptionally brave for a young woman of that age to not have support  and to be able to stand up to somebody who would have been scary to you.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:50):**  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Just be able to have the courage to do that.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:34:54):**  I mean, I think, yeah, I don't know right or wrong.  I don't know that there was a right answer in that situation, but what you did was brave.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:35:03):**  Yeah.  So, so, you know, we, we had these more, these challenging matches and, um, and then like  one day was, it was a really bad altercation.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:35:13):**  Um, so she, like, we had this leather strap belt that we would, I mean, I would get Spanx  and like, they were deserve Spanx for lying, but she would beat me with this belt.  Um, and it was one of those old barber chair, you know, that they sharpen those thick ass  
**[0:35:31-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:35:31):**  leather straps and had a metal part of the, at the end.  And it had holes in it for, for aerodynamics.  And I'm laughing because, you know, I survived it and, but I remember her beating the crap  
**[0:35:45-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:35:45):**  out of me up and down my back on my neck.  Um, I tried to run out of the house to like get away from her and she was chasing me around  the house and she would slam the doors, um, in front of me and bolt them lock so that  
**[0:35:58-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:35:58):**  I couldn't escape to get on the bus that morning.  And when she had bolted that lock, she grabbed me by the hair and pulled me onto this office  desk.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:08):**  And I mean, I don't know.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  Like she, she choked the shit out of me and I thought I was going to die.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:15):**  Like I really, like, I thought I was going to die.  And I remember her daughter finally, cause usually what the kids would do when stuff  like this happened, they just go run to the back bedroom and like try to stay out of it  
**[0:36:26-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:26):**  because they just knew better.  You didn't get between this happening because then what happened to them?  Um, and then I remember the daughter being like, mom, stop, like, stop.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:40):**  You're like, this is really bad.  Stop.  And so finally I think she like realized what she like, how bad it was.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:44):**  And she let go of me and I just, I remember hearing the bus cause they had those, those  air breaks.  And I remember stopping to wait for us and I remember like flagging it down, racing to  
**[0:36:55-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:36:55):**  get on the bus and the bus driver, I mean, he didn't say anything, which I thought now  I'm looking at him like he should have said something cause he's supposed to be a mandated  reporter.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:37:03):**  He should have freaking said something.  And I remember he just not get involved with it and I'm like crying on the bus.  And then my friends, um, my friends come on the next stops and they're like, what the  
**[0:37:13-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:37:13):**  hell happened to you?  And they see the welts and they see the scratches and they see that like I'm been roughed up  and it was, um, uh, my friend who saw what happened because I was, I still at this point  
**[0:37:27-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:37:27):**  was not willing to like call CPS, um, or the police.  Like I just, I had seen with my birth mom and had been removed from the family and I've  seen with my other men that my mom had had in a relationship, what the police can do  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:37:44):**  to families.  And so for me it was like, oh, I don't want to open that can of worms.  Like I really do not want to ruin her life.  
**[0:37:50-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:37:50):**  My goal is I just want to be, I want to be removed from this home.  Like I need to be out of this situation.  And so, uh, it was, it wasn't until my best friend Brianne, uh, she went to the school  
**[0:38:02-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:02):**  and, and, and told them, she was like, my best friend just got her butt kicked by her  aunt and we need to do something about this.  And I remember the counselor calling me in and interviewing me and I remember begging  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:15):**  her, I remember begging her, please, please don't say anything.  Please don't do anything.  Like, it'll be fine.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:21):**  Like I can handle this.  And I was in junior high.  Um, the policeman came in and he was devastated.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:28):**  I remember it making him cry.  And I remember like, that was my moment of like, wow, this is, this is really serious.  If I'm making a grown man in uniform cry, like it is bad.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:39):**  And so CPS came, filed charges.  Um, I don't know how familiar you are with the social system.  It's just, it doesn't work.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:47):**  Uh, they really don't have the best interest for a child.  So they ended up having to send me home, um, because it's her words, a word against mine.  So they ended up just sending me home with my uncle and my uncle had to tell him that  
**[0:38:59-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:38:59):**  my aunt, that CPS came and then she ended up beating me again.  Um, and then at that point I was like, well, this can of worms is open or this Pandora  box is open and you can't put Pandora back in the box.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:39:09):**  And so I, I finally just was like, the next morning was like, yeah, well she found out  that it happened and she, she beat me again.  And I think my aunt was like, how do like, this is crazy.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:39:21):**  Like in how, like she, she couldn't deal with it.  And I mean, I didn't want to deal with it either.  So she basically kept me in my room.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:39:33):**  If I wasn't just me going to school the next few months, I had to go straight to my room  and stay in it.  Like I lived in my room, like kind of almost like a prisoner.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:39:41):**  Um, and of course, like she would feed me and stuff, but I was, I was not worth even  doing chores anymore at this point.  So I was like, okay, things are happening.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:39:53):**  Um, and then my, my aunt made me go to church one Sunday.  Well, she tried to make me go every Sunday.  And I remember just still being like, this is, I'm just not going to show up.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:03):**  So I ended up going, but I remember just like not doing anything.  And then I remember her just getting so mad at me because actually I don't even remember  the reason, but I remember it was a potluck Sunday.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:13):**  So it was about something about a dish or something.  And I remember just like bawling, like I was just upset with, with my life.  And so I remembered like trying to just go sit in our vehicle and cry it out alone.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:24):**  Cause I didn't want to do it with any of the church members.  And my aunt had to go to the store to get potlucks.  And I remember her throwing me out of the car on the ground and saying, you know, get  
**[0:40:34-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:34):**  the freak out of here.  And then I ran away.  And so I ran away, called my birth mom to come pick me up.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:44):**  She, she did.  And so I was running, I was a runaway for two days.  And then when I came, my, my grandpa made me go back.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:40:53):**  He was like, you can't just run away and stay a runaway.  Like there's consequences for this Carissa.  And I was like, okay.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:00):**  So he drove me back.  And and then my aunt just like, watching and believe that I ran away to, to my mom.  She thought I ran away too.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:15):**  So this was her next line of attack.  She thought I ran away to be with a boy.  So she was trying to smear my name and I was like, okay, whatever.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:22):**  I'll let you believe that.  Cause it doesn't even affect me at this point, whatever the police ended up getting involved.  And in the guys were, the police were really nice.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:31):**  They're like, we, we get it, you've come from a hard life.  They're like, there's, there's a lot of not good things going on in your life, but we  can't remove you from the home because you're being fed and you have a place to sleep.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:45):**  Right.  Yeah.  And at this point I had been playing the violin for a few years and I remember the police  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:41:55):**  officer saying, Hey, I also play the violin.  And so we, like, for me, I felt like I connected with him on with something that wasn't like  traumatizing.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:03):**  And I was like, yeah, I really love it.  And he's like, you should, you should put your energy into the violin thing.  Like you should do that.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:10):**  And so I ended up, I did, I ended up doing that and I ended up like being, um, like first  chair, which, which you guys probably listening won't understand what that means, but that  means like you're number one, you're the best violinist out of like 50.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:24):**  And I remember just always striving to be first chair.  I was, I was always invited to do, um, like the honors, uh, kind of events for, for orchestras.  And then I actually ended up being part of Sequoia Youth Symphony and we ended up traveling.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:42):**  And this is after I, I finally got out of my aunt's situation, but I actually ended  up traveling in Europe, part of a symphony, which is like my top 10 best experience of  my life.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:53):**  Right.  Wow.  And I got advice from that police officer.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:42:57):**  I mean, it was huge.  It was like, Hey, like you need to focus all this negative energy into something that's  positive.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:05):**  And I, and I truly believe that I think to break the cycle, like you need to focus your  energy and not dwell on the negative.  And I finally, I finally figured it out through my music.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:18):**  Um, and, and that was for me, like very therapeutic.  Like it was like, finally there's hope in my life because at this point I was, I was  contemplating, I was contemplating some pretty horrible things to do to myself, um, to be  
**[0:43:32-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:32):**  honest, cause I didn't see a way out.  Like I didn't think, I didn't think that they were going to let me decide if I could be  happy.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:41):**  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, okay.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:46):**  So let me just wrap up this bad part of my life with my aunt, cause it's going to get  good guys.  I promise.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:43:52):**  So, so my aunt, um, she kind of got, she was getting mad that one, I was liking straight  A's.  Everyone loved me at school and then I was getting really good at this violin thing.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:44:06):**  And I don't mean to project, but it was like, I was, I was the problem kid in, in her, with  her five kids who was also doing the best.  So it's like, everyone kind of question is like, it doesn't add up.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:44:19):**  Like how can you say Carissa is this terrible person when she's getting straight A's, everyone  likes her at her school and she's doing these phenomenal things with her violin, you know?  And so I think people are finally, finally, the wool was getting taken off of their, their  
**[0:44:37-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:44:37):**  eyes.  Um, and I think she was finally like seeing, seeing that.  So she was really still out to prove that I was this terrible person.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:44:46):**  Um, and so we, she ended up, we ended up having like another altercation because she just,  she just didn't like me.  Um, and anything I said or did, she would pick apart and it was frustrating.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:44:57):**  Like I would, I would have to bottle up my emotions and then I would explode and then  we'd end up in these screaming matches and, um, and then it would end up and she would  be physical with me.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:08):**  And my thing is the police officers, when they had to come to visit me, when I ran away,  they told me, I just want to tell you now, if you ever end up hitting your aunt, you  will go to juvenile hall.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:19):**  And I remember my aunt being in the room when they said that.  And I really think that they planted that seed of thought for her.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:26):**  Like your face right now, you're like, Oh, I know what's going to happen now.  So, so my aunt, she ended up being the crap out of me again.  And then she knew I was going to go to school and tell on her, right?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:38):**  Because I thought if I keep, if we just keep reporting this, eventually they'll remove  me from the home.  Right.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:44):**  And so I finally, this point I was in high school and I finally did it.  And I actually had a competent counselor and her name is Mrs. Bealy.  And she finally stuck her neck out for me.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:45:57):**  And she took pictures of, of what happened around my neck.  And I remember my orchestra instructor, she said, what happened to your neck?  Did a cat, did a cat get, get to your neck?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:46:06):**  And I just remember like crying because at this point I was like, man, like, I just don't  want to have this conversation with you.  And then so she sent me to the office.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:46:14):**  Mrs. Bealy got involved, called a police officer and he documented what happened.  So what happens with this situation?  The police officer has to get my side of the story in my aunt's side of story.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:46:25):**  And so my aunt lied and said that I hit her.  I knew I, and I like, I know that she tells people I hit her and I think almost she believes  it because she's told this story, this lies for so many years.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:46:42):**  But I remember like her choking me that morning.  And I just remember, I can't hit her.  I can't hit her because that would be the scariest thing ever is go to juvenile hall  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:46:53):**  to go to jail.  Right.  And so I remember the police officer going and taking my aunt's side of the story.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:00):**  And then I just went on with my school day and went to my classes.  And then I remember getting one of my teachers getting called and they're like, Hey, Carissa,  like they need you to go to the office.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:10):**  Remember getting called in the office.  The police officer takes me and arrest me and takes me to juvenile hall.  And I ended up staying the night in juvenile hall for I think assault or something like  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:20):**  that.  Right.  Fucking wild.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:26):**  Sorry.  Brian's going to have to bleep that out.  But maybe, maybe he will.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:31):**  Maybe he will.  That's fine if he doesn't.  But I just don't want anyone like, sorry, but it is wild.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:38):**  It was a prudent spot for it.  It was a prudent spot.  I've got wild stories too.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:42):**  I'll tell you someday you won't feel alone.  Everyone has a history.  And like, it's, it's like very much a thing where we have such shame for history.  
**[0:47:52-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:47:52):**  We don't want to talk about it.  But I think it really develops on who we are as a person.  I think, I think one thing just to admit is I know I am I have a high emotional intelligence.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:03):**  Like I can sit in a room and if I know something's going wrong, I can, I I'm probably the first  person to see it.  And a lot of times I ended up mediating this.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:13):**  I'm like, Oh, either I stop it or I mediate it or I go and talk to that person in private  and be like, Hey, I know I could, I could tell that by the way he talked to you or she  talked to him that upset you.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:24):**  I don't think that was cool.  I just want you to know, I hear you.  I see you.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:29):**  I don't, I don't want you to think that that didn't go noticed.  Yeah, and that's not something that just everybody can do.  Some people are great at that and some people are terrible at it and it's, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:38):**  It's something that not only I think you come with, but you learn and situations you've  been in.  That's something you've honed certainly.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:45):**  Yeah.  So, so I, so I stayed the night in juvenile hall and that was, that was, that was an experience,  right?  
**[0:48:53-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:48:53):**  So you're so funny.  Cause you know, some people will ask like randomly like, like they'll ask questions  like never have I ever, and like, they'll just expect no one to have done this.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:01):**  And so sometimes people were like, never have I ever gotten arrested and gone to jail.  And I'm like, oh yeah, I've done that.  Like, I'm such a bad-ass, like I went to jail when I was a kid.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:11):**  And it's like, totally.  I mean, it's, it's, I'm like, oh, it's not really a good story.  And that's usually how I say it was like, it was like a misunderstanding, but I remember  
**[0:49:18-0:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:18):**  like, you know, the next step after you get jailed and you get charged with like assault  or whatever you get charged with, you get on probation.  So I'm like, okay, I'm on probation.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:27):**  Then you have to meet with a probation officer.  And I just remember being just like, so confused.  And I remember my first meeting with him, my aunt took me because she was so smug about  
**[0:49:36-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:36):**  it.  I remember she was just so proud that she finally caught me.  Like she finally put me in this chokehold and I could not resist like being deemed this  
**[0:49:45-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:45):**  terrible person.  And I remember having my meeting with a probation officer, it was just me and him.  And I remember sitting down and so he was just like, he was going probably overloaded,  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:49:57):**  just going through it.  Like, okay, this is what we're doing.  And I was like, I have a question.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:01):**  He goes, yeah.  And I was like, how am I able to get charged with something that, that didn't happen?  And I was like, I was like, I realized that I spent the night in juvenile hall for hitting  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:16):**  my aunt.  And I was like, but like, where's my due process?  I remember asking that.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:20):**  And I said, yeah, right.  Fucking smartest thing I ever did.  Like, because that is what got me my ticket out of jail.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:29):**  Cause he was like, oh, you want to contest this?  Like you're not agreeing as a mission of guilt that you did this.  I was like, no, like I've, I told the police officer this whole time that I never did it.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:39):**  And the, my, you know what my problem was is I said that I did not want to press charges  onto her.  And when he asked her, do you want to press charges on me?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:47):**  Because she had said that I hit her.  She was like, oh, hell yeah.  I want to teach her a lesson.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:50:54):**  Like he's like, she, I think she wanted to scare me straight.  Yeah.  So so I mean, I guess it would have worked if I had not asked that question.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:03):**  Right.  That's pretty amazing.  And you were, you were at 15.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:07):**  Yeah.  I was 15.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:10):**  That's freaking amazing that a 15 year old had the insight to do that.  You know, like I really, I do think it was divine provination.  Like I really do think that the Lord and I'm not, I really am not a religious person.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:22):**  Like I'm actually terrible Christian guys.  So sorry for that.  But I do think that he finally was like, this is my way to help you.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:28):**  Like this is my way to help you.  And, and then, so my aunt had to go back into the office with a guy and I remember it being  like a minute and then she comes out of it pissed.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:38):**  And the guy, the probation officer comes out and he goes, she wants to drop charge, drop  the charges.  Like she's dropping the charges.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:46):**  Yeah.  Her aunt's dropping the charges.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:49):**  Because she got caught up in a lie.  Right.  Yeah.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:51:54):**  Um, so after that happened, I, uh, I went to live with, with one of my school teachers  who had kind of gotten wind of what was happening.  And she had reached out to my aunt and said, Hey, like, I know that you guys are having  
**[0:52:07-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:52:07):**  issue if you ever like, just want to give her to me, you can.  And yeah, so this is my journey to act like this is where it started.  So I went to live with this beautiful lady and human being.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:52:19):**  Um, and she, she took me as foster as a foster kid.  So like, so she like, she was getting paid by the state too.  Um, so she ended up having, um, not only was she like my Matthew during junior high, but  
**[0:52:32-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:52:32):**  she was single and she had 15 horses, um, with irrigated pasture.  So that's really where, where it started for me was I ended up finally getting in place  into this house with this lady.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:52:43):**  Um, and I learned animal husbandry techniques.  I learned how to saddle and ride a horse, how to work a horse, how to train a horse,  um, how to feed, feed them, irrigate pastures, actually like take care of the pastures too,  
**[0:52:57-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:52:57):**  which I mean, it's really hard to take care of pastures with horses.  So I, I, I would love to help her now with that.  I know I'm like, but I don't also don't want to open that can of worms and telling her  
**[0:53:07-0:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:53:07):**  everything she's doing wrong, but, but I look, I really do appreciate her because she introduced  me to, so where I'm from and in, uh, in the central Valley of California, we're 30 miles  from the Sierra Nevada mountains.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:53:22):**  So she introduced me on horseback to the back country.  So I like, that's where I found my love for the land.  Um, she, she, um, she really did help me find something that was, I can be passionate about  
**[0:53:40-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:53:40):**  that.  Wasn't just the violin, which she, she helped me with that too, but I always just, I always  just never thought you could make a career out of being a musician, which I think I'm  
**[0:53:49-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:53:49):**  right.  I'm not going to argue with you there, but man, the people who have, are those really  the kind of lives that you really want?  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:53:58):**  I know it's not.  So I want to, I want to stability.  And so my thing was, I wanted to finally go to college and make a life for myself.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:54:05):**  And, and she really, she really did help me with that.  She ended up getting married and, um, and so I had always, so, so my friend Brianne  who I'd mentioned, I always wanted to really just live with her and her family because  
**[0:54:20-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:54:20):**  they have known me since I was eight years old and they've known everything I've gone  through.  And I just felt like they were the reason that, that like we finally called CPS and  
**[0:54:31-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:54:31):**  like, I felt like they supported me because of me and not because of like what I offered  them as a service, because I think the lady, the horse lady who I lived with, she really  did take me in to help her with her horses.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:54:44):**  Like that was her ulterior motive.  Yes, it saved my life and I was used to working hard.  So it wasn't, it wasn't that big of a deal, but once she got married, I really think that  
**[0:54:52-0:55:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:54:52):**  like, I mean, she was also in her sixties, so I think she got remarried in her sixties.  I really think that she just like did not want to have a child to take care of.  And so we finally were like, Hey, like I'm about to age out of foster care anyways.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:55:06):**  Can I, can I just go live with Brianne and her family?  And um, and so we did and, and, um.  Um, so I have a forever family, which I know is kind of like an animal, like a dog term  
**[0:55:19-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:55:19):**  term when you adopt a cat or a dog, that's a stray, but I mean, I am a stray, so it's  fine.  I have a forever family that has been in my life since I was, uh, like 17, eight.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:55:29):**  Well, since I was eight years old, but they I've been living with them right before I  left for college.  Um, so I'm like, my life is good.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:55:37):**  You know, I have a forever family.  And I have someone who to actually call with like adult advice.  Um, and then I have these sisters who are a hundred percent supportive and, and incapable.  
**[0:55:50-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:55:50):**  I do not have a really good relationship with any of my actual biological siblings.  And I think it's just the product of, of what happened.  So we all have talked about it and we're like, it just is what it is.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:00):**  Like we're, we're never going to be real, real siblings.  And, and we do try, but we're not going to try where it makes us uncomfortable.  So, um, yeah.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:10):**  So you, uh, you mentioned college and yeah.  Yeah.  So how did, how did you go from, from the horse and California situation?  
**[0:56:22-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:22):**  And where did that go then towards college?  Right.  So I, I had also spent my summers in high school and college, um, working in Kings Canyon  
**[0:56:32-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:32):**  national park in the Sierra Nevada, uh, like, so Sequoia, Sequoia national park, uh, taking  dudes out on these horse guided tours.  So that's like, I, I, I did those every summer and then eventually, um, eventually I went  
**[0:56:49-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:49):**  away to college and I had to like, decide like, what do I want to do for college?  And I was like, oh, I'll do animal science.  Like maybe livestock production.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:56:56):**  Um, I never wanted to do equine stuff.  I think people get surprised by that, but I just always thought there's no, like, there's  no like stable jobs in those careers.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:05):**  So I thought, um, cause I had been asked to what the new church I was part of with the  horses and stuff.  Um, there was a lot of ranchers and they were like, oh, you know how to ride a horse.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:15):**  Why don't you come to our brandings and gatherings and like help us sport cattle for the day.  So I do, I did, I get that little like cowboy cultural culture that came, came in spurts.  And I was like, man, I love this.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:28):**  Like I love when you show up to these, these ranches and I felt welcome.  Like I felt like they were so happy to have me there to help them.  I get it.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:39):**  I was free labor.  And you know, there's a whole family culture that goes around that too.  That's so different from almost so different.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:46):**  Yes.  And so that's like, when I do ranch visits, I like that feeling is I think that's what  got me hooked.  
**[0:57:52-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:57:52):**  It was like this feeling of like, even though we don't know you, you belong here because  you have value, everybody hooks to like the small town ranch vibe community.  I think that's what, what puts the hooks in most people.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:05):**  Right.  Right.  So, so I did those gatherings.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:09):**  We did the winnings and stuff like that.  And I remember like, you know, I'm always, I've always wanted to go to college because  I felt like it was my, my economic freedom ticket.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:20):**  Like, like if I truly want to be an independent person, independent on no one for my happiness,  for me, the answer was college.  Like I didn't have family.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:28):**  I didn't have any kind of assets.  College was my thing.  And I also like, I didn't really have a trade either.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:35):**  Like, you know, I, I went to college in Northern California, Chico state.  I actually ended up getting in early admission.  And for me, I was just like, I said, this is a no brainer.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:44):**  I'm going, I can live there.  I didn't have a car because I couldn't afford it.  I can go there and I can ride my bike everywhere.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:50):**  Cause it was a bike friendly campus.  So I lived like only, I lived like two blocks from campus.  I biked everywhere.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:58:58):**  I biked to get my groceries.  I biked like to go visit friends.  And I actually, you know, it's funny cause when you're a freshman year, like what do  
**[0:59:08-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:08):**  they talk about you do?  You gain your freshman 15.  I lost 15 pounds because I biked everywhere.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:14):**  It sounds like a lot more healthy lifestyle than my freshman year of college, which was  like, see who's going to go pick up fast food when classes are over.  Exactly.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:23):**  So, but the thing is I was budgeting, so I was like truly living on ham and cheese sandwiches.  I bought like the cheap chicken in like, and to be honest, vegetables are very cheap.  Like I don't think people realize that like you can cook a lot of vegetables and this  
**[0:59:38-0:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:38):**  doesn't cost a lot of money.  So I buy by default because I didn't, I didn't couldn't afford to go to the burgers and do  that all the time.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:47):**  And I needed something that was going to actually like last, like sustain me.  And so I would go to the grocery store.  I love to cook too.  
**[0:59:53-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=0:59:53):**  Like that's also very therapeutic for me.  So I wasn't playing the violin any longer.  So for me, I kind of focused that energy on the violin or not the violin on cooking.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:00:04):**  And so one I've kind of, so I went to Chico state, which has a really great regenerative  ag program, but they also just, you know, if anyone's like thinking about where to send  their kids or if you're, you're considering where to go to college, I really do think  
**[1:00:20-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:00:20):**  that Chico state solves a lot of these issues that we complain about on the podcast.  Like I took, okay, so this is what, this is what I can do in the industry now, right?  I can breed a cow.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:00:33):**  I can set up a breeding protocol.  I can have out cows.  I can decide what genetics are going to improve the herd.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:00:41):**  I can not only slaughter a cow, but I can butcher it up to all those primals and box  it up and know what those scientific muscles are called and how to cut them up into like  ribeye steaks.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:00:53):**  I also know how to work animals.  I also know how to drive any type of tractor.  I ended up working at the university farm.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:01):**  So, so we learned how to drive an articulated loader.  I could, I could feed a mixed tub of total mixed ration into bunks.  And I also, we had the pasture and the rangeland.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:14):**  So I understood pasture management and also rangeland management.  And I think that's where I really excelled was when I would get out in those fields and  take those measurements.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:25):**  And I would, I would, I would look at the the forage IDs and what, how it was contributing  to our herd.  I was really able to, for me, those connections were like such common sense.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:36):**  Like it was like, oh yeah, like this is the cheapest form of feed.  So why wouldn't we feed that to our cow?  Right.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:42):**  Why would we go get corn that's expensive and do that?  And so that's really where that started.  We also had an organic dairy.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:49):**  So I learned a lot about organic system planning, which really is like kind of the same principles  as regenerative ag.  If you look at it, it's like really holistic planning.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:01:59):**  And so I, yeah, so I learned that we had to take like a mechanics class.  We had to take a woodworking class.  Like, so I learned like all of that electrical plumbing, laying cement.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:02:11):**  And I mean, everything that I think you learn either from your father, you know, I learned  in my college education, which is like very unheard of.  Right.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:02:22):**  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Like how long was the program that you were in?  
**[1:02:26-1:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:02:26):**  How long is it typically?  So it's four years, but it ended up taking me longer.  So I ended up, we ended up having a desk.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:02:33):**  So my forever brother ended up passing away after my second year of college.  And it kind of, it broke me.  And I finally, I ended up like taking a year off of school, coming back half time.  
**[1:02:47-1:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:02:47):**  And then that's when I really started getting involved in college of ag and in working forwards.  Being a lot, to be honest, I thought I was going to be at a feedlot system.  Like I really thought there's feedlots in California that I think would hire me.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:02):**  And if that doesn't work either, I can be a nutritionist.  I'll just go to grad school and get my master's degree in nutrition and then do consulting  that way.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:12):**  Cause there's also where I'm from ton of dairies, conventional dairies.  And so they always need a nutritionist to improve their total mixed ration and find  a cheaper outside feed sources.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:23):**  So like a lot of the things like they would feed, uh, like coal oranges or just like almond  holes was a huge thing that they fed.  So I thought, okay, I know how all of these things work.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:34):**  I know the crude protein, I know the total digestible nutrients in this thing.  I can formulate a mixed ration.  I'm going to do that.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:41):**  Well, uh, so I ended up, so I ended up thinking that that's what was going to happen, but  it didn't.  And I'm really thankful that I wasn't too controlling of me having to be in the feedlot  
**[1:03:51-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:03:51):**  system because when I interned at a feedlot, I learned a lot and I'm really grateful for  the connections that I got with the feedlot because they gave me some really good advice  as far as being mentors, but it was like the lifestyle 60 to 90 hour work weeks.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:05):**  And it was just like, there's, there's no mental health taken in account for, and there  was like no work life balance.  Like you, when you're in the feedlot system, um, and I have girlfriends who are in it and  
**[1:04:17-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:17):**  I'm really proud of them as being feel up managers, but you know, there, there's not  even enough time to sleep well, like you, you don't have time to do a full eight hour  sleep if you want to have a life.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:29):**  And, and, um, and so that was for me, my emotional awareness was like, I don't like, I can't  do that for 40 years.  There's no way I can do that for a year and that's probably it.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:40):**  Um, and so they offered me a job at the feed mill and I was like, you know, I really want  to do management.  I don't want to be sitting on a desk and get fat.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:48):**  Like I literally said that I was like, I don't want a desk job.  Like I don't, I don't want to be sedentary.  Like I want to be out.  
**[1:04:54-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:04:54):**  And so, um, I ended up graduating and then Joel and I met in college.  We actually worked at the beef unit together.  He was my boss.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:02):**  He was a herdsman and it was so funny.  Cause when I met him, he had no idea what my background was.  Like he, he knew I had done this internship with Harris ranch, which was a hundred thousand  
**[1:05:14-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:14):**  animal feed lot, and he was just like really impressed with me.  Like he just thought, you know, CK is cool.  And I was like, I love that.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:22):**  Like that's, that's sexy.  Um, and I remember like, yes, like I'm finally, I'm finally being valued by people who don't  know my background.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:33):**  So they don't have this weird, here's this stray.  Who's trying to make it in the world.  And so like, I feel like I just don't want to ever have that negative connotation associated  
**[1:05:44-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:44):**  with me that would hinder my success.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I do absolutely understand what you're saying.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:05:52):**  Yeah.  So, so for me, that was my first, me getting the job at the beef unit after doing the internship  at Harris ranch was like the first thing for me to get experience.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:01):**  Cause I was like, yeah, I know how to ride horses and I know how to work cattle, but  it is very minimal.  And it, to be honest, I wouldn't even feel comfortable putting it on my resume.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:10):**  The reason that I did get, I will say the reason I got that, that, that internship at  Harris, which is like a very revered internship.  There was actually six other guys who had applied for the same internship that summer.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:21):**  And I remember the reason that I, I even got considered as because I knew how to saddle  a horse.  Isn't that funny?  
**[1:06:28-1:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:28):**  Yeah.  And none of the other guys did, or because you were a woman and you did.  Well, I, I don't know, actually, I don't want to make any assumptions.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:39):**  But I think that they didn't, like, I think that they didn't, I think it didn't have anything  to do with me being a woman.  Cause I think they would actually probably prefer to man because it's hard work.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:49):**  Oh yeah, for sure.  There's still an inclination to not consider a woman for a job like that because it might  be too hard.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:06:57):**  Oh, absolutely.  And it's so funny because the REIT, so they actually, they made me saddle the horse in  front of like a group of students.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:07):**  So I was like getting interviewed with like this huge viewing audience.  And I remember just like, I wasn't not, I wasn't even like hesitant about it because  when I worked that summer job in Sequoia National Park, every day I had to saddle 40  
**[1:07:22-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:22):**  horses and then saddle them.  So you understand how to be proficient at saddling horses for the whole summer.  And I had done that for three summers at this time.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:31):**  And so I was like, super, I got this.  And so I remember like, yeah.  But I also think like, confidence was a huge thing in me getting that internship.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:41):**  And I realized that like, there's actually a lot of things that I probably wouldn't have  gotten if I had not like almost like not faked my confidence because it was true authentic  confidence.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:51):**  But I do think like, like doing this interview, to be honest, I was like, I don't want to  do this.  Like I've been anxious about it all morning.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:07:59):**  I don't want to share this very, very crazy life that I had that doesn't represent who  I am anymore.  But I am grateful for who I am today because of it.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:11):**  And I think it's really hard to fake confidence sometimes.  But I think we really need to try to do it because it's just going to make you realize  like when you try something new, it's usually like you're in your head why you hesitate.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:26):**  Right.  And then once you do it, you're like, that was so easy.  Why was I worried about it?  
**[1:08:31-1:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:31):**  You know?  It usually feels great.  I have a senior in high school.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:34):**  We've been, we went shopping.  We went shopping yesterday and we actually talked a lot about this last night.  Like sometimes you're going to go do things that are scary.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:40):**  Yeah.  I mean, they just plain suck.  And, and really the, the, the thing that sucks is the thinking about it all day long.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:46):**  It is.  That was the worst part.  When you do it, then you're done and it feels so good.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:51):**  Not only is it done and you feel proud and it's off your chest or whatever and, and,  and own it.  Yeah.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:08:58):**  Like basically own it, whatever it is you're doing, even if it's scary.  Yeah.  Um, so, so really, and if I could even like unpack that interview with, with Troy and  
**[1:09:10-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:09:10):**  I love Troy, he was actually mentored me towards what my career is now and doing, uh, working  with people really.  And uh, Troy, like he came up with this gruff, I'm just a little cowboy and I got to prove  
**[1:09:23-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:09:23):**  to you that this is going to be hard.  I kind of want to scare you away from this.  And I remember the only reason that he gave me the internship is because he is very particular  
**[1:09:31-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:09:31):**  about the way that he put back his saddle pad.  And I noticed it.  Um, he put it back up like, so it's like a lot of people will, so they'll put their saddle  
**[1:09:41-1:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:09:41):**  on the saddle, the horn, uh, to store it or whatever it's called the rack, sorry.  And then, and then they'll put their pad on top of the saddle because the way you, you,  um, the way that you saddle a horse is you, you go and put the pad down, you align it,  
**[1:09:59-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:09:59):**  and then you throw the saddle down and you have to adjust the sat, the pad under the  saddle.  So sits on the horses, withers well, and then you tighten up the cinch.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:10:08):**  So, so what I did was I normally put the cinch back the way that he had it buckled originally,  but I put the saddle pad, the sweat side up so that the heat would evaporate off of it  and it wouldn't cause like his saddle, the leather to like get ruined by like the moisture.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:10:27):**  And he was like, that's the reason I'm hiring you.  And I just remember like, it's such, I was like, that's really ridiculous.  So that's where you're hiding it.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:10:34):**  But now looking back on it, like, yeah, attention to detail is, is great.  Like yes, you know how to saddle the horse, but do you know how to put it away correctly?  Like are you paying attention to these little things that, that I have done intentionally  
**[1:10:49-1:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:10:49):**  for a reason?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:52-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:10:52):**  It's important.  And it's something that, that not, not many people do.  And it shows, it shows your drive and desire to, to want to do the job.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:01):**  I mean, it honestly, it kind of shows confidence to, to take a chance to do something that  you weren't really asked to do.  Yeah.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:09):**  Yeah.  Yep.  So, so I did that internship.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:12):**  I really did learn a lot.  I learned a lot about people.  I learned about actually like processing like a large amount of cattle.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:18):**  Like there were days we, we processed like 1400 you know, a 1400 head pin of cattle in  one day, which it took us, it took us an hour to do 120.  So we would work like 12 hour days.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:30):**  And I remember just working along these guys who went, oh, they busted their asses and  they really did work hard.  But that's when I knew I would get respect as well is as long as I could show up and  
**[1:11:41-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:41):**  work just as hard as them.  Right.  Like didn't come up, show up with an ego.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:46):**  I didn't come up as like this college educated person who, who, you know, I never saw them  as not educated.  I just was like, I don't, you guys know so much more than me and I want to learn from  
**[1:11:56-1:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:11:56):**  you guys.  And they, they really did finally, when they broke down their barriers with me, they were  like, we have so much respect because you're actually willing to shovel the manure with  
**[1:12:05-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:05):**  us out of the alleyway instead of just like washing us do it.  Right.  And I think that's huge too, for people who want to get involved, who were just like,  
**[1:12:15-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:15):**  oh, I don't want to make you uncomfortable and just, so I'll just watch.  And it's like, no, you should get in there.  Like if you, if they don't want you in there, they'll tell you, we're like, we, we, we admire  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:25):**  the hustle, but like, this isn't safe for you.  So please don't be in here.  Like, they're always going to want you to work as hard as they are.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:31):**  Get in and get your boots dirty and don't be afraid to ask questions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:37):**  And I remember I would ask them really like, now that I, now I know the answers.  I'm like, oh, I can't believe I asked that.  But but it's like, they also were like, CK was new.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:45):**  She was like fresh and she, but she also had this like willingness to learn.  And, and to be honest, I ended up being really good with the crew.  And like when I would write pens, I would like, so you would learn how to pick out animals  
**[1:12:58-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:12:58):**  in the pen who were sick.  And I remember that.  So you look at their eyes, ears, nose, and toes, and sometimes be holes.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:13:06):**  And then you would also look at their behavior, which, you know, I'm the master of behavior.  And so you would, so they would, they would isolate themselves from the herd.  Their head would probably be, be down and their ears will be down.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:13:20):**  You could tell they're sick.  And then, then we would know, okay, that animal is showing signs of sickness.  Like let's sort them out and take them to the hospital crew so that we can take their  
**[1:13:31-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:13:31):**  temperature and figure out what they need.  And so I did learn, you know, in the feedlot situation, you learn all of those things.  You learn how to process a new cow or steer.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:13:43):**  And then you also learn how to doctor them, how to work with people, how to, how to mix  a ration.  And it really is this huge, like well-organized machine.  
**[1:13:54-1:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:13:54):**  Like it's very impressive what feedlots are able to do in a 90 to 120 day period to finish  a like 800 pound animal to, to 1300 pounds.  Like it's, it's kind of crazy.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:05):**  And I know we...  It's got to be a well-oiled machine for sure.  Exactly.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:09):**  Like it cannot break also.  So I do, I do think that it's, it was just for me, it was the perfect environment for  me to learn a lot all at once.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:19):**  So then I got that confidence.  I ended up going back to school.  I had worked at a restaurant, Olive Garden, for the last three years.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:27):**  And then my final year in college, I was like, I want to work at the beef unit.  I want to work at the university farm so that I can put on my resume so that I can get a  big girl job and, and, and not, you know, be a server after I have my college degree.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:41):**  And so I worked at the beef unit.  I learned everything about seed stock operation and selling like bulls.  And then, you know, working with semen and breeding cows and doing...  
**[1:14:54-1:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:14:54):**  We also saw...  My title was, I was a research assistant.  So we actually had some feed trials that we did with some spent distillers grains where  
**[1:15:03-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:03):**  we were finishing low line cattle.  So they're just like midget cows.  Right.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:09):**  I hope I don't offend anyone.  So the Aberdeen cows, sorry, not the midget cows.  So we had these, these low line genetics that we were trying to do some feed efficiency  
**[1:15:19-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:19):**  trials with these like grow safe bunks.  And so I got to own that process.  And for me, that was like so empowering that I could be part of the scientific community  
**[1:15:32-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:32):**  and in like, and use what I've known to like improve the beef industry.  So like, it was like, yeah, we probably should use more moderate framed animals if we want  them to finish sooner.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:47):**  Right.  Which is what they're discovering, at least with the grass fed side is we don't need these  beast animals.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:15:56):**  We can, we can have both.  There's room for everything.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:01):**  So I went on to do that.  Super excited about that.  I was actually really sad when that ended.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:06):**  Like I remember crying so hard because I was just so happy about the experience and I wanted  to keep it going.  And then, so Joel and I were together.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:15):**  We were just dating at the time.  And then we ended up moving to my hometown, California.  I got, I ended up getting a sales job at an animal health, animal health company selling  
**[1:16:29-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:29):**  like drugs and stuff like that.  And I hated it.  I was like, Oh man, this, I ended up like being inside sales.  
**[1:16:37-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:37):**  So I ended up being in a cubicle for nine hours a day.  And I was like, this is not what I want.  I want to be ranching.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:43):**  Like, I want to be out helping ranchers to figure out better ways to improve their life.  And so I ended up quitting animal health international because it was a very toxic work environment.  And they were like, CK is going to say yes to everything that we ask her of.  
**[1:16:58-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:16:58):**  So I'm going to give her three reps when we usually only give one rep, one rep to work  with.  So I was doing the job of three people.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:06):**  Um, it was, it was hard.  Like I was, I finally was like, I can't do anymore.  And I had asked for help and you know me, if I asked for help, it means it's really  
**[1:17:15-1:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:15):**  bad because I'm usually can find out the answer myself.  And so when they told me like, we're not going to help you, I was like, well, peace out.  Like if you're not going to help me, I'm not going to be here.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:25):**  And I know what that's like not getting help.  And so I did, I quit.  And I told him, I was like, I quit.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:30):**  I think I can't, I'm not even doing my two weeks.  Like I don't care.  I'm not going to put this on my resume anyways.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:35):**  Um, like this is, this is not a good job to, to recommend to anyone either.  And um, then I ended up being like a pistachio broker for a few months.  Um, and I was like, whatever, I just need something that pays the bills because I was  
**[1:17:50-1:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:50):**  not going to do unemployment.  I was like, I'm not doing that.  Like I just needed to do something.  
**[1:17:53-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:17:53):**  I was even willing to do serving again because it's really good, fast money.  Um, and I was happy interacting with the people.  So I was like, okay, I'll do, I'm going to, I got this pistachio broker job.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:03):**  So it was grower relations.  So it was like, oh yeah, totally up CK's alley working with pistachio farmers.  Um, and then, and then I ended up getting recruited by Pasture Map by, from the founders  
**[1:18:14-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:14):**  are like, Hey, like we know that you're a Chico State grad.  We know that you have this background in pasture and rangeland management.  And then we've also heard that you're really good with people.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:26):**  And we hire you.  And then I told Joel, cause they had just like, they sent a random emails like who the  hell are these people at pasture?  
**[1:18:33-1:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:33):**  Wow.  Yeah.  And I remember telling Joel, should I do it?  
**[1:18:36-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:36):**  He's like, yeah, you're not.  He's like, you don't want to be a pistachio broker.  Like that is not your calling.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:42):**  And I started laughing and I was like, it's a remote job.  Like what does that mean?  And he's like, oh, I think it means you work from home.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:49):**  And I was like, you don't have to go to work.  And for me it was mind blowing.  Right.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:18:53):**  Well now it's like, everyone knows what that's like.  But for me, for that was, you know, that was over four years ago because I was a contractor  before they actually fully hired me on.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:03):**  Because they wanted to make sure that I was going to actually make them revenue and which  I would have done the same thing.  But I remember telling Joel, like, this is just so good, too good to be true.  
**[1:19:13-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:13):**  And he's like, babe, you've worked so hard for this.  Like you deserve to like work for something that you're happy.  He's like, I get to work with ranchers, like ranchers from all over the country.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:22):**  And it really has been such a blessing.  And you know, it is still a startup.  There are times when you think the company is not going to make it, like we need to change  
**[1:19:35-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:35):**  our trajectory.  We need to focus on something else.  But it's like, for me, I've learned what a healthy work culture looks like.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:43):**  And I want to share that with the world.  Like I wake up in the morning and I'm so excited to like log into my computer and like see  what's going on, see what the ranchers need, see what my teammates need, and then also  
**[1:19:56-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:19:56):**  give feedback.  And like, right now we're getting a lot of dairy customers and I'm like, hey, like we  don't really do a lot of dairy stuff.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:07):**  Like we don't do any components tracking.  We don't do any somatic sales stuff.  So like stuff that dairy people fits with their goals.  
**[1:20:14-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:14):**  And I'm like, if we have all these people signing up, we need to build it for them.  They're like, yeah, let's do it.  So it's really exciting that I can see the writing on the wall and they believe me like,  
**[1:20:23-1:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:23):**  for sure.  Yeah.  To be, to be working with a company that's, that's small enough still to understand what's  
**[1:20:30-1:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:30):**  really growing it and the needs of the people is just awesome.  When you start talking about it, you kind of light up.  That's not something that anybody on the podcast is going to see, but you know, yeah.  
**[1:20:41-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:41):**  So I always like talk it down as like, oh yeah, I just worked for, you know, we'd keep  records.  It's a record keeping software.  
**[1:20:47-1:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:20:47):**  It's a very regenerative company.  Like they not only do they take care of their employees, even the past team, since we've  been sold the new team, it has the same values.  
**[1:21:00-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:00):**  Like that was the number one thing was like, Hey, like we had a great company culture.  I want to keep that.  I moved to Texas thinking that they would want me to be in their office.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:09):**  They never did.  And so I kind of probably shouldn't have moved to Texas, but I also just kind of needed that  for my own peace of mind, cause I could not do the Island any longer.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:18):**  Yeah.  And, and then when I was, you know, I was like, Hey, we're moving to Kansas and then,  and then we're moving to Idaho.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:25):**  You guys are okay with that.  They're like, CK, yeah, like you, you help these ranchers.  They're like, I would rather fire myself before I fire you.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:32):**  So it was like super, super exciting to hear that because I think there's a part of me  where it's like, when are you guys going to decide to not want me?  Like, can you just tell me?  
**[1:21:41-1:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:41):**  And you know, that's just my programming.  So I have to unlearn that I have to unlearn that.  Like what I'm doing is making an impact in the ranching industry.  
**[1:21:48-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:48):**  And, and to be honest, like with a new team, you know, they want to learn the new ropes  and ins and out of the ranchers and they want to like, they're like, why do ranchers pay  for Pashmap?  
**[1:21:59-1:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:21:59):**  And it was like, they pay for Pashmap because we fit a need.  But the reason that they stay is because we actually take care of them, like with the  relationships that we maintain with them.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:12):**  Like they're just, they're not just a paycheck.  They're they're more than that.  Like we're actually built to suit.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:17):**  Like when ranchers have needs, we'll build it for them.  If they need to talk to me, we can talk, you can talk to our other teammates as well.  Like we very much are, in my mind, I think we're changing the way that companies work  
**[1:22:32-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:32):**  internally because we do have a mental health culture where that's important.  Absolutely.  I think you guys are changing not only the way a company's working internally, but to  
**[1:22:45-1:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:45):**  me, it seems like you're changing the way a company works for, for the people, for the  clients.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[1:22:53-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:53):**  You guys are providing a specific service.  Okay.  We're providing you with this software, but not just with the software.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:22:58):**  We're going to show you how to use it.  We're going to help you use it efficiently.  And if it's not going to work for you, we're going to change it so that, yeah.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:23:05):**  Yeah.  And we're continually improving it.  So it's really exciting to see that we're invested in this in the longterm.  
**[1:23:12-1:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:23:12):**  Because our mission statement for Passion  are 100% what drives our decision-making every day.  Absolutely.  
**[1:24:02-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:24:02):**  Yep.  I mean that's all I got.  in Kansas waiting to go to Idaho to figure out Joel's veterinary life and that'll be another  
**[1:24:14-1:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:24:14):**  chapter and probably a really fun one but also really hard one but I feel confident that we  know what we're doing and if we don't we know how to ask for help. That's awesome.  Well I feel like we've kind of pushed the ticket on time already and we've got a lot of story out  
**[1:24:35-1:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:24:35):**  in a short amount of time. Do you have anything that you want to add that we haven't gone over?  No I think that's all I had. I appreciate the time that you've spent with me. I really, it was hard  for me to share the story even though I've been wanting to because I you know I think one of the  
**[1:24:53-1:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:24:53):**  things is I don't want people to pity me. I want people to be like okay she's a survivor. I can  survive too and that's what I want the main takeaway from this story to be. I really appreciate  you sharing not only with me but with everybody. I've said it once already at least today. I think  
**[1:25:09-1:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:25:09):**  it's extremely brave to be vulnerable like this and it's encouraging to other people to share  their stories because like I said you know we all we all have our things and we all have our stories  and we all have those moments where we think am I scaring you with my story? Yes but just simply  
**[1:25:25-1:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:25:25):**  your bravery and your willingness to share that with everybody is is fantastic and I can't thank  you enough for for letting me do this today. Awesome thank you Tanya. Hey guys Red Hills  Rancher here editing after the fact. That was such an inspiring story. I'm really proud to know CK.  
**[1:25:44-1:26:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Special-2-CK-ev2dfm#t=1:25:44):**  She's a wonderful young lady and I think she's doing great things for the community and for  regenerative agriculture as a whole. We sure appreciate your support and come back next Monday  for another episode of Ranching Reboot. Red Hills Rancher out.

CK has known today's guest for quite a long time and she has to take the lead on this  one and I was more than happy to let her.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:03):**  So here we go with Brittany Colebush.  Hi Cole, how are you?  I'm good.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:09):**  I'm good.  I thought I was going to be on the tail end of my grazing season and it seems like I'm  just in the middle.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:17):**  Things are crazy right now.  But I am thrilled.  You know, I'm thrilled.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:26):**  Could you just for our listeners, so we have Brittany Colebush today, so wonderful grazer  and a beautiful person.  So could you tell us where you're located mainly and what do you do for the most part?  
**[0:01:40-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:40):**  I know you have a lot of other enterprises, but the main one that you're concentrated  on.  Sure.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:48):**  I'll just introduce myself.  My name is Brittany Colebush.  I go by Cole or BCB and I am the owner operator of Shepherd's Land and Livestock and we are  
**[0:01:59-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:01:59):**  a prescribed grazing business out of the Ojai Valley in Southern California, about an hour  and 20 minutes north of Los Angeles.  We don't just graze for hire, but we also have an education and training wing for next  
**[0:02:17-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:02:17):**  year's grazers.  And I also consult with private and public land managers and owners on how we can holistically  steward land and how animals are a part of that.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:02:34):**  You have quite a team that you work with, right, that you manage?  Yeah.  So in my passion and pursuits, kind of weaving together all of the projects that I've had  
**[0:02:48-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:02:48):**  over the course of my career of 11 years now, not just managing a contract grazing business  early on in my career, but going into education and training and developing this project called  Grazing School of the West.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:03:07):**  Really my passion has been how do we support next generation grazers that come from my  own personal backgrounds, right?  So part of my business is that training piece.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:03:20):**  And I've been able to informally, not thinking I was going to actually launch my actual training  wing of the business, this year we've jumped into training and I've built out a really  incredible team of shepherds.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:03:38):**  And we're creating a really dynamic way of how people can work on the land, learn at  the same time, and also have lives outside of being in the sheep camp.  Right, because that does exist, right?  
**[0:03:56-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:03:56):**  There's some misconceptions that that's not a thing.  Well we have to make it a thing or this isn't going to work.  So I'm trying to practice what I preach and all my shepherd team.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:04:07):**  I mean we're a family and my number one motto in my business is no burnout.  And that requires all of us to take care of each other and remind each other that we need  to hydrate.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:04:22):**  You know heat exhaustion is a big thing and so one of the things is like no burnout means  we have to make sure we're all hydrated.  But then also hydrated in like heart and hydrated in social interaction and hydrated in all  
**[0:04:39-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:04:39):**  the passions and things that we love outside of our work.  So yeah I think quality of life is really important when we think about regenerative  anything.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:04:51):**  And I think what we're doing right now is redefining how we can be in agriculture and  in land stewardship and quality of life is everything.  And of course I have a lot of work to do around that CK because you know I'm a single owner  
**[0:05:13-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:05:13):**  operator of this, managing a big team of people and animals.  And I have another business so I practice what you're preaching right?  So you have to learn how to be the beacon for what you're what you're wanting to do  
**[0:05:27-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:05:27):**  right?  Yeah absolutely.  So you know taking time to enjoy the things that I love outside of what I do on the daily  
**[0:05:37-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:05:37):**  it's been really important.  And I'm trying to find that work life balance and I think that's really important to talk  about as much as the technical and practical things about our business.  
**[0:05:49-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:05:49):**  I think that the that quality of life piece is really important especially if we want  to attract new people more people into this work and bridge urban and rural through this  work.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:06:00):**  Right do you think there's some small actionable things that other ranchers who may not have  this culture set in place could like it's any advice for them of like what they could  start thinking of doing or maybe like even I think a lot of times that ranchers are just  
**[0:06:16-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:06:16):**  so busy or anyone who's in livestock that they're not thinking of how they can make  these changes and they think it's a huge overhaul and I think maybe that's not the case.  That's a really good question.  
**[0:06:33-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:06:33):**  My answer to that is an invitation to be a part of a cultural change and awareness and  calling out our own judgments of basically this.  Traditionally it's mad respect for the rancher who hasn't stopped working in 20 plus years.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:07:02):**  You know the person who works the hardest and the most is the person who is going to  get to the top or had been at the top or whatever you know or the like has the most respect.  Maybe that was the story a couple generations ago but what if we actually commend and applaud  
**[0:07:21-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:07:21):**  our comrades who are exhibiting what we want in our lives such as time off where it's like  what you went away for three day weekend with your family fishing awesome awesome you know  instead of making a judgment like well what what the heck they were on a contract in the  
**[0:07:43-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:07:43):**  middle of you know San Francisco how why were they gone it's like instead of judging someone  or an outfit that isn't you know doing status quo but like celebrating that and I found  that that has been really helpful and now my team thinks higher of me when I take time  
**[0:08:05-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:08:05):**  off even if it's like four hours to myself they're like way to go you're doing it you  know and I think that that that's something I think that's something that we can do that's  a practical thing that anybody in this work can do is just say is is like applaud and  
**[0:08:23-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:08:23):**  encourage and support this change in our agriculture.  I was I was listening to another another podcast and he's talking about gratitude and just  like living your life with just small gratitude every day and like it's even in the way that  
**[0:08:44-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:08:44):**  you frame how you say things like like oh I have to go to work you should say no I get  to go to work like there's people who probably don't get that privilege right or you know  so if you if you frame it that way then that energy is just transferred to a more positive  
**[0:09:01-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:09:01):**  impact instead of like oh I need to take time off I'm so tired just like oh I I get to take  time off that's something that I actually can allow to myself and not feel guilty about  it because I feel like there's just so much guilt and shame around work-life balance yeah  
**[0:09:20-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:09:20):**  yeah.  I totally agree and I think that language is so important and and and just how yeah  exactly how we frame how we frame things in communication to anyone else around us but  
**[0:09:38-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:09:38):**  ourselves you know having affirmative affirmative ways of saying things I mean you know that  we're getting esoteric in that like a manifestation but I totally believe that I totally believe  that if we embody what we would like to achieve or what we would like to be in something that  
**[0:10:01-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:10:01):**  that it becomes more familiar and we are basically priming priming the soil for positive the  conditions for good things to grow right I think that I like that and I think I think  we adopt that attitude in general is just like how do I make this how do I lead by example  
**[0:10:25-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:10:25):**  and you're stoked about doing the hard things.  It's really hard to especially if you're like if you're in a rush you don't have time to  really like do it like I call body stance where you're really understanding where your  
**[0:10:39-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:10:39):**  tune is like today sometimes I go back to old behaviors or just reactions where I'm  just like oh like this person's making me angry and so my attitude towards that is negative  and so I think a lot of times you just have to reset and realize what is this coming from  
**[0:10:59-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:10:59):**  is this like old generational traditional kind of behaviors or even habits that I'm  I'm trying to break you know.  So if we can backpedal just a little bit I want to know how you got into ag is it 11  
**[0:11:18-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:11:18):**  years ago is what you said how did you get involved with doing the targeted grazing for  fire management and just getting involved if you said you had a non-traditional background  is that right?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah well I'm gonna do my best to be brief on this because I talk a lot about my past  and how I got into this I think it's better for your folks in this but I'm more excited  about the present and the future.  
**[0:11:47-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:11:47):**  Especially because it was so long ago I'm right well we morph into so many different  things as we engage with the world and new contexts but essentially the long and short  of it is is that I've been on a meandering journey but very very very clear that my calling  
**[0:12:10-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:12:10):**  has been to be what I call a modern-day shepherdess you know shepherding animals people and projects  and it's been a very dynamic journey.  I am a non-traditional agrarian I grew up in Southern California in a beach town you  
**[0:12:28-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:12:28):**  know in North County San Diego I'm the oldest of six daughters and geez you know I my passion  has always been culture and preserving culture in a rapidly developing world and my big kind  of question in in defining that for myself has led me to many different places around  
**[0:12:54-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:12:54):**  the world and when I was 19 years old I wasn't ready for college and I had the opportunity  to work my butt off and go to Africa I went to Tanzania climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and  for the first time got to really see pastoralism in in practice with the Maasai people and  
**[0:13:17-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:13:17):**  I think that was kind of where the seed was planted right and I think that the seed was  already there CK like it was like oh yeah like somewhere inside me pastoralism is a  part of my story but yeah kind of where it was fertilized and germinated right germinated  
**[0:13:36-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:13:36):**  yeah and then the last 10 years has been watering that seed yeah you know be where I'm at now  so you know that's kind of the baseline of it I my my travels and education in agroecology  led to holistic management and really diving into holistic management practice and I became  
**[0:14:04-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:14:04):**  a credited professional and trainer with the savory Institute have done some work with  HMI and have been able to practice on the ground early on in my my career becoming the  project manager and helping to start up a larger contract grazing business called Star  
**[0:14:24-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:14:24):**  Creek Land Stewards in the early 2010s and we were grazing in big urban spaces in the  Bay Area in California and that's kind of where I got my start on the ground in project  management and having grazing animals like right there on the urban periphery and after  
**[0:14:46-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:14:46):**  Star Creek Land Stewards just really wanting to see how I could answer this question the  new question how do we preserve culture in a rapidly you know developing world how do  we create pathways for new people to have meaningful and well work because that's their  
**[0:15:03-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:15:03):**  culture is tied to food as well right yes so then I really got into wanting to learn  about how different countries are around the world are training their next generation of  practitioners on the ground with animals transhumanism and pastoralism and things like that a mentor  
**[0:15:24-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:15:24):**  of mine Fred Provenza Fred you are awesome thank you his book you want them on please  come get them on the wisdom of shepherding became kind of my bible and through the support  of him and his co-author Michelle Ray I was able to go to sorry if I butcher your name  
**[0:15:48-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:15:48):**  Michelle I was able to go to Spain and France to investigate the shepherding schools yeah  all over the Spain and France that was that were outlined in the book and big question  there was how do we can we learn from those schools and you know the West and so education  
**[0:16:12-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:16:12):**  became a big thing and it's been a huge quandary of in our context of the West can we replicate  or learn from how they do it there the answer is what I found in you know developing my  project grazing school of the West it does not work the way that it works there we can't  
**[0:16:36-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:16:36):**  we have a totally different structure what are some of the what are some of the differences  oh sorry I talk and I realize I need to shut up so you guys can interview no no it's fine  so what I what what I realized that some of the well some of the biggest differences are  
**[0:16:59-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:16:59):**  is in our educational system and in our health care system and how we are set up to really  struggle in in the United States the way we come out of school with a lot of debt right  not everybody can get out of school with a lot of debt we also don't have universal health  
**[0:17:24-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:17:24):**  care health care is very expensive for us so right off the bat the cost of living is  much higher than the cost of living say for those in Spain or France education is subsidized  greatly and and is so is health care so their cost of living is a lot lower and I I could  
**[0:17:49-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:17:49):**  cannot see how somebody who graduates from the University of California with maybe one  need of sixty two hundred thousand dollars where the debt can go and take two years in  a working apprenticeship right without much overhead how can you grave in an urban periphery  
**[0:18:08-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:18:08):**  when the cost to live in the urban periphery is so high how can you ever afford to buy  anything if you can't make a salary that will allow for you to put money away it just it  absolutely doesn't work the same way and so I've had a really hard time wanting to go  
**[0:18:30-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:18:30):**  out into the world and train people on how to get into this until I have tested the model  in my own business and and that is really what has manifested my my business shepherdess  land and livestock is like it's a proof of concept yeah so it won't discourage anyone

**[0:19:15-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:19:15):**  about agricultural practices well not in a formalized way at this point maybe just like  onlookers or well so I'll give you an example okay uh social media does incredible things  by weird algorithms and yes scenes of people through people so yeah I think I've had I've  
**[0:19:39-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:19:39):**  had exposure to audiences I don't think that most ranchers or rural agrarians have because  of my integration in urban spaces I lived in Los Angeles I've lived in San Francisco  before I moved to the OI valley I was in Los Angeles I was training in stunt performance  
**[0:20:01-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:20:01):**  really focusing on horseback riding for stunts because I needed something you know activated  in wild when I wasn't chasing sheep and goats in the urban space but I think that by being  an urban like city dweller and also being someone tied into our regenerative ag community  
**[0:20:24-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:20:24):**  and and you know I also I sit in the radical center I also have a lot of community and  conventional ag as well I just have gathered a really cool diverse group of friends and  people I know and and artists and musicians and tech people and parents and homesteaders  
**[0:20:46-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:20:46):**  and you know I think that that I think that living in the urban space has really helped  to open and broaden the the audience and scope and scale of of people getting to know about  this and social social media has been a big part of that but then also just being out  
**[0:21:06-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:21:06):**  in the world conversations are pretty cool yeah that emerge and you know it's always  like what do you do and I'm like oh shoot do we have like an hour do I give you the  abridged version or yeah yeah yeah so I just say I'm a cattle rancher or a used or a carbon  
**[0:21:27-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:21:27):**  cycling technician yeah exactly yeah exactly I am oh gosh yeah there's so many ways you  can spin it right totally I so back to the herb like urban how do you the education of  non-tradition has that been a demand from people like I guess it's like are people really  
**[0:21:49-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:21:49):**  curious do they seeing all these absolutely so in the first year of my grazing I've had  the opportunity to collaborate with the Ohio Valley fire safe council and the fire safe  council is driving initiatives for community driven community supported ways to create  
**[0:22:08-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:22:08):**  fire safety and resilience in the valley and the main initiative the community supported  grazing program that I'm also directing has been a really cool way to get information  out about how animals can participate in managing our open spaces oh hi Valley burned the the  
**[0:22:36-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:22:36):**  periphery of oh I burned in the Thomas backfire in 2017 and that really was a wake-up call  to the community and brought a lot of people together and though the fire safe council  is really working to take that energy from the community and and and push for really  
**[0:22:57-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:22:57):**  impactful projects and this is this project is one of them so this was our first demonstration  year we did over five different demonstration sites with community stakeholders in some  of the largest open space in OHA and one of the coolest projects we did is on an open  
**[0:23:17-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:23:17):**  space I think it was a few hundred acres we demonstrated on I personally graze about oh  gosh 25 30 acres and then another local grazer shout out Ventura brush goats did the other  did another 30 or so and that open space at the Krishna birdie foundation of America was  
**[0:23:43-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:23:43):**  is the client it's the open space that everybody sees coming into oh hi it's like the main  artery coming into oh hi and as you can imagine during COVID people are fleeing the city on  the weekends to go and experience nature and they come to oh hi and the first thing that  
**[0:24:01-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:24:01):**  they see over the course of them we were there for several weeks but over there we were there  on the fourth of July weekend and thousands and thousands of people were passing our blocks  of our herd of sheep and goats and I would say that that time the shepherds like one  
**[0:24:22-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:24:22):**  of their biggest their biggest jobs during the day was just like chatting it up with  people who'd stop and take pictures and ask questions and were just like so excited and  exhilarated to see these animals and curious like people are really curious like what is  
**[0:24:41-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:24:41):**  going like what is this like why are you doing this and I think just exposure and people  seeing it right there is like the biggest educational opportunity and having a shepherd  on site who can explain and really be a liaison or an advocate or an educator is is super  
**[0:25:02-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:25:02):**  key to spreading this because now just through conversation conversations proliferate and  if children are interested their parents are going to know about it and then the parents  are going to see it right yeah so it's like for me it's like teach the kids get the kids  
**[0:25:20-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:25:20):**  really excited about seeing the animals and the parents will follow and it's just it's  so cool to see that we are bridging we're making we're making links just by being in  areas that there is a there are kind of people coming through  
**[0:25:37-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:25:37):**  I think um you know I'm a California native as well and so I seeing all these fires every  year it just seems like it gets worse and worse and um I'm really excited to see the  impact that will happen with what you're doing at a local level and I really hope that other  
**[0:26:00-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:26:00):**  communities just kind of take what you're doing and want to model that out and scale  so that so that we can get California in a little bit better shape as far as how the  forest lands and vegetation is being managed here here well that's yeah I you nailed it  
**[0:26:18-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:26:18):**  I mean that's that's the goal of this program yeah there are fire safe councils all over  the state there are fire districts all over the state if what we're doing is we're documenting  our process in developing a model that can and including stakeholders the actual policy  
**[0:26:35-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:26:35):**  probably makers yes yes we have the Ohio mayor supporting we have we have our county supervisor  supporting we have the local Ventura fire department the fire district supporting we  have the local land Conservancy supporting and a myriad of private landowners and nonprofits  
**[0:26:57-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:26:57):**  that's exactly what we need to do the bottom line is fire and natural disasters don't give  a damn about board of property lines they don't watershed don't care you know it so  you know we have to think beyond fences yeah we have to break down borders and boundaries  
**[0:27:22-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:27:22):**  and recognize that we are all a part of localized watersheds and ecologies that there are there  dynamics that we need to recognize if we're going to meet all of we're gonna meet the  challenges of natural disaster we have to band together and we have to stitch acres  
**[0:27:44-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:27:44):**  together in our approaches for land management and so that's the community approach in getting  stakeholders well that is my answer it you can answer it it's always interesting to see  who who's who's calling in the middle of the day when you have sheep and goats in public  
**[0:28:04-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:28:04):**  spaces I got a I got a shepherd so we're good let's see let's see what the Shepherd said  one sec that's kind of like a cows on the highway call but maybe a little bit worse  man yeah goats in your garden heck no actually goats getting out can give you good press  
**[0:28:26-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:28:26):**  we got on the front page of the newspaper a couple months ago and it was really great  because it got spun in a really nice way the neighbors loved it I mean the neighborhood  got like people ran out of their houses and were hurting the sheep and goats unfortunately  
**[0:28:43-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:28:43):**  my shepherd and I weren't far off and so we were there moments but the community was stoked  the the local police officer was stoked too I said hey hey would you would you take the  back well you know behind the herd while we go down two lanes and just make sure we're  
**[0:29:00-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:29:00):**  good and then I had I was in the front and it was like a parade it was like a total parade  of neighbors and that article was great it talked about what we were doing and how to  support because we're gonna have a fall fundraiser called a goat fund me okay for neighbors more  
**[0:29:17-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:29:17):**  about that yes yes yes yes oh gosh you could sorry not to interrupt you we got we got a  shepherd on duty and we're all good and so a part of the community supported grazing  program effort is how do we create resilience and funding for the grazing services and all  
**[0:29:45-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:29:45):**  of the things that need to be done for the grazing services to work which is partnering  with a local nonprofit called the crew and it trains youth on really hard hand clearing  work really quite honestly it's just like what happens after fire cleanup a lot of mechanical  
**[0:30:05-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:30:05):**  hand crew stuff so we can work with this nonprofit they can do a lot of fence clearing for us  we can build fence and then we can graze so part of our what one of our big needs is is  we need money to work with the nonprofit and to pay for the grazing services so we are  
**[0:30:22-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:30:22):**  looking at different ways to fundraise and create that resilient funding mechanism that's  year after year there's a lot of money at state level for fire prevention so the fire  safe council is able to apply for those grants and we'll get grants and such and then we  
**[0:30:41-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:30:41):**  want the community to adopt this and have and have a stakeholder into this and and one  way to do that is if you put money towards something then you're you know you're gonna  want to care about something if you're paying for it right our goal is if we raise money  
**[0:31:00-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:31:00):**  from our community we are going to be able to graze more acres so it's not just the landowners  who can afford the grazing but it can the cost will be mitigated and spread through  a multitude of properties instead of just one here one there one there and the cost  
**[0:31:22-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:31:22):**  can be reduced because we are not transporting animals on trucks and trailers instead we're  just hurting them and as we by hurting them instead of putting them on trucks and trailers  it we're saving a lot of money and we're saving we're you know probably less stress too right  
**[0:31:39-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:31:39):**  well yeah exactly yeah yeah absolutely less stress on the animals us herders love it people  love it um it's price of gas yeah less carbon use yeah i mean you can you can list all the  issues yes it's gonna take a long time to stitch together the whole entire corridor  
**[0:32:00-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:32:00):**  around the valley but already because of our success this year i'm very hopeful that our  fundraising campaigns can be successful we'll raise enough money where we can graze in areas  it's almost like grazing for all some people can't afford the grazing uh and some people  
**[0:32:17-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:32:17):**  can but if your neighbor isn't doing the fire clearance that you're doing right you know  it benefits everybody if everybody's in you know so we are looking at different strategies  for the fundraising where it's localized for neighborhoods so a neighborhood will pitch  
**[0:32:36-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:32:36):**  into a neighborhood pot of gold for grazing and then another neighborhood will pitch in  for their niche and one of the work with the fire safe council is actually doing them fine  it's called fine mapping fine priority mapping so we're looking at the behavior of fire if  
**[0:32:56-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:32:56):**  it was to come through the valley how would it how would it act in our geography um uh  and geology and all of the kind of it's a valley so it has a right how will it travel  and stuff how will it travel and then what are our what are the priorities zones if a  
**[0:33:14-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:33:14):**  fire where would this fire clearance be the most impactful and by doing that then we are  being scrupulous with the resources and putting the grazing at first in the places that are  the most important and the most impactful  
**[0:33:32-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:33:32):**  is there a way we can uh support this fundraiser like is it is there a way to like donate or  anything like that yeah absolutely so we will be having a big outreach campaign in the fall  and winter of this year okay and a part of that the hope the hope is is that we get the  
**[0:33:53-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:33:53):**  word out but not just about what ohai is doing but get the word out about this model that  is developing yes and by supporting the development of the model we'll be able to create uh essentially  assets that other other uh communities can take just like a blueprint or a road map of  
**[0:34:18-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:34:18):**  you want to start one of these here this is what you need to do and this is how we did  it and even to the very structure of a crowdfunding campaign yeah these are elements that you  need you're going to need your maps you're going to need your key stakeholders identified  
**[0:34:32-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:34:32):**  you're going to need to do pilot projects yes you know all of these things if we can  fund that that groundwork that baseline development with greater minds than just a couple grazers  and some fire safe council guys then um then then we'll be able to help other communities  
**[0:34:54-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:34:54):**  do this and that's really it's like teach the folks to fish and they'll be able to feed  the people right so amen yeah we need we need a lot more grazers i think that there's a  lot of room for smaller localized grazing operations and the only way they can be viable  
**[0:35:13-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:35:13):**  is if there's if there's consistency and security with localized contracts and keeping animals  in keeping in the animals in the valley off trucks i need to make sure that i have enough  work season all season or all year for that matter um to make it work and i would love  
**[0:35:34-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:35:34):**  to see this type of model adopted in other places and yes and folks recognize the true  value of this that it's not just fire hazard prevention but it's ecological stewardship  yes okay so a little tangent because i get so annoyed by this conversation that i have  
**[0:35:52-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:35:52):**  with some of my my ranchers who who only want to do cattle right um they'll complain about  like having brush encroachment or they have like an invasive species that's probably like  a forbed area and i'm like your solution is goats like get some goats and it's just always  
**[0:36:13-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:36:13):**  uh you know i think we all know it's a huge stigma around using goats or sheep but they  definitely do a different job than what cattle do what they're complaining about is is what  goats are born to do as being these browsers right so um i definitely would love to see  
**[0:36:30-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:36:30):**  that because i think that's a way for the ecological way we we we take care of the land  is even if it's just and not oversimplify it but like rent some goats for for a short  duration of time that's not them committing to owning goats but but they do need goats  
**[0:36:50-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:36:50):**  on their land to fix these issues um i think brian do you have that conversation with people  too all the time i mean people would rather rather hire a spray plane to come out and  spray poison you know from the air it costs hundreds of you know a lot of dollars an acre  
**[0:37:09-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:37:09):**  rather than find somebody that will bring their goats out and sheep out to manage the  brush problem and in all likelihood might even end up paying the landowner for the privilege  you know so people want an easy answer you know and a lot of times that easy answer is  
**[0:37:29-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:37:29):**  you know is the chemical in a in a container you can't buy good management or soil health  or fire in a box at the farm store and that's why that's why those things just aren't necessarily  done and yeah i call i know i said fire is a management tool and we're talking about  
**[0:37:45-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:37:45):**  using goats as a fire mitigation tool but you know fire is is one of those management  tools that's context appropriate right i am a huge fan of prescribed burns in conjunction  with prescribed grazing i think together they're beautiful combo and i would love to see the  
**[0:38:07-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:38:07):**  i believe there's a future where prescribed burns are going to be much more there we're  going to see more of them in california we just need to be supportive of a cultural shift  yes here of fire we get to do fires and it's a cultural shift where we need to go back  
**[0:38:28-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:38:28):**  to this um oh my gosh i love this um concentric ecology you know we need to we need to look  at how our culture can adopt more holistic viewpoints and relationships to uh the the  challenges that we have and if we if we can work towards changing fear of fire into understanding  
**[0:38:57-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:38:57):**  that we live in a fire ecology and we need to work with the earth to make more resilient  systems for humans to live on earth then we need to be empowered by the use of fire and  by working with fire and and respecting fire and respecting our fire ecologies we're gonna  
**[0:39:19-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:39:19):**  make we're gonna make a lot of we're gonna make a lot of change that needs to happen  and post fire grazing it goes it's hand in hand and brian you're totally right there  are many tools and many approaches and we need to look at all of them and there are

**[0:39:53-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:39:53):**  can and can't do and know what your people can do you know i've made the choice to take  on contracts that were easier in scope in terms of fence building and various challenges  because we quite frankly the animals and the people needed a moment to breathe before we  
**[0:40:13-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:40:13):**  jumped into the next contract because again it's it's about endurance quality of life  and if we can maintain our our beings being stoked on the job then we're going to be able  to do more work longer in the year we're going to be working you know hopefully through middle  
**[0:40:32-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:40:32):**  to end of november or whenever rain starts hopefully it's like tomorrow but yeah before  rain starts we're going to be working if we didn't have downtime if each of us didn't  have the opportunity to go and get some time and some reflection then we wouldn't be able  
**[0:40:47-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:40:47):**  to push um so that is a super important piece but um yes the tools and approaches and fire  and changing the culture um cultural perception those are all such important pieces of this  um and and that also includes cattlemen and cattle women and just cattle people not being  
**[0:41:10-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:41:10):**  allergic to goats and goat grazing right for my cattle for my cattle friends out there  why don't you go take a look at the market and what are goats bringing that's what i'm  telling them i say they're making the money you're just i'm just saying oh how how bad  
**[0:41:28-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:41:28):**  what's our what's our gestation period you know it's like how fast can i'm just saying  i don't hear 100 ground up goat meat is like i don't know i 16 to 20 bucks a pound it's  what i usually see it for um and you know then there's something else like that the  
**[0:41:44-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:41:44):**  hides aren't the hides some of the hides worth something goat hides sheep eyes  uh sheep hides yeah well okay the sheep industry the whole other thing right now the market's  pretty great uh for sheep it is probably the sheep industry is like one of the most volatile  
**[0:42:03-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:42:03):**  industries to be in you mean like leather not like wool right or hair what are we talking  about we're talking about like value add oh like what what value there is for sheep for  sheep and goat hides yeah yeah uh well i'm in the business of sheep hides i also okay  
**[0:42:23-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:42:23):**  um my other business is called shepherdess holistic hides and we use a byproduct from  the commercial you know meat uh yeah conventional meat processing byproduct of a whole bunch  of sheep hides and they are often bailed and shipped off to china or in because of political  
**[0:42:49-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:42:49):**  things over the last several years the value the market for sheep hides the salted skins  have gone just it's just dropped and so unfortunately there's been a lot of what do we do with these  things we have to incinerate them or compost them and but they're absolutely beautiful  
**[0:43:08-0:43:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:43:08):**  things to have in the home everybody loves a sheep skin you mean it's timeless humanity  has evolved with the skins of animals so right i'm i'm finding that my sheep hide business  is i mean that's what's carried me to even start my grazing business is a value-added  
**[0:43:27-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:43:27):**  product from the sheep and goat industry um so thank you sheep i mean i'm selling sheep  hides more than a sheep on hoof and uh and i'm not buying the sheep hide salted for you  know fraction of a cost so um yeah they're very valuable that we have a lot of processing  
**[0:43:50-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:43:50):**  challenges just like in the meat industry and their processing opportunities they're  slim you know our niche meat processing is very limited and so is our tanning uh and  ecologically sound tanning and a lot of tanning is from you know goes overseas where there's  
**[0:44:11-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:44:11):**  not environmental regulation or public safety regulation that at a lower cost of labor yes  lower cost of labor i think we all need to just get prepared that every we're going to  be paying more money for everything that's just if we need to look at true value of things  
**[0:44:29-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:44:29):**  we need to really start looking at quality of what we buy not quantity of what we buy  and look at like where where did this stuff come from you know what is it going to do  when we not when we don't use it anymore uh and i like my shepides because i know that  
**[0:44:48-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:44:48):**  someday it's just gonna go back into the earth and and do what you know a dead animal would  do in nature it it's just gonna it's it's just gonna you know do the thing and i think  that looking at not just the food system but the fiber system is going to be equally if  
**[0:45:08-0:45:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:45:08):**  not more important um because the apparel industry has been traditionally one of the  most wasteful and resource intensive you know industries in the world and it's there's a  big push for that to change and when you throw in modern synthetic fabrics that are made  
**[0:45:27-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:45:27):**  with petroleum products it makes it even worse that are in wales it's just yeah i don't want  to go down that whole thing i just actually want to talk about how awesome goats are okay  but um you know okay i did want to say i did want to say to the audience who do run cattle  
**[0:45:48-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:45:48):**  who do have an allergy towards goats um there are opportunities for grants for cost share  of using prescribed grazing to address invasive species encroachment on your property that  is through usda programs through the nrcs called the conservation stewardship program  
**[0:46:11-0:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:46:11):**  and and i believe the equip program that i think it's more of a conservation stewardship  program but they have listed prescribed grazing uh as a uh tool or approach that they will  support in a cost share because they recognize the efficacy of prescriptive grazing to reduce  
**[0:46:33-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:46:33):**  and manage encroachment of invasive species which is absolutely necessary if we're going  to talk about supporting the integrity of uh resilience in our ecologies and our range  and our operations so cattle folks you can get money to hire us grazers and i did want  
**[0:46:53-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:46:53):**  to make a correction brian that i think the cattle grazers are going to want us to go  in places that are hard to go and i'm not i'm not hungry enough to pay them for me to  do some really intensive labor because we have to set up fences or we have to do day  
**[0:47:08-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:47:08):**  circuits grazing that you know every single day of the year shepherd is being paid we're  not like we're gonna round up twice you know twice a season or whatever i don't know i  mean i know my cattle folks hats off to sam ryerson and ariel greenwood in montana i  
**[0:47:27-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:47:27):**  just went to visit and holy heck they they interact every single day with their cattle  but i do know operations where they let the cattle out and they're gone for a long time  they don't see their cattle for months once a year right yeah columbus style management  
**[0:47:43-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:47:43):**  you turn them loose then go discover them six months later yeah right and see how close  they get i'm okay this is a secret to everybody i'm getting it's it's not going to be a secret  for long if you say it on this podcast i know this is uh this is my client do you want to  
**[0:48:02-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:48:02):**  hear in on on this conversation can i can i pick it up yeah we can always edit out later  okay hey jesse i'm actually uh funny enough i'm on a podcast right now um so i'm not cooking  you any goat meat for lunch that's for sure yeah i just want to make sure the sheep and  
**[0:48:23-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:48:23):**  goats are in okay cool i look forward to catching up i'm excited to hear what we came up with  for the planting plan all right sweet talk to you soon it's so great when you're buddies  with your clients you know we're working on this vernal pool restoration and this post  
**[0:48:45-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:48:45):**  fire uh yeah grazing and and that's my the the grounds manager of the property is my  partner in it because he's going to be the one who's maintaining the the plantings after  we go but we're intensively grazing fertilizing planting and then we're going to come back  
**[0:49:03-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:49:03):**  successively every year um so that's what that call was about he wanted to follow up  on on our conversations and that we had about planting um so thank you  oh that's fine i mean it's kind of relevant content and you know i think we we can all  
**[0:49:22-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:49:22):**  understand what it's like to get those phone calls at you know that phone call can come  at any time of day cows on highway your sheep are in the garden you know it's it's just  one of those things we've got to deal with and thanks for sharing that a little bit with  
**[0:49:37-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:49:37):**  us oh yeah absolutely i mean it's real so the the thing i have to say about folks who  are either interested in prescribed grazing or grazing in more public areas um it's going  to be really important to have somebody on your team or for you to personally develop  
**[0:50:01-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:50:01):**  patient communication skills and recognize that it is absolutely imperative to find humanity  in every single person you interact with and try to find patients and just recognize your  job is going to go so much easier if you find a way to effectively communicate and hold  
**[0:50:24-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:50:24):**  your cool when you are so frustrated um because folks just don't really know a lot of the  things that are that are going on you know it's like where those animals don't have water  and it's like actually go look see that tank and see that hose yeah i just i just heard  
**[0:50:45-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:50:45):**  a story of that by my comrade grazer michael light of spinter brush goats he gets these  calls like your guard dog there's dead dogs in your paddock and it's like you know guard  dogs they work all night and then they sleep all day and they sleep on the job and that's  
**[0:50:58-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:50:58):**  just what they do it's like you know clap your hands five feet next to them and wake  up and we'll be like what's up you know uh or like neighbors i have a neighbor in my  home base she complains about guard dogs barking and i say they're doing their job but i will  
**[0:51:18-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:51:18):**  move them and the animals a little bit further away although we live in the valley so you  know everything everything travels and sound effects yeah yeah and and i and i totally  i sympathize with her i'm like oh i'm seriously i just can't function when i don't sleep so  
**[0:51:38-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:51:38):**  i i told you i'm gonna i'm gonna do my best to to ensure that the dogs aren't barking  all night for no reason but then i also have to say but they are doing a job and the one  time that after many nights of her not you know being upset about the dog barking i clip  
**[0:51:58-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:51:58):**  up the dogs and what happens we have our first kill we have our first coyote killed and i  told her i'm like i can't do this this is zoned rural ag i know you moved to from la  so you could live in the country and have peace and quiet but this is an agricultural  
**[0:52:16-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:52:16):**  yeah you know there are country noises in the country yeah honestly though i mean i've  had i've worn earplugs at night sometimes when you know harvest is going on and there's  you're weaning and there's falling calves like i've totally done that like i i get that  
**[0:52:32-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:52:32):**  but there's other solutions than just saying i can't stand the dogs barking you can get  your gloves you can it's soundproof your room i don't know yeah i worry you know it's management  i can move yeah our home base uh our sacrificial paddock uh are with a hard fence is very close  
**[0:52:52-0:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:52:52):**  to you know close to the property line in retrospect we got to think about design to  mitigate bf like neighbor complaints so what do i do i move i try to move the dogs and  the animals but then i get donkey thinking okay the donkeys aren't going to bark well  
**[0:53:09-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:53:09):**  then i get a text like i just picked up a dog another donkey on monday i get a text  on tuesday saying your donkeys are fog horns in the at two in the morning you need to move  your donkeys i'm like i got the donkeys so the dogs wouldn't bark i don't know what to  
**[0:53:27-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:53:27):**  tell you lady i'm sorry uh but the donkeys are going to stay because they are my emotional  support animals if anything that is the most important thing if the boss has been happy  and doesn't get her donkey time then everything goes out the window but anyways you know i  
**[0:53:43-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:53:43):**  but i'm trying i try to be patient with her recognizing my neighbor and we got to you  know that going back to that that sentiment of nature natural disasters watersheds you  know habitats they don't care the disconnect right oh yeah no they don't care about property  
**[0:54:04-0:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:54:04):**  lines so i have to manage as if the whole valley is a part of my context and her and  it also includes the human factor and we need to find some sort of cohesion so more can  get done if if we are in good times with our neighbors you know and that's hard but we  
**[0:54:27-0:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:54:27):**  need to do that that's just crucial yeah i i just want to repeat to some of our listeners  is is it's it's okay that there's conflict but i love what you did is like hey i hear  you i validate that you're not sleeping and that sucks not sleeping however they are doing  
**[0:54:49-0:55:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:54:49):**  their job in the next y and z right so it's like that's that's one way i think i've learned  that works with anyone who's grumpy and in wanting to put on that customer support hat  you know and being more patient with people it's like hey i hear you i get that you're  
**[0:55:06-0:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:55:06):**  dealing with other things and this is the last thing you want to do is have an issue  but it is blah blah blah you know it's always just like you have to almost like just kind  of repeat back what they just said to you and like yes yeah yes nonviolent communication  
**[0:55:22-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:55:22):**  skills yeah you know we do have to we do have to validate you know and we have to you know  what when i start getting frustrated i have i'm really trying hard to think about what  is the outcome that i want and how do i have to behave to get closer to the outcome i want  
**[0:55:42-0:56:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:55:42):**  right because if i react that's sometimes putting fuel on the fire and most likely they're  not going to want to you know play nice with me if i am you know yeah being defensive or  whatever it may be and and i think that i think that is comes down to you know just  
**[0:56:05-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:56:05):**  sound stockmanship you know if i if i want my animals to be moving gracefully then i  have to be moving gracefully right if i want them to load you know if i want them to behave  i have to behave whatever behaving is like go goats are another story um but uh good  
**[0:56:26-0:56:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:56:26):**  thing i'm like a goat um because i get where they're coming from so yeah i really love  that we kind of came to a place of the social dynamics and how how important it is to address  the how how important the social piece is because we absolutely need it in a changing  
**[0:56:51-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:56:51):**  world especially in agriculture with succession like family succession and looking at the  next generation of who's coming into agriculture it might be non-traditional folks how do we  communicate when we are different you know these are all really important questions that  
**[0:57:05-0:57:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:57:05):**  we need to be a part of answering  i want to talk about your hide business so what are you doing with with your hides i  think i think i know the answer because i've seen some of your work you you make some pretty  
**[0:57:23-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:57:23):**  beautiful i think christine had a bag that you made for her oh yeah um so i have the  sheep hide business and we tan salted hides hair on hides we call them heads wool and  we get them tanned we work with three different tanneries around the west and then we sell  
**[0:57:46-0:58:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:57:46):**  them as full hides like beautiful people use them for interiors and put babies on them  use them as rugs put them on a car seat whatever i can use a pair of chinks yeah you could  do that i'm actually working on a new project making a salad packet um really yeah yeah  
**[0:58:06-0:58:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:58:06):**  so we're working to have traceability and where the hides come from yeah and working  with producers that are climate beneficial certified through the fiber shed um non-profit  and climate beneficial is essentially working with producers that practice carbon farming  
**[0:58:27-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:58:27):**  practices right um so i have the whole hives i also have value-added products like this  cheap the saddle pad um i've done a line of uh of um beautiful pillows that are filled  with wool um people love the shooting pillows they're like i hope i mean sheepskins kind  
**[0:58:50-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:58:50):**  of are trending forever because we've evolved with them but one of the the reasons why i  got into the sheep hides is because i'm a leather worker and i love to work my gams  there's just like they're my hands are my favorite part of my body and my hands just  
**[0:59:10-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:59:10):**  when they are working i become in a flow state and i love working with leather and that is  kind of what brought me to sheepskins of wanting to work with uh animal hide that i have some  sort of connection to and um my leather work i do right now is very minimal and very in  
**[0:59:34-0:59:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:59:34):**  custom you know one-off things people hit me up to make something and um i'll do it  and christine sue i absolutely was going to make her something and i sourced the um i  sourced the leather not not wool but leather from white oak pastures and that made me really  
**[0:59:58-1:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=0:59:58):**  happy yeah yeah yeah yeah so i i love that yeah yeah i sourced their leather to kimberlin  right like you need to get a contract with tibbelly yeah they just started a regenerative  leather line and i think that more and more brands are getting sick yes not just fiber  
**[1:00:17-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:00:17):**  but leather is a big part um i sit on a committee called the regional fiber manufacturing initiative  through the fiber shed program and i'm contributing uh and advising on how do we help revolutionize  our uh fiber system but on the hives and leather end and a lot of our hold up is processing  
**[1:00:41-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:00:41):**  and how do we support more tanneries and what are our limitations there how do we move hides  around how do we get processors to get the finished hide that can be tanned how do we  they essentially need just have they need to salt them they need to dry them salt them  
**[1:00:59-1:01:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:00:59):**  you know it's really hard to get processors to do that like you want to keep your hide  where are we going to put it like you got to come pick it up right now and then you're  stuck with salting it and then you have to figure out how to get it there and by the  
**[1:01:09-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:01:09):**  end you've paid hundreds of dollars for shipping and hundreds of hours to figure out how to  get one hide it's just like people think it's really cool to do as producers but but it's  very hard to do and so my business you know shepherd is holistic hides i'm seeing a moment  
**[1:01:29-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:01:29):**  in time where i can help advise how to stitch together the whole production system you know  we have to start at the processor we're gonna have to get the processor yeah to integrate  technologies that will support the hide getting finished uh are readied for tanning and that  
**[1:01:50-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:01:50):**  in itself can be its own whole business or enterprise because you can you can charge  you can charge for for that service you know not ridiculous amounts but there's an if we  really do want to look at traceable or regenerative whatever we have to be able to have the whole  
**[1:02:12-1:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:02:12):**  process follow the light the story the the lifetime of where this thing comes from to  where it gets to to then buy it  you know the lack of processing it's that seems to be a constantly reoccurring theme  
**[1:02:33-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:02:33):**  whether we're talking about sheep goats hides or cattle um you know or even leather like  you know it's hard to find a tannery there's very few tanneries left in the united states  though brian like is it now that we're talking about what we talked about the beginning of  
**[1:02:49-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:02:49):**  this episode is is because people don't want to work in a processing facility or is it  because it's been so centralized that i think it's because it's been so centralized and i  think that there's a part of it that you know it's not a clean process necessarily um you  
**[1:03:11-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:03:11):**  know does require some fairly ugly chemicals to do it at scale or it requires a lot of  labor to do it um you know to do a a clean tanning process like a brain tanning process  of course you need the brain and i think some of the you need the brain at least and the  
**[1:03:30-1:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:03:30):**  hide and that takes you know that's a labor-intensive process so you know it all the all the chemicals  make it quicker to process right takes less labor they can do more at a time but then  those chemicals have their own environmental problems right it's just like using fertilizer  
**[1:03:52-1:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:03:52):**  right yeah so it's so it's a catch-22 you know we're using a lot of these synthetics  where you know there's a natural solution it just requires more human labor to get there  and you know then the problem becomes okay well we everybody needs a living wage well  
**[1:04:11-1:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:04:11):**  what does that really mean you know if the producers of food and the producers of fiber  and of leather don't get them don't get a living wage uh they're gonna quit doing it  right and and then what happens you know the answer is not going to be importing more of  
**[1:04:28-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:04:28):**  it from china so there's we're at a strange intersection in history like i mean there  there's a lot of things happening right now and a lot of things are changing at literally  breakneck speed and you know i was just looking at the schedule it's going to be probably  
**[1:04:47-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:04:47):**  about 10 days before we release this and the world could be a completely different place  in 10 days you know the last 18 months have definitely showed us all that so you know  how do we square the needs you know the future needs of of fiber and protein and land ecology  
**[1:05:08-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:05:08):**  with quote a living wage how does that all square and i i don't have an answer i really  don't i wish i did  well i think you brought both of you brought up really good points pk you know you asked  
**[1:05:26-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:05:26):**  about you know you challenged is it is it that we don't want that there aren't people  who want to be in on kilflor you know that that's a that's a good question uh i think  there that applies to do people want to live in a sheep camp 24 7 365 and not see their  
**[1:05:49-1:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:05:49):**  families for three to five years on an hba okay i don't think domestic labor or like  folks here want to do it uh so what do we do we have to change the job description to  work for what our new context is socially and we have to look at ways that if we can't  
**[1:06:12-1:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:06:12):**  afford to pay double overtime then what are the other values exchanges that can be provided  to incentivize somebody to do this type of work and for me the way i am doing it with  the awesome team i have is called a swing shepherd we have a swing shift shepherd program  
**[1:06:34-1:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:06:34):**  the shepherds are not full time the shepherds come in on two three or four day swing shifts  and they kind of just bounce off one another and they get to go away and go and surf or  go and go to the city where one of my my uh shout out to dylan boiken he's my head shepherd  
**[1:06:56-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:06:56):**  and he lives in los angeles when he's not in the sheep camp you know it's like people  need to go home and take a shower refresh go and do life and then come back and they're  they're ready to roll i would say by day gosh day seven in the sheep camp for me i don't  
**[1:07:14-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:07:14):**  have a long tolerance anymore but by day seven in a sheep camp like you get the shepherd  blues and everything changes you're in like a totally different time continuum and going  back into society doesn't work the old the old school shepherds were usually kind of  
**[1:07:30-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:07:30):**  the the solo flying uh folks in society that didn't fit into the main the you know the  main community dynamics and i'm trying to challenge that with the swing shepherd idea  where it's like if if the model of the traditional shepherd does not work anymore then let's  
**[1:07:52-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:07:52):**  change the job description to work and that means i have to change my business model to  make it work because if you don't have labor then you don't have a business so again this  is a part of this developing a new model testing it i'm sure there's a lot of people saying  
**[1:08:11-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:08:11):**  well that's not going to work for me well i'm well not good but like i hear you then  design something that will allow for a new way a new job description to be designed to  keep people there and i promise you sheep and goat producers out there looking for shepherds  
**[1:08:31-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:08:31):**  i'm going to do my darndest to help train them and and create some sort of throughput  for folks to come to you and i will make sure that they know the difference between a sheep  and a goat before they get to you and that's and that's what you're trying to do with the  
**[1:08:46-1:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:08:46):**  grazing school of the west right yes absolutely absolutely and and and it's it's an interesting  dynamic now that i have a working business and i also have a training program that i've  developed with olivia tinconny through the fiber support of the fiber shed organization  
**[1:09:04-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:09:04):**  again um shout out to fiber shed and uh no gretz initiative for all the support over  the years it's been a long project tons of interest and so many people come to the website  fill out the newsletter and come back you know four months later saying what's new how  
**[1:09:21-1:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:09:21):**  do i get in and i'm like i'm working on it i promise but the way the only way i see this  thing working is that there needs to be an opportunity for a working apprenticeship and  the way to ready shepherds to go into different contexts of uh outfits like got my buddy's  
**[1:09:43-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:09:43):**  chaos sheep outfit up in the north and they do tons of grazing and vineyards and orchards  they do fire grazing as well they're one of the largest scale operators in the state their  operation is very different than my two 300 head operation then you have um you have big  
**[1:10:02-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:10:02):**  you know big range operations like paisinas ranch uh you have koyama lamb that is uh running  animals in santa barbara and they do fire grazing but they're also producing woolen  lamb i think that a training shepherd needs to go to all of these dynamics why don't we  
**[1:10:21-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:10:21):**  throw some training shepherds out in the middle of nowhere too you know and and see really  i think people really need a taste of all of the different things instead of being like  i'm gonna go to shepherdess land and livestock they look really cute in the bucolic fields  
**[1:10:37-1:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:10:37):**  of ohai it's like well no it's not always cute and really to know this and to learn  that you need to go to other operations and and that's how you really learn holistic context  though right it's being adaptive yes yes yes and not one one size does not fit all and  
**[1:10:58-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:10:58):**  i think that not just trainees on the ground need happen but uh employees and employers  employers need and mentors need training as well and i think that's why the new agrarian  apprenticeship program uh cloveras apprenticeship program is so awesome because it really supports  
**[1:11:16-1:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:11:16):**  mentors um producers as mentors for this next generation of agrarians and i think that this  model is going to be absolutely key to readying a new generation of land stewards on the land  in agriculture period that's amazing so i want i want to respect your time um while  
**[1:11:41-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:11:41):**  we wrap up is there anything that that we want that you wanted us to talk to talk about  that we didn't bring up oh gosh well let's see yes one of the things that i heard you  ask in an interview with sarah bangert was who were do you have mentors or folks that  
**[1:12:08-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:12:08):**  have inspired you or have supported you along the way and i appreciated that question because  i think that it is absolutely key to recognize that we cannot do this in a silo if we are  going to change models we need to do it in unison could you explain that the silo term  
**[1:12:33-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:12:33):**  because i think that's a relatively new term for some some of our listeners what you mean  by that a silo well you know i'll tell you my context because i don't know actually where  it came from um a silo uh we can't be in an echo chamber alone in the dark trying to figure  
**[1:12:57-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:12:57):**  things out we can't just rely on our partners or family members we have to have a larger  community it is absolutely key i am i am doing something absolutely nuts here in southern  california and i've been working my butt off to do it and it is only because of the community  
**[1:13:17-1:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:13:17):**  that has supported me to get here that i'm here so i think that it's absolutely crucial  and key for me to share in this little moment of soapbox that i myself and others who are  embarking on wild journeys and grazing and on the land with animals you have to have  
**[1:13:41-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:13:41):**  your community and hold them close because they need you just as much as you need them  and i want to shout out to all of my dear dear friends who've supported me along the  way and gals of women and ranching and all of the awesome organizations like the no regrets  
**[1:14:01-1:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:14:01):**  initiative fiber shed uh beth robinette with the new cowgirl camp uh yeah amy and jeremiah  square mile ranch uh grassman nomads ariel and sam um gosh aaron christine sue uh and  there's like so many i just without my community i wouldn't be here oh yeah guido frostini  
**[1:14:26-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:14:26):**  who was my my my shepherd playmate out in spain and france and then all of my mentors  and educators too um take the village yeah it really does take a village so i think that's  the last thing i wanted to share is that yeah you are not alone in this if you've been in  
**[1:14:46-1:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:14:46):**  it for a long time or you're just getting started or you want to start be humble and  and ask questions and bug us who people who are really busy like i really appreciate people  who are incessant in keeping asking me over and over again like i'm interested in this  
**[1:15:06-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:15:06):**  like can i help in this and you know persistence actually it can be annoying but it also is  like i take people really seriously when they really have to yes absolutely i'm hard to  track down and it's not because i don't care it's just because i am wearing five million  
**[1:15:23-1:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:15:23):**  hats and managing a lot and so um you know to your listeners maybe just like try to wait  like five minutes after you hear this but i do invite you to reach out get onto um my  business newsletter or grazing school the west newsletter or or uh what else uh i mean  
**[1:15:51-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:15:51):**  i got i guess i got a lot of ways to get it holding me i'll make sure we put all that  in the show notes ready yeah yeah yeah i got all the handles and all the things um reach  out and um i'm i'm really really looking forward to offering more resources for folks to get  
**[1:16:08-1:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:16:08):**  into this and in fact i'm going to do a shout out and anyone who's looking to collaborate  and put time into helping me in that endeavor i would be thrilled to collaborate with someone  to help um make uh these resources more readily available most likely social media um i i  
**[1:16:30-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:16:30):**  could use some help in that realm so um i'm open to that and always open to collaboration  and um thank you so much this has been awesome you two are doing such great work and i love  this podcast well thank you thank you for that yeah keeps us going to hear that yeah  
**[1:16:52-1:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:16:52):**  well it's it's important and i and i really i really look forward to seeing how i can  integrate pasture map into the industry of contract grazing because the tools are so  crucial we need the technologies to help us do our jobs efficiently effectively communication  
**[1:17:10-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:17:10):**  is key if we can use these tools um to make our lives easier but also to improve the ways  we can make cash money doing it absolutely even nonprofits need money guys just throw  yeah oh yeah i mean i hate to say it but my altruism from like i'm just gonna walk around  
**[1:17:32-1:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:17:32):**  with a whole bunch of sheep and goats and just like gorilla graze is like i don't need  much sleep it was like no no no no that's not me anymore i am thinking about bottom  line and i'm also thinking about quality of life right team but yeah we gotta make money  
**[1:17:46-1:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:17:46):**  guys that's not profitable nobody will do it yeah and return on investment is not just  cash we need it but there's a lot of different returns and the more we can capture what those  other returns are ecologically socially spiritually physically and then we're really looking at  
**[1:18:10-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:18:10):**  the whole awesome awesome i think that's a great place to go ahead and end it today i  think so too y'all well i'm out uh going to go tend to a sheep that got bit in the face  by a rattlesnake yesterday oh fun yeah well i found the range well behind houses it's  
**[1:18:34-1:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/28-Brittany-Cole-Bush-Models-Change-in-Unison-e16kh4k#t=1:18:34):**  always something isn't it oh yeah oh yeah yeah well thanks guys have a really wonderful  uh weekend and um thanks listeners thank you cole thank you have a great day bye y'all

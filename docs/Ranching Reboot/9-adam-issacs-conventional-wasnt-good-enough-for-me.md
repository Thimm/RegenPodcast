**[0:01:10-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:10):**  We're going to have a great conversation today about Corrientes and regenerative grazing  and economics.  And as a special bonus, we're going to focus quite a bit on drones and how he uses drones.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:22):**  I even get a little bit on how I use drones in my operation and what that could possibly  look like for an enterprise in the future.  So with that in mind, I want you guys to watch out.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:35):**  I've got a special bonus in mind.  I'm going to try to get out for you this Thursday.  So watch out for that special bonus episode.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:42):**  It should be coming out here in just a few days.  That being said, here's my buddy and my co-pilot CK to introduce today's guest.  Thank you, Brian.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:52):**  Today we've got Adam Isaacs with Need More Ranching.  Adam, how are you doing today?  I'm good.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:01:57):**  How are you all?  Doing great, buddy.  Doing great.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:01):**  It's good to see you.  It's good to catch up.  So really the first thing that's on my mind is what you're kind of most famous for lately  
**[0:02:09-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:09):**  is that New York Times article.  Yeah, it was a treat.  It was cool to get to show people what we do, especially New Yorkers and folks that  
**[0:02:19-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:19):**  have no idea what agriculture even looks like and where their food comes from.  We've gotten lots of great feedback.  I talked to a gentleman in Somaliland on the phone, to ex-professors in Washington, and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:33):**  it's opened some doors and it's been really cool.  It's been a neat opportunity.  Share some more of that feedback.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:39):**  I'm interested.  Like, is it from unexpected directions?  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:02:45-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:02:45):**  It was from people who just had general questions like wanting to get into agriculture and or  maybe they had a little bit, but they were young and just had basic questions.  I had people in the oil and gas industry saying, hey, my dad's got a place in the branches  
**[0:03:04-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:03:04):**  and I'm wanting to get into it, but I just really don't know how or what.  So folks like that, there's been more feedback than really we expected.  There's a lot of people too that reached that had no idea it would have reached ranchers  
**[0:03:23-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:03:23):**  in South Central Kansas that had no idea, read the New York Times and this is not talking  about you, Brian, but some other people is like, I would not have expected you to have  read that, but no, it's been good.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:03:35):**  Yeah, that actually came across my newsfeed.  I saw it so many times.  Before I saw it on Facebook, like I was scrolling my Google News and I saw that there before  
**[0:03:46-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:03:46):**  I saw it on Facebook, I'm like, hey, that's my buddy, Adam.  That's cool.  I think one of either Kentucky or Tennessee, a US House representative kind of retweeted  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:03:56):**  it.  And so it was even kind of getting to the political White House type stuff.  And so that was, I don't know, maybe the president saw it too.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:05):**  We hope Bill Gates and some of those other big names kind of saw that and made them kind  of question and think about what they're doing.  So did you see what Bill Gates, okay, are you going to say this?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:14):**  Go ahead.  Did you hear what he said about when someone asks, hey, Bill, why are you buying all this  land?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:21):**  What did he say?  Because we need to build better seeds.  And it has nothing to do with climate, right?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:29):**  Like, yeah, tell me that guy's not going to be in for a rude awakening in the next couple  of years, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:37):**  So.  He'll figure it out.  I hope Bill Gates sees your article, Adam, because he needs some alignment for sure.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:44):**  Yeah, for sure.  I agree.  Ah, so Need More Ranching.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:48):**  That's kind of an interesting name.  How'd you guys come up with that?  And who is Need More Ranching?  
**[0:04:53-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, so Need More Ranching is me and my wife, Aubrey.  We started I guess here with that name just probably last year, but our main base, our  biggest lease is on Need More Creek Ranch, which is located on Need More Creek and the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:05:11):**  US Cavalry back in the 1800s had a outpost on it where they could, you know, a general  supply store where they could buy supplies and get mail and a few things like that back  in the Indian Wars, but they always needed more stuff there.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:05:26):**  So they called it Need More Creek.  And so that's kind of the history of the ranch.  So we've kind of expanded on that and decided to start to need more ranching.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:05:37):**  And you're on leased land, correct?  Yes, everything we've got is leased.  I mean, there's some family land and then other stuff that's non-family, but everything  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:05:45):**  is leased.  Okay, so let's back up a little bit.  So tell us about yourself, your story about, you know, where you're at in life and how  
**[0:05:54-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:05:54):**  you got there and how you got to be in agriculture.  Oh, okay.  So I grew up in a very conventional and traditional ranching operation.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:06):**  I really, we had somebody doing all the day to day stuff.  And so I wasn't out checking the heifers or doing that type of thing.  I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do in high school as a career.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:19):**  Looking back now when I was a five year old, you know, you had to like, draw out, hey,  this is what I want to be when I grow up.  And apparently I wrote in there that I wanted to attend Texas Tech University and be a rancher.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:31):**  And high school, Adam did not know that.  So I went off to Montana State University and was studying ranch management, but figured  out that I was learning a lot about grizzlies and elk and mountains and stuff.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:43):**  Almost like biology.  Yeah, I wasn't gonna be able to apply a lot of that.  I enjoyed it.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:49):**  It was a lot of fun.  And there's so many things you could do up there, but I wasn't gonna be able to apply  it to kind of my ecosystem and those types of things.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:06:55):**  And I was a little homesick.  So I decided to transfer to Texas Tech University, little five year old Adam knew that's where  I was going to end up.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:02):**  And so that's where I ended up, got a degree in ranch management.  And you know, I learned, I think it instilled a passion is what college did.  I didn't necessarily learn any of the things that I'm doing right now at college, but I  
**[0:07:16-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:16):**  think it kind of instilled a passion for ranch, range improvements, or any ranch related stuff.  And so that's where the journey started out of college, I went and worked for the Natural  Resources Conservation Service.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:30):**  I was a range land management specialist for them for a few years.  And that just I learned a lot.  And it was good to get to work with ranchers.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:39):**  But it was a lot of contract stuff.  And I got into this field in this degree for a reason.  And that was just, you know, be outside and do the ecology and I got to do a little bit  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:48):**  of that.  But I spent more time on the computer than I liked.  And so I knew I needed to change something.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:07:54):**  So the opportunity to came up that we could move back and lease the ranch and start doing  our own deal.  And so that's where we're at now.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:02):**  We've got custom grazing, we own some of our own cows.  We you know, we did yearlings last year custom grazing, we've got custom pairs right now.  We're just kind of trying to try out all these different enterprises, see what works and  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:15):**  expand from there.  Well, that's great.  So you mentioned you're down on Needmore Creek.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:23):**  Where Where is that?  What kind of where are you at in the world?  Yeah, so we're in Canadian, Texas, that is in the northeast corner of the Texas Panhandle.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:33):**  We're on the Canadian River runs from New Mexico up kind of by Angel Fire, New Mexico,  if you've been ever been there all the way through Oklahoma City, and then on east.  Right.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:45):**  So you said you moved back?  Are you originally from Canadian?  Yes.  
**[0:08:50-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:08:50):**  Yeah, I grew up on this ranch in Canadian and I'm living in the house that I actually  grew up in.  So that's kind of a was a little weird at first, but now I really don't think about  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:00):**  it anymore.  Funny story.  I'm living in the house I grew up in as well.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:07):**  And it's strange remodeling it and going in doing stuff and, you know, seeing dad's name  written on a stud or in a breaker box, you know, quality installation by Ted A in 1977.  Like, oh, yeah, and here's, here's his handwritten note about where all the breakers are.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:23):**  So that's kind of interesting.  And then you find something else that makes you go, well, who decided to do it that way?  Yep, we've been running across the same things, but you get used to it.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:36):**  And becomes your home and you don't really second guess it after that.  So let's talk about the cows, not the custom grazers.  Let's talk about your cows.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:45):**  And what kind of cows do you have?  And why do you like them?  So I knew you'd come up with this question, Brian, because we kind of have the same type  
**[0:09:52-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:09:52):**  of cows.  So I, I, our primary herd is Corianis.  I started out with, I bought some red Angus and tried that and it just didn't really work  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:02):**  for me.  And then I found some registered red Angus and thought, well, maybe this will work for  me.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:07):**  And we tried that and it didn't really work.  And so I kind of started to learn a little bit about the undervalued and maybe the underappreciated.  And I think Corianis or both of that, they're becoming less undervalued.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:21):**  I think people are starting to pick up on them and see the value in them and the genetics  that they can provide.  And one of our big goals here on this ranch is kind of some range improvement and improving  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:32):**  the land.  It's kind of been abused.  And the best tool for the job is probably going to be the hardiest cow we can find.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:39):**  And so best bang for the buck that we have found, that's able to be found somewhat locally  has been the Corianis cows.  So we're, we're not breeding back with any Corianis bulls, we're breeding with, with  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:50):**  Angus type genetics, high meat to bone ratio, not anything large growth or anything like  that.  We're still kind of shooting for maternal, but that's where we're at right now.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to ask what your gen two plan is because, you know, I know  that I know we're kind of about in the same place and we don't want to give anything,  give too much away too early.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:11:10):**  Right, right.  But it's, it's cool to see.  It's always exciting to see, see the progeny that are coming out and replacements and  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:11:19):**  Do they feel like F1 crosses though?  Can we talk about that?  Like, is that kind of the idea?

**[0:11:31-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:11:31):**  I just sold kind of my first set here a few weeks ago of F1 crosses and they did really,  really well.  We were very pleased.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:11:42):**  So far it's worked and you'll, you'll have your cows that fall out and those that just  even with a good genetic bull trying to add meat to them, just they don't end up turning  out that great.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:11:53):**  But I think you're going to get that in every breed.  We can't blanket statement that the Cori any cow is going to fix all and they're all great  because that is not true.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:12:02):**  There's a set of 30 something out here that were open and I'm trying to re-breed and sell  right now because they're falling out.  But for both of you, what was the driving motivator?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:12:10):**  Was it to fit the, the environment that they, they needed to perform in?  That's what it was for me.  You know, they, they, they need to be able to perform in the environment with minimum  
**[0:12:23-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:12:23):**  supplementation and the more I started thinking about, you know, what breeds of cattle are  available in North America that have genetically adapted to live on this forage, you know,  and the more I learned about the conventional production side and you know, a lot of the  
**[0:12:41-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:12:41):**  high inputs that guys were putting into their, you know, these big 12, 14, 1600 pound cows.  I knew that was never going to be economical, especially when your entry price point was  over $2,000 for a cow.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:12:53):**  You know, I knew I had to, I knew that if I was ever going to build a cow herd, I had  to find something that was, that was represented a much larger value.  And at the same time also found something that was small frame, forage efficient, very  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:13:09):**  fertile and didn't need a whole lot of supplement to live on.  And that's, you know, that's what we all want, right?  That's the Holy grail.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:13:17):**  But the only problem with Corianna is, is they're a little bit too small and they grow  just a little bit too slow.  For sure, for sure.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:13:24):**  And you know, I, I'm running one herd during breeding season.  So I've still got red Angus and some black Angus as well.  And I run everything together as one herd during the summer during the breeding season.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:13:37):**  But then in the winter, I'm changing that because these higher input cows aren't holding  up like at all.  I lose in body condition.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:13:48):**  I can't feed them more if they're all in one group.  And so that's, I'm pushing the Corianna cows a whole lot harder than I am the higher input  like Angus type cows and feeding them less and they're doing just as well.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:03):**  So that's really neat to see that.  I'm pushing the batch that I'm pushing mine pretty hard.  And I've got three different, three different groups.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:12):**  I got the group I bought out of Texas and a group I bought from a future guest, hopefully.  And another group I bought out of the Woodward sale barn.  And I can sure tell, I can sure tell the ones that are going to fit the program and the  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:27):**  ones that are succeeding and the ones that are not.  There's there's already a lot of fallout of the program this year, but you know, you just  have to accept that.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:34):**  And then when you buy a cow for 300 bucks, yeah, it's, I mean, it's $300 cow.  Yeah, for sure.  For sure.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:46):**  It's, and you know what, there's such a huge barrier to entry for people that are trying  to get into this deal.  And custom grazing is one of the easiest ways to get into that.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:14:55):**  But I was trying to bridge that gap and try to, what can I own that is not going to be  a huge barrier to entry that allows me to learn?  I think there's a lot better.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:15:10):**  I guess I would say it is anybody that I would advise that wants to get into the cow-calf  business that is in a an environment similar to ours, Brian, I would recommend go out and  buy some Cori any cows, I think you've got a lot more grace, there's a lot more wiggle  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:15:23):**  room for some mess ups.  And they're going to be okay.  They're just hardier, they hold up better.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:15:30):**  There's less initial investment in them.  It's been a really good tool for us, even though I grew up ranching and on it, you know,  on a ranch, when you're the one making all the day to day decisions, it changes things  
**[0:15:44-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:15:44):**  a lot.  And so having an animal that can hold up to that is definitely valuable.  I don't know if we should really be telling everybody this because then price is going  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:15:53):**  to go up and when we want to buy replacements, we're going to have to pay more for them.  But I guess it is what it is.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:01):**  For sure.  You're right on that, though.  I saw last week, they had a special sale $900 for pairs.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:07):**  So $300 cow, put a bull on them, get them bred, get a calf out of it and turn it around  and sell it for 900 bucks.  That'd be pretty hard to beat.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:16):**  That's very hard to beat.  I mean, that's good money.  And you can turn that pretty often.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:20):**  So that's a marketing trick.  So let's jump down a marketing rabbit trail.  You said you custom graze and you have some of your own cattle.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:31):**  Do you just sell at the barn or do you have a different pathway to market?  Facebook has been my biggest market.  I had a guy driving from Kansas City last weekend to buy some of the, I had some ropers,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:41):**  so some cows that I'd bought that were bred to a Coriini bull.  And so Facebook has been honestly my primary.  There's several groups, Coriini cattle, Coriini beef cross, a bunch of different groups.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:16:54):**  And I just kind of post a video there and it's great.  People drive to the ranch.  I don't have to haul anything.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:00):**  I don't have any tires blow out on the way to the sale barn.  I don't have to have a big diesel pickup to pull them.  I don't have to have a big expensive trailer to pull them.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:07):**  And there's demand for it.  I mean, I've had people drive from Eastern Oklahoma, Kansas City, New Mexico, you name  it.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:17):**  People are in demand, see the demand for it and there's not a lot of supply.  So it's been fairly easy to market them.  Well, that's good.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:26):**  That's good.  I didn't put a whole lot of thought in a marketing mind because I just didn't.  I'm sure I could have taken advantage of some other deals, but I had to make a decision  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:39):**  at the time.  So you mentioned you've been selling a lot through Facebook.  So before we get too much deeper down any rabbit trails, where can people find you on  
**[0:17:46-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:46):**  social media?  Yeah, so Need More Underscore Ranching is our Instagram handle.  My Facebook, I don't have one friend, I literally just created an account just so that I can  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:17:58):**  peruse around these groups and stuff.  You sound like my husband.  You really can't find me on Facebook.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:06):**  Quite frankly, I don't even know what my name is, or I don't know the last time I went to  my page or how to get to my page.  I simply use it as a marketing tool.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:14):**  Other than that, I'm not big on social media.  I probably should have a little bigger presence.  I've reserved a domain on Google, but I have yet to create a website.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:22):**  And that is on the to-do list at some point.  So unfortunately, it's a little bit hard to find me.  And some days I like that.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:30):**  I definitely understand that.  I like being hard to find.  So you talked about improving the land.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:41):**  So what are some of the metrics you're using to measure that?  We've got some transects set up.  I think photos are the best.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:18:49):**  It's easy to look at photos.  The hardest thing, and I think it's hard for a lot of ranchers, the majority of ranchers,  is taking the time to go out every year and taking photo transects.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:00):**  We can say we do it and we get it all set up.  But then you look back on it, it's like, man, I wish I had more photos.  And so I would like to do more of that.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:08):**  But we've got a few transects set up where we count what plants are at what marks on  the, I think about 100 meter tape is what we do.  We'll take a photo and the direction that we're pointing whenever we take those photos  
**[0:19:24-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:24):**  and implementing that.  I've got an app that I've been using for that.  And it has a timestamp with a GPS latitude and longitude on the photo.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:34):**  So that way you can go back.  I have found where if you go out and stick posts,  What was the name of that app?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:43):**  The name of the app, hold on, let me pull it up on my phone.  One thing that you do have to worry about is if you go stick a post out, and especially  if you're, you know, determining what plants are present, cows are going to go next to  
**[0:19:56-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:19:56):**  that post and rub on it and stomp on it and sleep around it and congregate on it.  And so they're changing and not it is your measure and not eat what's where the post  is.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:05):**  Right.  And so that's a real issue that you'll go back and see all the hair.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:12):**  So I had to, I had to learn from trial and error on that one.  But the app I use is called Grass Snap.  It's a University of Nebraska.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah pretty outdated.  I wish it was a little, I don't know, they would refresh it and maybe update it with  some stuff but it is free.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:29):**  And it's it's worked for so far.  Good deal.  So let's talk about how you graze.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:45):**  How do you graze down there on Needmore Creek?  We've, I would say we're in exploratory phase.  We do different, different things in different areas and we're experimenting.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:20:58):**  One thing that I'm learning through right now and I think you have too, we've gotten  a fair amount of moisture.  It's you know, mid to late March right now.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:21:07):**  And we've gotten a fair amount of moisture lately and I'm trying to learn, okay, is it  best to have them tighter and maybe pug up the ground a little bit but it's a smaller  sacrifice area or I give them a little bit bigger area.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:21:20):**  And maybe they don't affect it as bad but they're going to affect larger acres but we're  doing electric fencing.  There was no electric fencing out here when we got started.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:21:28):**  We we put it in some main permanent electric fence lines and then we're doing you know  poly wire off of that we're doing some strip grazing we're doing some ultra high density  grazing.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:21:39):**  We're doing just some lighter, more conventional grazing.  We're in the process of putting in water pipelines and so I have several pastures that are, oh,  I've got them down and now to four or 500 acres I think.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:21:54):**  I just don't have enough water in right now.  And so I make them smaller, right?  Yeah, I can't do what I want to do yet.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:02):**  But we're in the works because it pays.  I mean, it pays really well to move your cattle as much as possible and have them I think  as high density as possible.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:13):**  That's something I'm still learning through and where to do it.  You know, we'll experiment with we'll go over to a weedy patch and stomp it all in the ground  and then we'll go to super mature grasses and stomp it to the ground and see and you  
**[0:22:24-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:24):**  know how how nature responds.  Did you say how long you've been doing this?  Yeah, we've been doing this for  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:33):**  Oh, I guess the intensity has increased.  I mean, right.  Every every year.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:41):**  Learn something new.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:44-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:22:44):**  I'm high density grazing a year and a half now.  We we've got now the electric fence lifters that pens agro makes we imported those from  Argentina and have been experimenting with those and I know Brian, you've used the bat  
**[0:23:00-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:00):**  latches and I like this because it gives us the option to add a gate anywhere.  We don't have to have it right and and so wherever I've got poly wire running through  a big thick mature grass stand that the cows don't want to eat.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:12):**  I'll stick the lifter there and have them stomp it to the ground whenever they go through  to the next pasture.  And so I started chirping at pens agro on face on Instagram, saying, Hey, you know,

Why don't you send me a couple so you can compare into a bat latch?  Oh, they responded yet maybe we're calling them out again here.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:32):**  I guess we are calling them out again.  So pens agro gauntlet is thrown are those down?  Are those the ones Can you drive over those two or you just drive under them?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:43):**  Can you do any of that?  No, you could do what I'm talking about.  You could drive under Pablo.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:48):**  He's a really good guy.  Yeah, like Pablo.  So I don't know if you've seen American grazing land coalition is now selling these.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:23:57):**  And so you don't have to actually get them from Argentina, man, we had an order with  customs trying to import stuff.  And that was a disaster.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:04):**  And so they are going to be a lot easier, easier to access.  And so far, I would recommend it I seem to have got some custom cows right now that seemed  to be a little bit slow to learn.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:16):**  And so I've had to set up two of those gates next to each other to give them a larger area  and they seem to want to walk in.  But it seems like they don't want to walk under the gate if it's just one unless I drive  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:25):**  under it, which kind of defeats the purpose of yeah, I got to go out there and drive under  it from them.  Yeah, you might as well not have it if that's the case.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:33):**  So we'll see how quick they pick up on that.  I've only had them for not quite a month.  So  
**[0:24:38-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:38):**  you know, there's a training period.  There's always a training period with new cattle, especially when you're doing doing  something like a fence lifter or a bat latch.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:48):**  Some of them, some are smart, and they figure it out in two or three days.  Some are just kind of dumb and it takes a month.  What do they say?  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:24:56):**  It's 21 times to make a habit or to learn a new habit or whatever.  What is that saying?  I don't know.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:03):**  You think cows are the same way?  I think they're smarter than that.  I don't think it's...  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah, I thought you were going to say, I don't think they're the other way.  I think they program a lot quicker.  It's like the Pavlov theory, right?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:16):**  Like you know, you can train a dog to a sound and every time you have that sound, you feed  them and they salivate when they hear that sound because they, yeah.  Right.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:27):**  Yeah.  They are a lot smarter than people like to, you know, these cows I'm only going to have  for 90 days on my place and they never seen pollywye before when I got them.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:37):**  So that's been, you know, I'm learning through taking in cattle for three or four months  at a time and that's it, having to train them up.  I've got to get them trained as quick as I can so I can get them implemented into my  
**[0:25:47-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:47):**  system and not have them abuse these areas where I've got a semi loadout or, you know,  traps and things like that.  Yeah, and that's definitely understandable.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:25:58):**  You know, every time I get custom cattle in, I don't like to do things on a 90 day deal.  I like to, you know, if it's not 100, 120 days, I don't like to mess with it because  it does take 30 to 40 days to get everything settled in and, oh, you know, if you're on  
**[0:26:16-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:26:16):**  daily moves and you're out there every day and you're willing to, you know, put them  behind the wire, rebuild the fence and leave for a couple hours, three times a day, you  can, sometimes you can get them in, you know, three, four days.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:26:29):**  Sometimes you get a bunch that just get enough of them are familiar with it.  The rest don't mess with it.  And then sometimes you get a bunch of knuckleheads that all they do for a month on daily moves  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:26:39):**  is just tear your crap up.  And that's all you do is, you know, you're just a full time electric fence repair technician.  Yeah, I've got a question for you, Brian.  
**[0:26:48-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:26:48):**  If somebody said they'd send you 2000 head for three months, and then you can go to Costa  Rica for the other nine months, would you not entertain that?  You know, I've done it.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:00):**  I've done it.  Okay.  Yeah, I've done it.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:05):**  And I might do it again in the future.  But you know, it goes back to one of those things about having enterprises that are contextually  appropriate to your resource base.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:17):**  And I just don't think that running mass numbers of yearlings is really what my land needs  to succeed.  I have a feeling that my land is much more suited towards more of a year round cow calf  
**[0:27:29-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:29):**  production scheme and then peeling the peeling ones off, you want to finish and send them  somewhere else on a planted forage.  You don't want annual planted forage or under a pivot that's going to give them a lot more  
**[0:27:41-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:41):**  punch and they're going to have more of a consistent growth rate than they are on native  range.  Who said they needed to be yearlings?  
**[0:27:49-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:27:49):**  I know it is harder to find stuff, but these pairs that I got in are literally here for  90 days and then they're gone.  I wouldn't have any problem with doing cow calf or replacement heifers, you know, doing  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:01):**  a big number.  It's numbers.  It's all numbers.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:04):**  It's pounds of forage consumed, Adam.  It doesn't matter if it's a cow calf, heifer steer, or you're running somebody's 2000 pounds  on prize bulls.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:12):**  It's just hooves on the ground, pounds of forage consumed.  So tell me about some of your education in ranching.  Where did you go to learn what you know about ranching and what are you excited to keep  
**[0:28:28-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:28):**  learning about?  Well, this plug has been put in about 300 times in this podcast already and we're only  five episodes in.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:37):**  Oh no.  He's ready for this.  I think.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:40):**  It's a three letter word, RFP.  Ranching for a profit has been a very big role in our education.  It's been phenomenal.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:51):**  It's not going to give any more plug here.  The school that shall not be named.  The school that shall not be named.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:28:59):**  I know people have talked about it.  It's great.  If you haven't been, you need to go.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:02):**  I've been to some other stuff actually.  Well, Brian, you were at one school, what, last year with me, Wally Olson's marketing  school over in Oklahoma.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:11):**  That was really good.  It was eye opening.  It's a work in progress.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:17):**  I don't think it's something you're going to learn overnight.  For those that aren't familiar with that, if you've heard of Bud Williams, he not only  did stockmanship, but he also did sell by marketing.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:28):**  And so Wally Olson does that.  And it really teaches you, you know, before I knew what sell by marketing was, I had already  bought Cori and E-Cals, but that's what it is.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:37):**  I was buying the undervalued animal, adding value to it.  And then whenever it becomes overvalued, you sell it.  And I didn't know that's what I was doing, but it's what I was doing.  
**[0:29:48-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:29:48):**  And there's lots of different opportunities there.  I think the marketing is one thing that ranchers really needed to sharpen their tools on because  of marketing, we're not very good at as an industry.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:02):**  Are you doing anything to work on your marketing stream?  Do you have any plans to do direct to consumer sales, do any beef business sales, or are  you just strictly going to stay in the cattle business and not transition to the beef side?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:15):**  If I was to transition, I would not take on my own brand.  I would find somebody that's, you know, looking for some grass finished or grass fed animal  and wanting to take it from there.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:24):**  I don't, I've got another kind of side gig.  I do rain, I sell rainfall insurance.  And so with that and the ranching, I just don't have the time that I would like to allocate  
**[0:30:35-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:35):**  towards something like that.  And I don't see that I could justify bringing someone on, you know, just solely to work  for me.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:43):**  So I would need to find some form of a partnership if we were to want to do that at any scale.  And I think that's where a lot of us are is we're just tapped out labor wise and brain  power wise, and we just don't have anything left.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:30:57):**  But, you know, there's a lot of things that, you know, directions, we could all take our  business to be beneficial, not just for us, us, our families and our communities.  But the labor pool is not there.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:09):**  And it's not just the skill.  And it's not just the lack of skilled labor.  I mean, it's a lack of available labor, people that will just show up and work for a reasonable  
**[0:31:19-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:19):**  amount of money for the job you're doing.  It's going to become more of an issue to the past few weeks, I've called several, I just  bought a new UTV and was looking for a few accessories and things for it.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:30):**  And I was calling these companies, you know, saying, hey, what do you have in stock?  And one, they didn't have stuff in stock, and they'd have a two month lead time, but  two, they were literally offering me a job saying, hey, we need more people to work for  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:41):**  us because they can't find anybody to work right now.  I get it.  I mean, I get it quite a bit too.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:45):**  Yeah.  They're like, you're doing this.  You need to do this with us.  
**[0:31:49-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:31:49):**  It's been a serious issue.  So yeah, this this, hey, there are no jobs out there and our unemployment's getting bad.  That is by choice because there's plenty of places to work right now.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:01):**  It's just if somebody is willing to go do it.  Several of my friends have told me, oh, specifically a friend that owns an auto repair shop, and  he's been working on my feed trucks for the last year.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:14):**  And it's it's it's kind of a pain to get in there and get something worked on because  he's always like, well, call me back next week.  I might have a slot for you in two weeks.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:25):**  Like, dude, can't you get any help?  It's like, nope, nobody wants to come to work.  Everybody would rather sit at home and collect their COVID checks.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:33):**  Well, they're making they were making $600 more than we were that were working, right?  So was it a week that they were getting paid more $600 a week?  Yeah, to do nothing.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:43):**  So I mean, it's hard to argue with that because, you know, I couldn't do that mentally.  I would die if I didn't have a job.  But but yeah, it's kind of crazy.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:32:54):**  We incentivize people to stay home and not work.  Not necessarily stay home but not work.  So Adam, you mentioned that you did some ultra high density grazing.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:11):**  What does that look like in your context?  Right now, like those custom cows I've got on a couple of moves a day, I wouldn't quite  say that's high density.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:21):**  I have done high density with them where they may only be in a pasture for two to three  hours at a time.  I'm in the experimentation phase.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:28):**  I don't want to go.  You know, I've got a about not quite 7000 acres here is kind of a base to work with.  And I don't want to go stomp all 7000 acres into the ground right now and not know how  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:39):**  it's going to respond.  I'm still learning with this.  And I don't know that I'll ever have it figured out.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:44):**  But I want to see how things respond and what works for me.  I think we need to not just see one man's methods and say, well, that's the Bible and  I've got to stick with it.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:33:54):**  I can't modify it and tweak it to work for myself.  So there may be one week where I just don't have time to get out and move the fence every  day.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:03):**  And so they may be in a pasture for several days.  And then there may be another week where I can get out there three times a day.  And so they're on three times a day moves.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:10):**  And so I'm playing with it all.  And I just make notes.  And then the next year, I can go back and say, well, here's what it looked like.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:16):**  And here's how it looks now.  And this is because of this management.  And that's kind of a lot of what it's about is being willing to go out and make an experiment  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:31):**  on a small piece, and then be able to observe the results of it over a long period of time  and say, am I moving the needle in the right direction?  Is this getting better?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:41):**  Is this getting better?  Or is it going backwards?  And I think it's important that we all need to get in that mindset of spending more time  
**[0:34:49-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:49):**  out on the land and looking down, not out, and seeing what's really there going on with  the soil.  Yeah, agree 100%.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:34:59):**  So, Adam, how did you come around to regenerative agriculture and soil health principles?  I think my pursuit of perfection.  I'm naturally a perfectionist.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:35:20):**  And I've kind of got an engineering and technical mindset.  And conventional wasn't good enough for me.  One, financially, it wasn't penciling.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:35:33):**  So something needed to change.  Two, internet's a phenomenal resource where we can, you can YouTube and Facebook and Facebook  and I mean, there's so many different areas where we can find new knowledge.  
**[0:35:48-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:35:48):**  And so I think in my pursuit of perfection, and I know whenever I get there, I've found  there's always a better way.  And I think regenerative agriculture is one of the best avenues to get there.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:02):**  And it's the new buzzword, sustainable was a buzzword for a while.  And now it's regenerative.  And 15, 20 years from now, regenerative, nobody wants to do regenerative.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:13):**  That's historic.  Nobody wants to do that.  So I don't know, it's definitely overused.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:21):**  And I don't like that it is.  But it is, at least, like the New York Times folks, when they came down, you know, they  had heard the word regenerative.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:32):**  And if we can start kind of planting that into somebody that lives in Brooklyn, New  York, and if they can put regenerative and life and something that is changing from bad  to good right agriculture, then I think that's a win.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:47):**  And so I'm okay with it being used for that.  But when when you're in this circle, you have to see it and hear it every day because everybody's  using the new buzzword.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:36:57):**  Well, I actually want to share a story from this weekend, I had told some of my friends  to watch Kiss the Ground, that movie, that kind of educates consumers on regenerative  ag and changing your ecosystem so that you can combat climate change.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:37:17):**  Right.  So I had some friends I had over for dinner, and they go, CK, I've got a bone to pick with  you.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:37:24):**  Like, and I was like, what?  And they're like, we watched this movie, and this is like anti-beef industry.  And I said, no, it's not.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:37:34):**  But it's also, they have to be controversy.  There has to be controversial to get people to pay attention to it, right?  Like we have to say, this is what we're doing to our water system with glyphosate.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:37:47):**  This is what, you know, from our historical context, this is what the landscape looks  like and why.  So for me, it was like an aha moment that not all my friends have the same mindset that  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:37:58):**  I do that I thought did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:02):**  Folks, listeners, if you haven't seen that Kiss the Ground movie, where did you go watch  it?  I think it's, I think I saw it on Netflix.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:10):**  I saw it on Netflix.  Yeah.  It's been out since, I guess, November, but I just watched it last weekend.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:17):**  I knew that there was passion wrap in there.  So and I knew what the context of it was, but I just hadn't watched it.  It was fantastic.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:25):**  Yeah, it was really good.  Yeah, it was really good.  I do want to say, you know, my husband did have a good point is like, I don't want to  
**[0:38:32-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:32):**  bash a hundred years of ranchers work that they put in because they are good land stewards.  So like, we need to respect them in that sense.  But we have to realize there's a new way to do things or even just a different way to  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:48):**  do things.  There's always a different and better way.  Nobody's got it figured out.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:38:53):**  So there you go, Joel.  So what are some of the best resources you found and who are some of your mentors in  the ranching industry?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:13):**  Oh, that's a tough question.  I think I'm finding more and more that these Facebook groups have been phenomenal.  I think the first really big group that I got was in a WhatsApp group.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:28):**  I got added to a Johan Zietzmann WhatsApp group, which I think you were a part of, Brian.  I'm in there.  I just lurk.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:36):**  Yeah.  And so I, you know, I'd have something come up where, you know, I'd have a cow.  She'd be showing some symptom and I just, I didn't really know what to do and had never  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:46):**  really done anything.  I'd take a video and post on there and say, hey, what's wrong with her?  What's up?  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:52):**  How do I help her?  And so I got lots of really good input.  And from there, I've met people in person.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:39:59):**  I've called, you know, I call people from all over, been to schools with people now  where they were in those groups originally.  And that's expanded to, I'm in a group with Jaime Elizondo.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:40:12):**  And so that's been really good.  That's opened the doors to Facebook groups.  And then you get on Instagram and I, you know, I talking to you, Brian, I know you're on  
**[0:40:20-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:40:20):**  TikTok and that's kind of been a pretty big branching.  I've never done TikTok.  I don't have the app or really know how it works, but that's wild to me that you can  
**[0:40:32-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:40:32):**  learn things and ask questions and see other people's operations and challenge each other.  And social media has been one of the biggest gifts to agriculture that I think a lot of  us can take for granted.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:40:45):**  Absolutely.  You know, and I think, you know, just like this podcast, it's giving us a voice.  Absolutely.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:40:53):**  Yeah.  You know, we're kind of a minority.  I mean, 2% of us grow the food for the rest.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:41:02):**  I mean, you want to talk about minorities, we're kind of in there.  And for a long time, we haven't had a voice and we haven't really had a seat at the table  and a way to tell our story.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:41:15):**  And I think one of the blessings of COVID is it's given so many of us a chance to connect  with our consumers and start telling our story of food.  And consumers, when they're seeing these empty shelves, they're starting to ask questions  
**[0:41:33-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:41:33):**  like, hey, why am I seeing Joe Rancher out in Oklahoma complaining that he's not getting  paid a fair price for his cows?  But why is there empty shelves at the grocery store?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:41:48):**  And when you can find meat, it's twice as expensive as it was last year.  What's going on here?  And these people are starting to ask these questions.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:41:57):**  And I think that that is a great thing.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Without a doubt, my biggest worry is that people will forget and it's all going to go  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:42:09):**  over.  And COVID has not been fun.  It has been a disaster for a lot of people.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:42:15):**  I think it has the potential to make us a much more efficient economy, society, industry,  all of those things if we learn from the event.  If we forget about it next year and it's not on our radar and we don't learn from the mistakes  
**[0:42:36-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:42:36):**  and all those things, then there may not be any good come from it.  So I really hope that the common consumer remembers and realizes where their meat comes  from, where their food comes from and those types of things.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:42:55):**  As I like to say, shake the hand that feeds you.  I got to put that on a t-shirt.  We got to put that on t-shirt, CK.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:43:06):**  Before somebody else does.  There you go.  So Adam, what's something that everybody can do?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:43:18):**  Anybody listening that's not already involved in the production of protein.  What's one thing that anybody out there, say in a filing cabinet in Los Angeles or New  York, what can they do to help us start moving the needle?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:43:37):**  I think just supporting local agriculture and not going to Walmart.  I know this has been discussed a little bit on this podcast previously, but support local  agriculture.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:43:46):**  Call the local rancher or your friend or drive around.  Agriculture is everywhere in every country.  I guarantee you if somebody was looking for a better place to buy something and they drove  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:43:59):**  up to my ranch and said, hey, I'd like to deal with you.  Can I buy a beef straight off your ranch?  I'd say, heck yeah, let's do it.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:44:05):**  We'll both save money.  We'll cut out the middleman.  We're not going to waste trucking all the emissions and everything else.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:44:12):**  It would just be so much more efficient.  So I would say buy local.  That doesn't necessarily mean go to your local grocery store and buy from beef that came  
**[0:44:22-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:44:22):**  from Australia or God knows where.  Again, shake the hand that beat you.  I know it's a common theme and I know we keep saying it probably almost every episode, but  
**[0:44:35-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:44:35):**  it's important.  And I'm finding more and more as I'm getting into this presence of Regen Ag, there's a  lot of folks that are not in the industry that are just eaten up Regen Ag.  
**[0:44:50-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:44:50):**  I mean, there's somebody sent me a library of books that had several hundred books on  there that are all about regenerative agriculture that I had never even heard of.  And this guy doesn't own a cow or a sheep or a goat or a chicken or anything, but he's  
**[0:45:04-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:04):**  eaten it up.  And so it's really, really cool.  I think we need more of those people in this industry to jump in to do internships, to  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:13):**  learn.  Yeah.  And I think, yeah, they also have insights that we don't either as far as what their  
**[0:45:18-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:18):**  experience or the lens that they see the world.  So a hundred percent agree with that comment.  Some of those people can add more value to my operation by seeing things from their perspective  
**[0:45:29-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:29):**  and their lens than Brian Alexander can because Brian Alexander does a lot of the same things  that I do and we can get clouded vision and nothing against you, Brian.  But it's amazing how blinded we can be when you grow up doing it or you just do the same  
**[0:45:45-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:45):**  old same old every single day.  Absolutely.  So what can we do to start getting the next generation involved in their food system and  
**[0:45:58-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:45:58):**  excited about food production?  So one thing that New York Times article, I went to Texas Tech and ended up talking  to a few professors after that.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:46:10):**  And they're wanting to send some classes here.  And I know those are those are going to be kids that are studying ranch management and  things like that that may not necessarily even end up honestly, majority of people I  
**[0:46:21-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:46:21):**  graduated with are not in agriculture.  Majority of people I graduated with have a degree in ranch management or not even in  the agricultural industry.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:46:30):**  And so I think that's going to be a good opportunity.  We're going to start having some classes coming out as well as potentially internship opportunities  and develop and train people to be able to go out and actually do something with their  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:46:46):**  degree after they graduate.  So it's super, super exciting to see that there's two different colleges that are looking  at doing that.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:46:53):**  And I think there's going to be a lot of good opportunity there because just because you  have a degree in ranch management doesn't mean you can go manage a rancher move electric  fence or you know, Calpe de Cal.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:47:05):**  Yes, yes, yes.  And the financial side of things too.  I'm very big into the financials.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:47:13):**  I'd say that's one of my bigger strong suits.  And unfortunately, a lot of these schools, again, the school we will not speak of is  very good at the financials.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:47:23):**  But outside of that, I've just not seen it elsewhere.  And if you don't have that, you don't have anything you can't keep doing this.  If you can't make it work unless you've got some job that's going to pay you, you know,  
**[0:47:37-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:47:37):**  for the rest of your life, and you don't have to do anything but drive to the mailbox and  pull the check out.  That'd be a rough, rough life, wouldn't it?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:47:46):**  It would, it would.  Going back earlier, you said kind of maybe some, some people maybe that had been influential.  I got to meet Burke Teichert a few years ago and have have dinner with him.

One really strong suit that I wish I could, could have shadowed him for a while would  be the people side of things.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:48:11):**  He you know, he had to manage so many different people.  I think there's within ranching, there's probably no better people manager than than a gentleman  like him.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:48:19):**  So following people like him and, you know, there's a there's a whole list of folks that  are pretty good at their own little sectors and specific categories within ranching that  started to follow.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:48:34):**  And so that's been really neat.  You can find lots of YouTube videos on guys like him and, you know, Greg, Judy and Jim  Garish.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:48:44):**  And I mean, the literally there's, there's a bunch of people out there that have been  doing this a lot longer than me that I can gain experience from by watching a YouTube  video.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:48:58):**  Right on.  Well, before we switch gears and start talking about drones, because I know you want to talk  about drones a little bit.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:08):**  Even if you don't, I do.  I was gonna say Brian.  So we left, have we left anything on the table you want to you want to talk about before  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:18):**  we move on to drones?  I don't think so.  There's so many rabbit trails we could go down.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:24):**  And I think that's one reason why I love ranching because there's you get to wake up and do  something different every day.  I don't think there's we could go on for forever.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:34):**  I think I'm ready to start talking about drones because that's been an extremely valuable  tool to me and I don't think there's enough people using them.  Okay, well, let's start talking about it.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:43):**  Let's uh, so how long have you been using a drone and and what kind of drones do you  use?  So I guess my dad started out before kind of change in management and in lessees.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:49:55):**  My dad started out with a DJI Phantom.  And he had some of those and they were nice.  They're big, they're bulky, they have had pretty good quality cameras.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:05):**  This was before DJI had kind of lined out their software and he had a few go haywire  on him and just wreck themselves.  The first one wrecked with no insurance and that got expensive.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:17):**  So then he got insurance on the next one and it wrecked but they got him a new one.  And so it started with there and honestly, strictly all we've ever had is DJI brand.  They seem to be the most universal.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:31):**  They kind of seem to be the Apple of drones.  Okay, and they've worked out for us, but I guess we've been using them for several years  now.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:39):**  And honestly, when I go out of the house, you know, you make sure you got your your  keys or your phone or your wallet or your pocket knife and a drone is about the second  thing I grab on that list.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:52):**  Because it'll save me a lot of miles on wear and tear on a vehicle and save me a lot of  time too.  We'll talk about it.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:50:59):**  How does it save you time and wear and tear on your vehicles?  It depends on the time of year and what the objective is.  So one advantage to doing this higher density grazing is my cows, I can see them all from  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:51:13):**  one spot in the pasture.  And that is very convenient.  But having to shuffle through some of these bigger pastures, and I've got some other lease  
**[0:51:20-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:51:20):**  ground on stuff that is a little bit further away, I've got cows in larger pastures.  And if I'm moving, I can pick up and see if I'm missing something.  I I'll take my drone with me when I go out and feed and try to have a designated plan.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:51:36):**  So I don't have a bunch of cows chasing me halfway across the pasture trying to, you  know, run off a ton of pounds chasing the feed truck.  I can take up my drone, see where cows are at kind of get an action plan, go out, feed  
**[0:51:47-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:51:47):**  them not worry about really bothering them too much them chasing running off from their  calves, those types of things.  And I think I need to work a little bit on stockmanship and how to approach them and  
**[0:51:58-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:51:58):**  things like that to keep them from that.  But you know, literally the options are endless.  If you're looking when we have a big flood, I'll fly fences and water gaps, I've got an  
**[0:52:09-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:52:09):**  electric fence running across, you know, a river and things like that.  And so I can I can check those things.  I've got a river that runs through the property and it's about an hour and 15 minute drive  
**[0:52:23-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:52:23):**  to go from one side to the other because I have to drive all the way to the town of Canadian  and way back around.  And if I can take up my drone and fly to the other side and check things and make sure  
**[0:52:32-0:52:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:52:32):**  they're all there or not there or the fences and down or the water's okay.  I can check water with it when it's really cold out.  And there's ice all over, you know, I can make sure that if the windmills, you know,  
**[0:52:45-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:52:45):**  are pumping and water's free or if it needs to go be broken.  If I'm missing something, that's the fastest way.  I've had a rogue bull jumping the fence and trying to breed the neighbors heifers.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:52:59):**  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I see that he's if he's gone, I can take up the drone real quick and fly over  there.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:53:06):**  There he is and not have to go drive over and see and then come back and get a trailer  or whatever else that I need to do.  And then when I'm moving cattle like long distances, I can have the feed truck up front  
**[0:53:18-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:53:18):**  and drive or whatever it is and then just have the drone at the back picking up any  stragglers.  I don't have to have a second employee or somebody behind pushing something that doesn't  
**[0:53:28-0:53:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:53:28):**  want to come along.  Cows can get a little bit used to it and not worry about it as much.  Uralans you can push really well.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:53:37):**  I mean, I could move a whole herd of Uralans once they're trained to the drone without  even being out there to whatever pasture I wanted to.  And so that's really neat, especially when you're taking in custom cattle and they don't  
**[0:53:48-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:53:48):**  even have they're not even around long enough to to get tamed to it.  Because I have had some cows get tamed to it and then you try to start, you know, pop  them in the nose with the prop to try to get them to move and then it just really upsets  
**[0:54:01-0:54:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:01):**  them and then they just take off running and and that doesn't work.  So I would not advise that.  In pins, I'll use them in pins whenever I've got a gate open and I'm running stuff through  
**[0:54:11-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:11):**  but then I need I need to be behind a set of cattle but I also need somebody at that  gate.  I don't have to have somebody at that gate.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:18):**  Like an inner buy.  Yeah, I set the drone in the gate and then when I need the gate to be open, I just fly  up and raise the drone up and cattle go in and I can drop it back down.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:29):**  And so the options are endless.  The only thing that I've seen is the biggest constraint is if you've got a cow in like  an alley in a set of pins and you're trying to get her to go the other way and you try  
**[0:54:40-0:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:40):**  to hit her in the nose with the prop she she's gonna go the opposite way you want her to  go.  That's about the only time I've seen that it hasn't worked.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:49):**  Interesting.  Interesting.  So what kind of drones do you fly?  
**[0:54:52-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:54:52):**  You mentioned that you you fly DJI's and you started with a Phantom.  What do you fly in now?  Yeah, so then I went to a DJI Mini and I found the versatility of it a lot better because  
**[0:55:01-0:55:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:01):**  you know, I would throw it on my motorcycle.  That's kind of my my main method of especially in the summer when it's warmer of transport,  it's efficient, don't burn a lot of gas.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:13):**  And, you know, I could carry a few things with it.  So I throw it over my shoulder and travel around that way.  The only thing I didn't like about it is it was Wi Fi based and solely Wi Fi based the  
**[0:55:23-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:23):**  connection between the remote and the drone.  And so if I had to go very far or a hill between me and the cows or something like that, it  would lose connectivity.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:34):**  And so that one worked for me.  I bought it one month, sold it about six months later, for like $50 less than I paid for it.  That's not bad then.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:46):**  I put like 300 hours on the thing.  You know, the batteries didn't last near as long as they did when I started and I upgraded  to a DJI Mavic Air 2.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:55:57):**  And that is my current one.  And it worked out that way.  I don't know if it all will continue.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:02):**  But the game plan is probably to kind of to continue to upgrade.  They've got a pretty steep depreciation curve if you've got them for like five years or  longer, but if you can upgrade every year, the depreciation really isn't too bad.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:16):**  Sell it on eBay and buy a new one for not a whole lot more and you get you know, fresher  batteries and better technology.  And now the Air 2, I've got a lease that's four miles from me.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:27):**  I'll fly from my house to the lease, check, make sure water's working for the cows and  fly back.  And it would take me an hour and 20 minutes to drive and it takes me, you know, 16 minutes  
**[0:56:38-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:38):**  to fly it.  And you can do it from your front porch in your pajamas while you're drinking coffee.  I can do it from my office window.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:47):**  So I don't have to be outside.  Yeah, it's pretty great.  What a life of luxury.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:56:55):**  Yeah.  So I've seen the versatility of these newer drones with longer battery life, faster speeds.  And that's a big thing too that Mavic Mini, you know, we get a lot of wind.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:04):**  And if it was 30 mile an hour winds, I would be okay with dropping the drone out if I was  on the upwind side of the pasture and I was going to drive to the back end.  But if I was on the downwind side, there was no way I was going to take it up, fight against  
**[0:57:18-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:18):**  the wind and then have enough battery to get myself back.  And so that's kind of a tactic I've taken to if I need to take the drone up, scout out,  see where things are at.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:27):**  I'll go on the upwind side and then drive through and pick it up on that downwind side  and it'll save me a lot of battery life.  That's a good tip.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:36):**  See, I have a Mavic Air.  I don't have the Air 2, I have the original Air.  And that's really nice, but it has a controller.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:46):**  And so I can, I can fly it either off my phone or off the controller.  And that thing's pocket size.  Like it's the same footprint as your phone, but it's, you know, a couple inches thick.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:57:57):**  So you can dang near fit that thing in a pocket.  But my favorite drone to use is going to be my Mavic 2 Zoom.  Because that zoom lens, I can really, I can really punch in close and do a close investigation  
**[0:58:15-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:15):**  and keep that noise envelope with a drone way outside of any animal's flight zone.  How much are those?  Are they like 500 bucks?  
**[0:58:26-0:58:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:26):**  Keep going.  More?  More, keep going.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:29):**  I mean, they're high.  A thousand dollars?  Yeah, they're high.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:32):**  But it's a work tool.  Like, you know.  Oh no, I just, I just was wondering.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:36):**  That's why I asked.  Yeah.  So the Mini that I'd bought, I think was 500 and then I sold it for like 450.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:43):**  The Air 2 I bought was 1100.  I always get the Fly More package.  It comes with three batteries rather than just one and usually a carrying case and a  
**[0:58:51-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:51):**  few other accessories.  It's far worth it because those batteries are about $100 a pop anyways and it's usually  only about 100 bucks more to get the Fly More.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:58:59):**  So that is definitely worth it.  I do like the Air 2 also does have zoom.  It's not, doesn't have the zoom that you have, Brian.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:05):**  It's a digital zoom.  What's zoom?  Is this faster?  
**[0:59:08-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:08):**  No, it's a zoom lens on the camera.  Oh.  Zoom, zoom, no, it goes faster.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:14):**  Okay.  CK.  Yeah.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:17):**  So I thought totally, I thought Brian was coming to record this episode with you too  for context.  Like I was like, oh, that's cool.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:22):**  You're going to go record a drone podcast episode.  He's like, no CK, we're going to talk about flying drones.  We're going to do a podcast about, you know, half about drones.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:34):**  So yeah, it went over my head.  Sorry.  The zoom option has been great for reading your tags.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:41):**  If I know I've got a problem or if I've got a cow that's behind, I can zoom in.  I can see that it's ear tag 426.  And then if I need to relay that to someone else, I can say, Hey, your tag 426 needs this  
**[0:59:52-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=0:59:52):**  or is here or whatever.  And there's a lot of communication barriers that you can break down there.  So well, I don't know where she's at.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:02):**  I didn't find her.  All right, well, hang on.  Just follow the drone and she will, I will, I will lead you right to where you need to  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:10):**  be.  One thing I really like to is tracks, it'll track where you've been.  And then you can drop a point.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:15):**  And I'll take a screenshot of that.  And then I can share it with someone.  So if I've got a specific location that I need to pinpoint, I can drop a point, they  
**[1:00:24-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:24):**  can see where I was at, I can text somebody and they can say, Okay, well, that's where  he's at, or that's where it's at, or whatever.  And then they know.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:33):**  So that's been nice.  I would like to use more monitoring with it, going up taking satellite, basically satellite  photos of my ranch on a pasture level basis.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:43):**  For inventory.  Yeah, I think that's a much, much more expensive sensor than what we've had.  Yeah.  
**[1:00:52-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:00:52):**  Well, and I'm not talking about NDVI.  Because there is NDVI options.  I'm talking about just basic, basic photos, you can see, even from that, you know, I'm  
**[1:01:04-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:04):**  primarily weeds are primarily grass or what everything looks like, from a pasture wide  scale.  And so I've not done enough of that.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:15):**  I've dabbled in it a little bit.  But I think there's a lot of options.  And then you can get into thermal camera options and been able to find for nighttime through  
**[1:01:24-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:24):**  brush.  Well, not necessarily in nighttime, daytime, much in the daytime.  Oh, okay.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:29):**  You can find that calf that's hiding behind the sagebrush in the shadow that you drove  past three feet away and didn't see.  True.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:37):**  Right.  Do they have lights on it too?  These don't, drones, sorry.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:42):**  Yeah, mine's got an LED on the bottom that you can shine.  And you know, really, if you're about 10 foot or lower, it's beneficial.  Other than that, it's it kind of it's pointless.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:01:54):**  Okay.  Or if you're flying at dusk, and you need to figure out where the heck it's at, you  can turn that thing on and from, you know, half a mile away, you can see where it's  
**[1:02:01-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:02:01):**  to guide it.  Yeah, that's what the go home buttons for.  There are some some enterprise level drones from DJI, which I mean, you know, we're talking  
**[1:02:11-1:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:02:11):**  about stuff that's in 1000 $1500 range in their consumer range, which is, you know,  kind of reasonable budget that a working cow man can afford.  Some of their enterprise stuff is just absolutely phenomenal.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:02:23):**  I was looking at one called the Matrice 300, which just came out and I've got a new camera  hanging on it.  That's got four sensors, and it has up to a 40 times optical zoom lens on it.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:02:38):**  Yeah, and then it can then it's got some digital zoom it can do pass that.  But it also integrates a thermal sensor behind that zoom lens.  Oh, wow.  
**[1:02:50-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:02:50):**  So that's, yeah.  So that calf that's hiding behind the sagebrush in the shadow, a mile away, you can see it  with that thing.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:03:00):**  But that's also like a $33,000 piece of hardware.  So if there's anybody out there listening that has way too much money, and wants to  donate me a Matrice 3000 with I think the camera's called an HT 20.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:03:16):**  I'd be happy to use that give give all kinds of reviews on it.  And I'll even use it for burning season, which is coming up.  Because having a thermal camera and a high endurance drone with an awesome zoom lens  
**[1:03:29-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:03:29):**  would do absolute wonders for our burn association.  But that is a different podcast.  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:03:38):**  I am.  I think you can help folks out to I one of my clients, I was on his place and he's like  a 70 something year old rancher and he had his hand had called him that morning and he'd  
**[1:03:50-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:03:50):**  had a cow that was you know, had some blood on her ear in but they weren't didn't have  a calf with her and it was way before cabin season and he's like, Oh, I got my drone in  the pickup.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:01):**  Let's just take it up and see if we can go find something.  Anyways, we took it up and didn't see anything.  But after he saw that he was like, wow, this is really cool.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:08):**  But there was kind of a barrier to entry with his technological sense and an age versus  their I mean, there's some older folks that can be could pick it up.  They're very user friendly and very easy to fly.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:21):**  Somebody you may look into getting on the podcast.  He called me and I helped him out.  Justin raider with hundred meridian ranching.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:29):**  He's been a working cows guest.  But he called me up.  He did not have a drone and he had a place leased and some cows that had gotten out on  
**[1:04:38-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:38):**  a river and no telling how far they were going.  And so I met them over and they went horseback and went down in the river and I was able  to take up a big drone and start flying and, you know, call them and say, hey, you've got  
**[1:04:50-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:50):**  cattle here, here and here.  And it saved them a lot of time of trying to track through brush and grass and everything  else just trying to pick up, you know, where things were at.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:04:59):**  And so the options are endless.  It's amazing.  You can say, well, I'm going to use it for this.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:05:04):**  And then you'll have it and then you'll say, oh, well, I can use it for this too, right  to and you'll start using it more and more and more.  So it's one of the best write offs I've had for sure.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:05:16):**  Yeah, it's not a toy.  I mean, we got to get that straight.  I mean, it's not a fifteen hundred dollar toy drone.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:05:24):**  It is a fifteen hundred dollar investment in a work tool that if you learn to use it  properly can save you 10x in time and money in probably the first year.  Yeah, especially rough country.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:05:39):**  If you're bouncing around having to go two miles an hour in a pickup for, you know, all  the wear and tear on a vehicle, it saves money there pretty dang quick.  So I guess if guys are looking for somewhere to for a 10x in their business, this might  
**[1:05:53-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:05:53):**  be one of them.  You know, a fifteen hundred dollar drone, you can leverage that to fifteen thousand  dollars worth of time and repair savings.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:06:01):**  Yeah, I think each person is different, but some operations could really, really take  advantage of that.  And it would be a very big asset that they could add to their add to their toolbox.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:06:17):**  So Adam, you're a sharp guy and I know you like to think about concessionizing and enterprising.  Can you imagine what a full time enterprise for somebody flying a drone in supportive  ranching would look like?  
**[1:06:35-1:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:06:35):**  I guess the context I'm asking that in is, you know, imagine our listeners sitting in  Wichita or Kansas City or L.A. or wherever everybody's at.  Sorry if I offend everybody.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:06:48):**  Texas, Dallas.  I know I've got a bunch of listeners in Texas.  So they're sitting in a filing cabinet and they're wondering, I'm a techie guy.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:06:56):**  How can I apply my skills to get out into ranching?  So I may need you to rephrase that.  It sounds like two different questions potentially.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:07:09):**  One, are you asking for a techie guy that wants to get into ranching or two, that you're  asking if someone wants to get into just drone stuff and benefit ranchers, how do they get  into that industry?  
**[1:07:24-1:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:07:24):**  I guess kind of what I'm asking is a hybrid of the two questions.  Like, you know, that that's kind of the avatar that we're you're thinking about with this  question and what would a full time drone flying enterprise look like for somebody like  
**[1:07:40-1:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:07:40):**  that?  I think it could be multifaceted.  I think if you're in ranching country, it could be some operation that's, you know,  
**[1:07:50-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:07:50):**  doing some large, you know, I'm thinking Nevada multi hundred thousand acre places with very  large pastures that are doing cattle drives and trying to pick up, you know, the herd  and things like that.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:08:02):**  I think they could hire a group of people potentially with several different drones  to go out and have a, you know, a drone operator with a set of cowboys and be able to go out  and find cattle that you might need.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:08:16):**  And then I also think it could be, you know, somebody who's great at video editing and  marketing and they could go out to so for example, Deborah Clark, she mentors me and  the Birdwell and Clark Ranch, you know, they've they do the really big herds, you know, five  
**[1:08:32-1:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:08:32):**  6000 head of yearlings in one herd type stuff.  And whenever you get to get videos of drones with cattle and one big herd moving on, it's  really, really cool.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:08:43):**  And I think there's lots of opportunity to show what we can do.  You know, somebody in Brooklyn, New York, see something like that has to ask if they  have a brain.  
**[1:08:53-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:08:53):**  Well, what the heck is going on here?  And if they're inquisitive at all, then maybe it'll get them down that regenerative agriculture  path and they'll say, hey, maybe agriculture is okay.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:09:02):**  And so I think there could be, you know, marketing potential, I think there could be practical  day work potential.  I think there's a lot of opportunity and as technology progresses, it's going to get even  
**[1:09:16-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:09:16):**  better and better with the opportunities that could come up.  I hope that answers your question.  That was a great answer.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:09:28):**  I liked it.  I did.  So last week, DJI came out with a new drone.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:09:41):**  And you know, we've been kind of I've been watching for the Mavic three series like the  Mavic two replacement should have been coming like any time and we haven't seen it yet.  But what we have seen is that new FPV drone from DJI.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:09:56):**  And if you just look at the specs, it's not that impressive.  20, 21 minute flight time.  But I watched a review on it.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:06):**  And it'll fly 89 miles an hour.  Oh, I did not realize that.  Wow.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:12):**  Doesn't that seem dangerous?  Okay, so the biggest barrier I have is when I have a 40 mile an hour wind, especially  like we'll get these raging wildfires.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:19):**  And I thought man, a drone would be very so I'm, as an aside, I'm a pilot, helicopter  and airplane pilot.  And so I see the value in a lot of that.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:29):**  When there's wildfires, and you could, you know, go tell somebody or buzz their house,  they can look outside and see if there's smoke pummeling out their back door.  Drones have been a problem because usually you've got 70 mile an hour winds on those  
**[1:10:41-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:41):**  types of days.  And if you take up a drone, it's going to be going downwind even pointed into the wind  pretty stinking fast.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:47):**  Right?  I could see a drone like that being beneficial.  Yeah, it's, I'm not sure.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:10:55):**  I'm not sure I really like the price point of that.  But you know,  what is the price on it?  
**[1:11:01-1:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:01):**  It's kind of like anything else they've got on their top end of the line.  It's about 1500.  But it doesn't have a fly more kit.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:06):**  You only get one battery with it for that.  Don't ever buy a drone with one battery.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:14):**  That doesn't work.  No, three batteries and a 12 volt charger so you can keep it your side by side or your  pickup.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:22):**  And as soon as you bring that soon as you recover that drone, you pop that battery out  you just used and put it in the charger and get another one recycled ready to go.  One thing that I don't like that they have implemented on these newer drones like the

So if you charge up your batteries, after three days, they automatically discharge themselves  
**[1:11:46-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:46):**  to about 75%.  And then they'll even start discharging a little bit more after that.  So if you don't haven't used a battery within the last two weeks, you may only have half  
**[1:11:56-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:11:56):**  the battery life and the intention behind it is to, you know, retain battery life over  time it can supposedly cycle more and you're not gonna have to buy batteries as often,  you know, instead of every year, maybe every couple years, I don't know.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:12):**  I when I had the New York Times guys out George Steinmetz if you guys if y'all have not seen  some of his photography, get on Instagram and check it out.  It is phenomenal.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:20):**  But I was just looking at the article.  I love those photos.  Those are his photos.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:25):**  We had several different photographers.  Okay.  One was from a guy in Oklahoma City and then George is he works for National Geographic.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:31):**  So he's Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Makes sense.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:34):**  Plus countries.  Yeah.  And beautiful photos.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:37):**  And what he taught me is he uses drones so much that the batteries actually expand not  just when they're hot, they actually expand over time.  And so he'll be flying along and it'll expand so much, it'll pop out.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:49):**  And then the drone just crashes because now it has no more battery life.  And so I think they were having some problems like that on some of their older generation  stuff.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:12:57):**  And so now they've started this automatic battery, you know, it loses power over time,  or you know, if it hadn't been used in three days to make the lifelong  Yeah, self conditioning routine deal.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:13:11):**  They're probably just wearing themselves out to make us buy replacements more often.  I want to say that but yeah, that's what I think about my iPhones.  Insurance is another thing we touched on.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:13:22):**  I bought it for mine.  I think it's I know I paid $40 a year that may have been on the mini now maybe $99 a  year.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:13:34):**  But if you're going to get into the drone thing starting out for sure by the insurance,  because it's a it'll pay for itself the first time you wreck it and you will have some wrecks  if you're learning to do it.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:13:46):**  Yeah, yeah.  If you're inquisitive at all, you'll you'll have some right if you're a male with some  testosterone, you'll probably have some wrecks.  
**[1:13:53-1:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:13:53):**  You will crash it, you will crash it.  And if you have the insurance, it will not be expensive.  So let's circle back around.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:01):**  I feel like we've covered drones pretty well.  You mentioned insurance.  You're just talking about drone insurance.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:09):**  And for some reason, I started thinking about rain insurance.  So let's, let's talk about rain insurance a little bit and why that could be beneficial  for some producers and why it doesn't fit all programs.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:20):**  Yeah.  So the government came out and it's still in the test phases, even though it's been  out for 10 years now.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:29):**  It's called PRF, Pasture, Rangeland, Forage, Rainfall insurance.  It's a government subsidized program that private crop insurance agents sell.  So I'm a private crop insurance agent.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:42):**  And how it works is basically a rancher can ensure anywhere from 75 to 90% of average  rainfall for their grid.  So they've got these grids all across the United States.  
**[1:14:55-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:14:55):**  They're about a 50.  It depends on where you are, how far you're from the equator, but about a 12 by 12 or  12 by 15 mile area.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:15:02):**  Your ranch may be in it in several different grids.  And they've got historical rainfall data for that grid.  And you ensure on two month intervals.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:15:12):**  So basically, if you wanted to say I want to ensure January, February and March, April  and May, June, etc.  Then if January, February were 90% or drier than average, then it would trigger an indemnity  
**[1:15:25-1:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:15:25):**  and you might get paid out.  We see as you move further east, it doesn't seem to be a profitable thing to sign up for.  Eastern Kansas, Missouri is about as far east as I've seen it be worthwhile.  
**[1:15:40-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:15:40):**  You go out to Florida and Tennessee and some places like that.  Occasionally, you'll find a grid that's worth it.  But generally out west is where it's drier is kind of where it seems to pay out more  
**[1:15:52-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:15:52):**  consistently because drought is more of a consistent thing.  I think it's a great program.  It's not flawless by any means.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:03):**  It is government subsidized.  There's some things that they're starting to work through.  It's still in its trial phases.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:11):**  And so I hope that it will get better over time.  But I think it's a good tool in the toolbox.  For the financial investment or lack thereof, because the government essentially pays about  
**[1:16:23-1:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:23):**  half the premium.  They pay the first half upfront.  So if I sign up, you sign up in the fall.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:29):**  So if I signed up fall of 2021, it would be to ensure all of 2022.  And I would not owe any check the earliest I would have to write any check would be due  October 1 of 2022.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:43):**  So essentially, if you're dry through the first half of the year, they're going to start  applying those losses towards your premium.  And in a lot of places, you wouldn't have written one check in the last 10 years, all  
**[1:16:56-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:16:56):**  you'd have done is signed up and you'd receive checks in the mail.  And so it is the government's way to have crop insurance on rangeland because we don't  measure bushels or anything like that.  
**[1:17:09-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:17:09):**  We measure solely based on rainfall.  That's how much forage we get typically is based upon how much rain we get.  And so that is their way of doing it.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:17:17):**  In an ideal world, there would be no subsidies, in my opinion, we would just be a you know,  capitalism and you know, I can raise what I want and I can trade for what I want and  commodities are worth what they're supposed to be worth.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:17:30):**  And you know, I know beef rice, you wouldn't be selling feeder cattle for $1.50 I can tell  you that it would be a lot higher than that.  But it's the world we live in, it fits a door for another regenerative, progressive rancher  
**[1:17:44-1:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:17:44):**  to get into the business.  If this is a game changer between them making a profit and not making a profit, and potentially  getting larger land holdings and affecting more land in a positive way, then I'm all  
**[1:17:56-1:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:17:56):**  for it.  So that's kind of my mindset behind it.  It's not a tool for everybody, but it's definitely a tool.  
**[1:18:05-1:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:18:05):**  Right, and thanks for that.  So where can people go more if they're interested to learn more about PRF?  Um, you can Google just PRF, USDA PRF, and they've got so it's administered through the  
**[1:18:20-1:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:18:20):**  risk management agency, which is a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture.  Hey, I'm trying to give you an opportunity to make a sales pitch, buddy.  Okay.  
**[1:18:32-1:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:18:32):**  So you can call me at 806-217-2278.  We can chat about it.  I can pull up your ranch with just a little bit of zip code and a little bit more, you  
**[1:18:45-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:18:45):**  know, an address or something like that.  I can look at historicals, I can tell you more about the program, I can give you really  anything you need to know about it.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:18:54):**  There also are resources online that the USDA has put out that you can look up to learn  a little bit more about it.  Or if you need me to send you a flyer, email or something else just to learn a little bit  
**[1:19:04-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:19:04):**  more about it, you can sure do that.  But it's a case by case basis, and it can be a little bit overwhelming initially trying  to figure it out and learn about it.  
**[1:19:13-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:19:13):**  And so honestly, talking with someone that sells it is probably the best way to learn  and to see if it's a fit for your operation.  Great.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:19:22):**  Do you have a website somebody can go to?  Yeah, so I sell through it's called Ozark Hills Insurance.  My email is adam at Ozark Hills insurance.com.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:19:34):**  We've got a website too, but it's not necessarily anything PRF related.  We've got all different other types of insurance and things like that.  And then of course, my number 806-217-2278.  
**[1:19:49-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:19:49):**  You can call or email or text or whatever anytime if you want me to look up your place  or see if it's fit for you.  I don't think I want to put a phone number in the show notes page, but I will put your  
**[1:20:00-1:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:00):**  email address in.  Yeah, I was gonna say that.  Okay, sounds good.  
**[1:20:03-1:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:03):**  I'm gonna start getting robocalled.  There you go.  I got a few call lists I could add you to, good buddy.  
**[1:20:12-1:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:12):**  I've been getting so many calls lately, it's ridiculous.  I've been getting healthcare stuff right now because it must be the time that they're turning  over things.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:19):**  I'm like, oh.  Is your vehicle warranty expired too?  No, not yet.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:23):**  Oh, mine is.  Yeah.  Yeah, my warranty expired on my 1973 Peterbilt.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:30):**  You want to go ahead and extend that out for me there, buddy?  There you go.  So besides your drone, what are some of the other indispensable tools or resources that  
**[1:20:44-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:44):**  you have that you use every day?  My phone, man, honestly, my phone, just because I can do all the social media and all of that  stuff with it is a pretty indispensable tool.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:20:57):**  I think also kind of the friend group that I've developed to bounce ideas off of folks  from California and Idaho to Oklahoma and Texas that I talked to about on a weekly basis  kind of bouncing ideas off of other generally younger ranchers that are kind of in the same,  
**[1:21:19-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:21:19):**  maybe completely different operation, but they're within the beef industry and their  ranching that I can kind of bounce ideas off of, I think.  I think we've all got to develop some form of a community to call each other when you  
**[1:21:32-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:21:32):**  got a question or have trouble or just need somebody to talk to.  It's a mental health thing.  It's a lack of experience thing.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:21:43):**  It's a community thing.  There's just so many advantages to that.  So honestly, I'd say my cell phone, I kind of try to make sure I've got it with me at  
**[1:21:52-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:21:52):**  most times, whether it be an emergency or I've got a question.  Right.  Cool.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:21:59):**  So how about this?  You like to fly.  I remember when we took Wally's school together, I had to come pick you up from the airport.  
**[1:22:09-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:09):**  So if you were going to take a cross country flight, doesn't really matter the airplane,  who would you want to be your co-pilot?  Did they have to be a pilot?  
**[1:22:22-1:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:22):**  Or they just sit in the co-pilot seat?  They can just be there to keep you company or they can help you drive.  You know, I would probably pick like, I think I would pick, do they have to be alive?  
**[1:22:42-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:42):**  Why not?  No, no.  No?  
**[1:22:45-1:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:45):**  No, we'll resurrect somebody for this one.  Okay.  If we're resurrecting somebody, I know it was thrown out on another podcast.  
**[1:22:52-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:52):**  We bring dead people back for dinner all the time.  So you can bring somebody dead back for a plane ride.  It would be Stan Parsons.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:22:58):**  I think being a numbers guy, I would love to be able to have a conversation with him.  And, you know, when you're in an airplane, you can't just get out.  You really can't just mute somebody either.  
**[1:23:09-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:09):**  And so they'd be stuck with me.  So I think that's who I'd pick.  Wow, that's great.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:16):**  I like that.  That's pretty cool.  So we're starting to wind down here, buddy.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:22):**  You got anything?  What's on your mind?  Anything you want to ask me or CK?  
**[1:23:28-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:28):**  I would want to say thanks to y'all for undertaking this because I know now I'm seeing kind of  on the back end that this is quite a bit of work.  But I think it's pivotal.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:39):**  And there's a lot of people that are starting to get into the podcast field.  And I think we need more of this.  You know, Working Cows is great and Ranching Reboot is great.  
**[1:23:49-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:49):**  And there's several others that are great.  But I would challenge somebody if they're on the fence about starting a podcast to go  ahead and take a leap of faith and try it out.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:23:59):**  Whether it's ranching or not, whether it's mental health or whether, you know, whatever.  There's gonna be somebody about, yeah, there's gonna be somebody that's gonna be able to  get a lot of good out of it.  
**[1:24:12-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:12):**  And so I would challenge them to that.  Questions.  I want to learn a little bit more about CK.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:17):**  I don't know if that's an option or an opportunity.  Yeah.  I know Brian pretty well from previous stuff.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:26):**  And I'd like to learn a little bit more about CK.  Fire away.  I get that question on social media and I've got that question several times.  
**[1:24:32-1:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:32):**  We'd like to know a little bit more.  Who's CK?  Who's this hype man?  
**[1:24:36-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:36):**  Yeah, who's this chick CK?  Let's hear about her.  Pretty private.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:39):**  But I'm willing to become more open through this podcast.  So I am from California from the San Joaquin Valley.  So if you know California at all, it's Tulare County is one of the biggest ag counties in  
**[1:24:56-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:24:56):**  California.  So when people, you know, oh, you're from California.  You're one of those crazy hippie, Democrat Californians.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:25:04):**  And I'm like, I'm from the good part of California.  I'm not any of the, I am a little bit of a hippie, but I'm from a very agricultural rich  town.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:25:12):**  And I'm right at the base of the Sequoia National Park or Sierra Nevada.  So we have really fertile soil and a lot of irrigated systems.  So we really, I've seen almost every crop raised and animal raised.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:25:27):**  It's a huge dairy community and we also have a huge beef community.  But as far as, I mean, I guess what do you want to know?  There's a lot to know about me.  
**[1:25:35-1:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:25:35):**  So I think that's why as like my ag background, just kind of growing up around it.  Went to school, didn't know what I wanted to do other than I knew I wanted to do kind  of ag related since that seems where I was from.  
**[1:25:49-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:25:49):**  I ended up getting heavily involved in livestock production.  Thought I was going to go into the feedlot system.  I worked at the university farm.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:00):**  I did a feedlot internship with Harris Ranch.  And that was just, I mean, that was the hardest work I've ever done in my life.  Like 60 to 90 hour work weeks.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:10):**  I smelled terrible, but I worked really hard and I learned a lot of stuff as far as like  processing cattle, looking at cattle, feeding cattle, and then just learning from other  people in the community that worked really hard too.  
**[1:26:25-1:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:25):**  I decided that I didn't want to end up my life in the feed mill, in the feedlot system.  I felt like that's where I was being positioned and I wanted to be more of a manager.  So I felt like I wasn't going to be welcomed in the feedlot community as a female manager,  
**[1:26:41-1:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:41):**  to be honest.  And so I was like, okay, so I'll go into sales.  I worked at Olive Garden.  
**[1:26:48-1:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:48):**  I was really good at that kind of stuff.  I felt like I had that foundational knowledge with what they do with training you with,  you know, serving, you learn a lot with sales.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:26:56):**  I ended up working for Animal Health International.  I hated it.  I was sitting in a cubicle for 40 hours a week and I was like, I don't want to do this.  
**[1:27:08-1:27:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:27:08):**  I quit that and actually, I don't think anyone knows this, but I actually was a pistachio  broker for a while.  Yeah.  
**[1:27:18-1:27:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:27:18):**  You know, where I was from, there's a lot of the tree nuts, so there's a lot of almonds.  So we're south of Sacramento, so we don't call them almonds.  We call them almonds.  
**[1:27:28-1:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:27:28):**  A lot of walnuts.  And I had known someone who broke her walnuts and she loved her job.  She loved doing the relationship piece with the ranchers, I guess is what they're called.  
**[1:27:40-1:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:27:40):**  And so I was like, okay, well, I want to do that, but I'll do the pistachio side.  So I ended up working for a pistachio processor and grower and managing all of the grower  relationships.  
**[1:27:51-1:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:27:51):**  And then in that process, Pasture Map started becoming a thing.  They knew that I had background in feedlot and pasture management.  We had transitioned a conventional dairy over to organic and we also had a rangeland on  
**[1:28:07-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:28:07):**  our university farm that we took care of the cows on.  And Pasture Map kind of recruited me because of my Chico State Ag.  We have a regenerative ag program to do that and I've been doing that for like five years  
**[1:28:25-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:28:25):**  now.  So I don't know, does that answer your question?  That's a lot of information.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:28:29):**  Yeah, it does.  That gives me a, there could be a lot of other and a whole nother episode I'm sure of questions  arise from that.  
**[1:28:36-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:28:36):**  But I've had other people say, I don't know who this CK person is.  And I hope that gave them a little bit of a taste of who you are.  Yeah, I think I probably need to be more intentional about getting out there.  
**[1:28:49-1:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:28:49):**  But I think I'm like you with not intentionally being out there on Facebook and stuff.  I meet with ranchers one-on-one all the time with Pasture Map and that's like my best comfort  zone is just meeting up with them one-on-one.  
**[1:29:03-1:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:03):**  But when it comes to like when people ask me to do speaking engagements, when they ask  me to have an opinion, I don't really like to just because I'm very much don't want to  ruffle any tail feathers.  
**[1:29:18-1:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:18):**  And so I'm more of a listener than I am about giving opinions.  But I feel like that's changing with Ranching Reboot because everyone's like, oh, I heard  your podcast like you and Red Hill Rancher podcast.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:29):**  I'm like, oh, do you guys actually listen to that?  That's crazy.  So I have been getting that feedback a lot.  
**[1:29:35-1:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:35):**  And so thank you for asking that.  Yeah, for sure.  You know, the last guest that that we interviewed the last that aired as we're recording this  
**[1:29:45-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:45):**  and it's obviously going to be kind of released out of order, we got a few more coming up  that are going to come out before this one.  Previous guest Ariel Greenwood, you know, she's kind of the original grass nomad.  
**[1:29:56-1:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:29:56):**  I mean, she's been everywhere from North Carolina to California, from Montana to New Mexico,  and she does travel back and forth quite a bit.  And you know, a theme that's come up with previous guests with Michael from Reverend  
**[1:30:09-1:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:30:09):**  Wild Ranch and with Hobbs Magaree from Sisters Cattle Company is the difference in terminology.  Okay, so like east of the Mississippi, everything's a farm.  But there's a big swath in here through the Midwest and the plains and the Intermountain  
**[1:30:29-1:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:30:29):**  West that a ranch has cattle on it.  A ranch is a big, big piece of land with cattle on it.  And a farm is something with tractors and implements that raises crops.  
**[1:30:41-1:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:30:41):**  But then you get out to California, and everything's a ranch.  There's no farms in California, they call everything a ranch.  It's like, oh, Christopher Ranch strawberries, like, it's not a ranch, it's a frickin strawberry  
**[1:30:54-1:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:30:54):**  farm guys.  So there is some interesting terminology going on here.  And that was that was just a little rabbit trail I kind of wanted to wander off down.  
**[1:31:03-1:31:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:03):**  But the dairy guys there, they're dairy farmers.  They're not ranchers.  So it's, I don't think anybody calls themselves a dairy rancher.  
**[1:31:13-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:13):**  Yeah, even here, here, they don't think so.  Okay.  I guess people have larger land tracks.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:20):**  You're right.  So I don't know why I said that.  Maybe there's some dairy ranchers somewhere, but yeah, you're in the Texas Panhandle.  
**[1:31:26-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:26):**  They're all farmers.  I guess it's just an interesting, kind of interesting comparison of terminology in the  way that, you know, that we don't realize that not all of the language that we use in  
**[1:31:39-1:31:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:39):**  the industry is universal, from East Coast to West Coast or from Mexico to Canada,  even from conventional to progressive.  So it's different.  
**[1:31:51-1:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:31:51):**  Like, Brian, you've heard the word pugging up a pasture, right?  Like if it's wet out.  So the cattle owners of the cattle on custom grazing right now, we're out here yesterday,  
**[1:32:02-1:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:02):**  and I was just showing them, we'd just gotten some rain.  I said, yeah, I really plugged this up over here.  And they said, pug, what the heck is that?  
**[1:32:08-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:08):**  You know, and they're ranchers that have been ranching for over 100 years.  They'd never heard the word pug.  They don't use electric fencing.  
**[1:32:13-1:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:13):**  So it's not really ever been an issue.  You know, I think in our soils, our sandy or loamy soils, I think with the proper rest,  that pugging is not an issue.  
**[1:32:22-1:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:22):**  It doesn't cause compaction.  I think the guys that are having problems with pugging are in the heavier clay soils  or the soils that are so depleted in organic matter that already have a dead hard pan under  
**[1:32:35-1:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:35):**  them.  It's got the bulk density of frickin' concrete, you know, four inches down at the plow line.  I'm sorry, guys.  
**[1:32:42-1:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:42):**  Your cows did not cause that compaction at four inches.  100 years of tillage has caused that compaction layer at four inches.  Not your cows.  
**[1:32:53-1:33:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:32:53):**  Sorry.  Yep.  I think it's an appropriate time to throw a Ray Archuleta quote out.  
**[1:33:01-1:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:01):**  He says, the only compaction problem on the farm is compaction of the mind.  Mind.  Yep.  
**[1:33:08-1:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:08):**  That's good.  He said that at Soil Health U.  That was 2020.  
**[1:33:13-1:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:13):**  That was last year, right before the world ended with COVID.  It's 600 people in that main hall.  And Ray said the only compaction problem on the farm is compaction of the mind.  
**[1:33:25-1:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:25):**  And you could just see all these old farmers doing it.  Who was it that asked what do all ranchers and farmers have in common?  And you know, now that I think about it, it's like everything always is just, you can sum  
**[1:33:41-1:33:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:41):**  it up to a management issue.  Like it's always human barriers that you have to get past before you can make any changes.  And I think that's one of the things that Burke Teichert likes to unpack a lot is he  
**[1:33:54-1:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:33:54):**  keeps trying to ask the why question, and he gets down to the seventh layer.  And by the time you get down to the seventh layer, it's like, there's something a human  being could have done to change the outcome.  
**[1:34:07-1:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:07):**  And it was a very small change.  So guys, did we leave anything on the table today, Adam?  Is there anything else you want to get off your chest?  
**[1:34:22-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:22):**  I don't think so.  Again, I could go down rabbit trail after rabbit trail, but no, this was good.  I enjoyed it.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:27):**  I hope people benefit from it.  I hope people are curious about the drone deal and they look into it and realize that  it could be an asset to their operation.  
**[1:34:39-1:34:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:39):**  So a good deal.  CK, did we leave anything on the table today?  No, that was a really good episode.  
**[1:34:49-1:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:49):**  So all right.  Very fun.  I think we're going to go ahead and get out of here.  
**[1:34:55-1:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:34:55):**  I'm going to roll through an outro.  Mr. Isaacs, it has been an absolute pleasure for you joining us today, and we really appreciate  your time and hopefully you'll come back again.  
**[1:35:07-1:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/9--Adam-Issacs-Conventional-wasnt-good-enough-for-me-ev2cnb#t=1:35:07):**  Thanks for the opportunity.  Well, this is Red Hills Ranger on behalf of CK, my wonderful cohost and our guest today,  Adam.

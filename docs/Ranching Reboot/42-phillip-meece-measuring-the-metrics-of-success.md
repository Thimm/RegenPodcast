**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:00:53):**  Hey, been a while.  Yeah, it has, man.  You look good.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:00:56):**  I was thinking that was Grass-fed Exchange 2019, right?  Yeah.  Out there, the legendary Grass-fed Exchange of 2019 out there in beautiful California.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:01:08):**  CK, have you met Philip?  I was at the same Grass Exchange, but I don't think we've met personally.  So it's nice to meet you, Philip.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:01:19):**  So Philip is, I brought Philip on the show today to talk about the Carnivore Bar.  And yeah, well, we'll do video in season two.  We're working on that still, but I do love the signs.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:01:33):**  Great marketing.  I was going through some of your social media, man.  You're just, it looks like you're killing it.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:01:38):**  So why don't you just give us a brief overview of what the Carnivore Bar is and we can kind  of start to unpack some of it.  So the Carnivore Bar is, this food is old as time.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:01:49):**  It's pemmican.  It's a native American food to make meat shelf stable.  So it's integrally related to what ranchers do.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:02:01):**  They raise the most nutritious food in the planet.  And the only problem is it's highly perishable.  So the whole processing and logistics of getting it to the customer is always the biggest issue.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:02:17):**  And modern techniques include a lot of chemicals and a lot of different hermectins or drying  agents that don't always sit very well with people's diets and their lifestyle.  So it turns out a long time ago, probably before recorded history, people were figuring  
**[0:02:37-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:02:37):**  this out and just making their beef really, really dry, sun dried ground with mortar and  pestle and then, you know, cast iron pot rendering the tallow by hand.  I mean, it must have taken weeks, but they did it.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:02:55):**  And it became a really important commodity before refrigeration was available.  People out in the wilderness didn't always have successful hunts, didn't always have  successful foraging.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:09):**  You can't find food.  It's good to pack a backup plan.  For sure.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:18):**  Just a note on that, even some of the most successful predators in the wild only have  about a 10% success rate on a hunt.  So you know, if you're out there one out every four years and you manage to get your deer  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:30):**  feel better, you're probably doing on average better than the mountain lions doing per hunt.  That's a good point.  It's a good point.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:38):**  It's a silver lining.  So pocket meat, right?  That's what we're talking about.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:43):**  We're talking about a piece of meat you can put in your pocket, walk around with all day  and take it out when you want to eat it.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:49-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:03:49):**  And so the key of pemmican back in the day is the same key.  Now it's getting it dry enough.  You know, if it's wet, it's extremely perishable, you know, and it, and what we do with our  
**[0:04:03-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:03):**  jerky is we don't dry it all the way.  We add a bunch of chemicals to it and preservatives.  So that way it's moist enough that our weak jawed modern consumers can eat it.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:17):**  Because if you make jerky at home and you get it all the way dry, you're in for a workout.  So it sounds like you've done that.  Yes, that sounds good.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:30):**  Because I was like, I made jerky once.  It was exactly what you just described.  And that makes sense.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:36):**  So I was like, it's nothing like the jerky you get that's, you know, in the discount  aisle or whatever.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:43):**  So now, now I know why mine's actually the more supreme product.  Yeah, yeah.  And so making something that you can actually eat, you know, because you imagine drying  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:04:54):**  with a big hunk.  Like if you took a whole roast and you wanted to dry it, you could, it would take a long  time.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:01):**  You might have to put holes in it to get the moisture for the middle out, but  Or slice it really, really thin.  Well, yeah, that would be  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:08):**  But it doesn't take all day.  Yeah.  If you slice it really thin, that would make it easy to eat.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:13):**  So then it'd be like chips.  But the problem is just, it's just eating it.  It's just like if you, if you make it too thick, and there's this reason why you do  
**[0:05:22-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:22):**  it besides time is that you can't bite down on it.  And it's like, you want it to be all the way dry if you want it to be shelf stable.  And so, hence the mortar and pestle is just basically like a stone bowl.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:37):**  And then a spasher and just, just  Yeah, just like that, then.  So you're just you're just really drying it out.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:05:50):**  Grinding it up kind of to a powder to, you know, a granular like, are you looking for  a specific granular size?  Yes, yeah, that that's taken a long time to get right.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:00):**  Okay, we're probably getting way into the weeds, and you don't have to say anything.  But then that's when you add the towel towel back, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:08):**  So the energy component, pioneers found out the hard way with rabbit starvation, that  you can't just eat protein.  So rabbit starvation is a phenomenon where they couldn't find big game, they were out  
**[0:06:22-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:22):**  like on the Oregon Trail, you know, trying to make a new life for themselves or come  from where there's too many people to where there's, there's opportunity.  And if they don't lose the big game, they lose that fat, you can't survive off of the  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:39):**  just the lean protein.  So you need either carbohydrate or fat.  So fat is included in animals.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:47):**  So if you if you're hunting animals, it's like it comes with fat, you have to go for  just the berries and grow fruit, fruit forest.  And that's a long term commitment.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:06:58):**  But if you're just hunting and you render the fat, then you can make a portion equal  to the fat shelf stable.  If you dry it out, and then mix it together, and actually help seal the protein even better  
**[0:07:09-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:09):**  with the lipids and the fat, they seal it from the oxygen.  Okay, that makes sense.  And they make it edible, you can bite into it.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:19):**  So it can be a bar, but you know, it's not going to break your teeth.  Right now, I've had them.  I actually backed you guys on Kickstarter, and you sent me a box.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:31):**  And I think it was just about a year ago.  I just went out to check the mail randomly.  And in the mailbox, there's another huge box of carnivore bars.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:41):**  I feel a little bit guilty that since you're on a show, I haven't had any sense.  They were good.  I'm gonna say I like them.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:50):**  But they're not.  They're not real high on my preference like that.  They taste good.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:07:58):**  But it's not like you're going to expect out of a meat product.  Do you want to talk a little bit about that?  About some of your taste and attention?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:05):**  Is that what you're saying, Brian?  You've never had one, have you, CK?  Oh, you guys need to send me some.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:14):**  I get no hug.  I'll send you both some of the new stuff.  So what we have now is much more.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:21):**  Yeah, so you ever reconstituted any of it?  Like this?  Do people do that?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:27):**  reconstitute?  What do you mean?  Like, I want to do it.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:31):**  Oh, no, no, I don't need to.  I have heard of people who melt it down and turn it as in like a physical like bone broth  or or like stroganoff.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:46):**  It's perfect.  Yeah, you don't.  If you don't particularly like it, you can always use it as a base.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:08:53):**  And you can make whatever you're eating a lot, a lot better for you with all those fat  soluble vitamins and all the amino acids that you need.  It's like, it is essentially a food by a soldier.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:06):**  So it's I had function in mind.  I went to Afghanistan and got terribly sick, because I was eating a bunch of preservatives.  And I was on antibiotics to prevent malaria.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:15):**  Now I'm grateful.  I don't have malaria.  I'm grateful I didn't die.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:21):**  But I kind of got dysbiosis.  So kind of wrecked me for the last decade.  dysbiosis?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:28):**  What What is that?  So you have a microbiome helps you digest your food.  And the microbiome is a lot of woo at this point, because humanity just isn't.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:40):**  We're just not sophisticated enough to know how all that works.  It's a complex relationship between your environment, the things you're eating, and the frequency  of your eating them.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:09:50):**  And then we don't know exactly which species are optimal for you.  We have a list.  And we're saying, well, these ones are probably good.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:01):**  But they work in synergy with a complex ecosystem that's changing every seven days.  And we're not exactly sure all the species that should.  And so what they do in medicine is they just take the poop from a healthy person and put  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:15):**  in the unhealthy person.  Sometimes they magically get better.  But that's hardly advanced science.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:21):**  That's that's a lot of guess and check.  It's talking about like, Trent trying to transplant the gut microbiome from one person.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:31):**  To room and diving stuff.  So yeah, it's the microbiome of the saliva, right?  I think Matt Cleffer said it.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:42):**  I think that was on 31 that we're all just big walking bags of microbes.  Like for some reason, we're this this giant bipedal walking bag of microbes that has developed  the ability to speak.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:10:54):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's a I got really sick eating preservative laden food.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:00):**  And so just to kind of wrap it back, because you asked about the texture of the taste.  And it is a pretty plain bar.  The reason it's plain is a lot of those preservatives mess with the microbiome.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:13):**  If that preservative is working outside the body, it also works inside the body, right?  Because they're they're durable chemicals.  And some of them are not very natural.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:23):**  So they're safe, but are they optimal?  And if you're sick, you want to you want to pull out of the stops, you want all the advantages  you have, you don't want any disadvantages.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:34):**  So when I got sick, I was looking at eating a cleaner diet.  And I pulled out everything but greens and meat.  And it basically didn't work.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:46):**  So something was still cut, pulled me back.  So I went on this weird, all meat diet, carnivore diet.  I know we met carnivore.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:11:52):**  Fine.  You give me big eyebrows.  When I said that to you, Brian,

**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:03):**  I'm not recommending it to anyone.  I'm not a health expert.  This is just what I did.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:10):**  It helps me.  But I couldn't take it on the go.  So I had this problem with making this healthy food that's basically everything you need,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:20):**  but nothing you don't.  And so a lot of people were used to this hyper palatable environment where everything tastes  like mouth explosion excitement.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:30):**  But a lot of that's done through really, really cheap chemicals.  So if you are,  yeah, yeah.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:36):**  So if I'm in that way,  sorry.  No, no, there's a little delay.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:42):**  Sorry, I didn't mean to talk over.  Okay, so like if you create a muffin, and you go to your kitchen, you get all like whole  ingredients like you make the best muffin you could possibly imagine.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:12:56):**  And then you then you want to, you know, you want to take it to the big time, you want  to mass produce it.  The very first thing the food scientists is going to say is like, how can we make it taste  
**[0:13:06-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:13:06):**  mostly like your muffin, but make it out of total crap.  So that we have a profit margin.  And it's like, there's a look at you like we want to want to find the cheapest thing  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:13:18):**  that tastes like 80% is good.  And so they'll they'll make them often for 15 cents.  Sell it for $1 and 15 cents.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:13:26):**  And then they have this awesome margin.  But it's like, so many people are doing that, that we just live in like this nutritive desert,  where there's nothing, there's nothing wholesome to eat.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:13:38):**  And certainly nothing wholesome that actually has any shelf life.  Because it's just too much trouble.  Right.  
**[0:13:45-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:13:45):**  And if it has a shelf life, that means it doesn't decay, which means it's been stabilized  by all sorts of preservatives and pasteurization processes.  And it's not, it's not a product that's going to be very highly bioavailable in any stretch  
**[0:14:00-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:14:00):**  of imagination, because it can't, it's not decaying.  Like it's decay is part of life, it is part of the cycle of life is decay.  If it's bioavailable, like if you your body could absorb it, then microbes could start  
**[0:14:14-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:14:14):**  breaking it down.  detritivores is what breaks down dead bodies.  It's like it is a whole class of different species, a whole cascade of species that start  
**[0:14:23-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:14:23):**  breaking down anything that dies in the wild.  So it's a conundrum is how do you make something shelf stable?  You know, with that in mind, it's like you really have to look to our past.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:14:34):**  And a lot of a lot of at least in the European tradition uses something called hermectins,  which is like salt curing, smoking, sugar cured ham, you know, all these traditional  spices like pepperoni, salami, charcuterie, like, there are these certain concoctions,  
**[0:14:54-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:14:54):**  they dry it, they age it, smoke it, and they add these substances that pull out all the  water like salt is the obvious one.  You know, have you ever heard of salted fish?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:15:05):**  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Salted fish, salted pork.  Salted cod.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:15:13):**  Yeah, huge, huge commodity back in the day.  It ran like, whole nations cared about, you know, the supply of salted cod.  It's like if you eat salted cod, I mean, it's not a pleasant experience.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:15:29):**  Hemican is 10 times more pleasant than salted fish.  It's drying in a way, it just can't explain it's, you know, and that's, that's what makes  it both bioavailable.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:15:41):**  But also preserved is there's got to be a catch.  And so the catch for the carnivore bar is, I mean, it's largely the cost.  It's very expensive to make pemmican, it's very labor intensive.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:15:53):**  And the parameters of success are such that there's a lot of you have to have a lot of  barriers to oxygen and moisture.  Right.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:04):**  So what they used to do is they used to put a rawhide bag full of pemmican, they make  little balls of it, pack it in, and then seal it with tallow on the top.  And then sew it together.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:16):**  So when you're ready to break into it, it's it's airtight.  It's sealed with the tallow.  Exactly.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:22):**  So that towel that's on the outside is oxidizing.  But just just so it's on top is oxidizing the pemmican underneath is sealed tight, because  they didn't have plastic.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:32):**  You know, that's a very, very modern.  So but this the principles remain true.  It's oxygen and moisture.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:40):**  There's always a catch if you want real food that's bioavailable, and therefore nourishing  to your body.  There's got to be a catch is either a hermectin, there's a physical barrier, there's something  
**[0:16:52-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:16:52):**  that keeps it that way.  Right.  And, you know, in your case, you've got to mix it with the towel to help provide that  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:00):**  protection.  You've got a really robust wrapper.  That's one of the things I noticed is, yeah, your wrapper is super robust.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:07):**  And it's almost like a mylar balloon.  It's Yeah, it really is.  And it's very expensive.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:16):**  But so it's a bare minimum, though, because if we've done this thing, right, um, it could  last pemmican rumored to last like 50 years.  So it's almost indefinitely shelf stable, or completely on shelf stable.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:33):**  It's just meat is complete, like maybe a week, or forever.  You were talking about your little muffins anecdote with the food science.  Yeah, that got me thinking about something Mike Calicrate said, you know, it wasn't animal  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:51):**  husbandry that put that pig in a crate.  It was animal science.  It was animal science that built that feedlot.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:17:58):**  It was animal science that built that chicken house, not animal husbandry.  And it's food science that tells us to make it as cheaply as possible so we can mass produce  it maximize or maximize our profits.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:18:12):**  I feel it's just kind of an interesting parallel that just popped into my head.  I'm struggling like, I mean, my my logo is a cave painting.  So you can kind of get where I'm going to line up on this, but I love science.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:18:26):**  But I think that there's a there's a hierarchy, and ancestral wisdom and principles have to  come first.  It's like science is to support ancestral wisdom, not to supplant it.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:18:41):**  I don't think that our mastery is sufficient to just ignore what all of our ancestors have  been doing for, you know, hundreds of thousands of years.  They knew what they were doing.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:18:54):**  I mean, they made us they had to be pretty smart to exist without having the the entire  sum of the world's knowledge available in the supercomputer you put in your pocket.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:19:07):**  And if you look at it from an anthropology point of view, in the last, you know, 10 to  12,000 years, the modern period modern history, it hasn't really been working out for us physically,  physically or mentally, like, or even fertility, like fertility rates are down.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:19:30):**  And our brain size is shrinking.  And you know, worse, we're shorter, we're smaller, we're weaker than we once were.  It's like, it might be that our, our understanding of agriculture and food, and our advanced  
**[0:19:46-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:19:46):**  science has kind of gotten into the territory of arrogance and hubris.  You've got personal experience with that with your time in the army and and getting ill,  get fine in the carnivore diet and getting better again.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:20:00):**  Let's, let's talk about that some more like, sure.  I know you lost like a ton of weight, like, well, it wasn't that much.  It was like 3040 pounds.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:20:11):**  Well, I mean, 40 pounds on a guy your size is a lot, Philip.  Thanks.  I'm not very tall.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:20:19):**  But no, I remember, you know, I went back through some of your social media.  You know, it seems like since you got on the carnivore diet, and start working on the carnivore  bar, that, you know, your health's improved.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:20:34):**  I remember from talking to you a couple years ago that, you know, you're got more mental  energy, more clarity or focus.  Yeah, talk about almost everything.  
**[0:20:46-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:20:46):**  So hunger, mood, resilience, like, people don't think about it as a performance metric,  but just like your ability to handle a curveball, your patience, like what's going to set you  off anxiety wise, like everything is just calmer.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:21:04):**  Like when I got off sugar, and that was the really big change for me when I wasn't doing  carbohydrates at all.  But the last the last leg for me was was vegetables for whatever reason.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:21:18):**  And people just are guessing like crazy online about what has made us weird like this, that  this diet helps us.  You know, autoimmune allergies, weird reactions to proteins and plants.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:21:37):**  But it really seems herbicide buildup from eating from eating it for decades.  I mean, I'll probably catch hell for saying that.  But I said it.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:21:46):**  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I won't I won't be asked.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:21:50):**  It's like, but for whatever reason, it worked.  And so I could think I'm clear headed, skinny shoes resolved, I lost a bunch of weight,  I feel really good.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:22:02):**  And I felt like ready to tackle this entrepreneurial dream that I had.  So you know, I would not have had the motivation, the perseverance and the mental acuity to  hang in there through all the different challenges that being a CEO has brought.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:22:19):**  So you know, I feel really lucky and blessed to have found something that works for me.  And you know, I wish everyone else the best of luck, whatever they you know, whatever  you're doing, I think you could look back to our ancestry and find something that's  
**[0:22:35-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:22:35):**  that will keep you healthy that works for you.  For sure.  So where do you source your where do you source your product from?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:22:47):**  Good question.  I am sourcing from Joyce Farms, primarily Joyce Farms in North Carolina.  So it's a Aberdeen Angus.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:22:56):**  Which I guess I've been told by competitors that that doesn't really mean anything all  Angus or Aberdeen.  But what what Joyce means by that is that they have found an older variant.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:23:12):**  So yeah, smaller structures, right?  Aberdeen cattle?  Yeah, it fattens really well on grass.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:23:21):**  Yeah.  Only grass, which is the whole point.  They're doing regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:23:28):**  And they found an older version, hundreds of years old that they are.  They're really, really trying to get that.  You know, that program and they're trying to grow.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:23:40):**  2020 was a little rough.  A lot of restaurants were closing for whatever reason.  And so they they specialized in the East Coast restaurants, the really important like the  
**[0:23:53-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:23:53):**  flavor.  So the version of the carnivore bar that you had 2019 was was really just a prototype.  It was, you know, a Hail Mary, like, I think I can do this.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:24:06):**  What I have now is like, crunchy, flaky, creamy.  Like it's, it's actually really good.  People off the street who don't, who don't care about impressing me actually say they  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:24:18):**  like it.  That was not true.  But first, that was not true.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:24:22):**  So there's been some growth.  You probably had to take a little bit of criticism in the in the early days for sure.  But it's the breed of the cattle that actually affords the flavor.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:24:35):**  Like whenever you dry something, you're concentrating that flavor.  And you know, jerky, if you dry it all the way, kind of, it kind of loses some of its  its flavor.  
**[0:24:45-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:24:45):**  But if you add the fat back in the pemmican, it's, it's full flavor like you're eating  steak.  So it's, if it's a really like, grass fed and really high omega three fish that's been  
**[0:25:03-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:25:03):**  kind of cultivated to promote high omega three, it tastes fishy.  And then you concentrate that flavor.  And it tastes exactly like you're thinking it tastes like a 3d old fish market that needs  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:25:18):**  a good scrub.  Like that's not anywhere near that sort of a product.  No.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:25:23):**  And so that you don't have plans to expand into fish.  No fish bars.  No.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:25:30):**  So, um, that the flavors and the all the different properties of the beef affect the flavor.  So it might be interesting science experiment to have that much omega three.  But I have to think that if it's oxidizing and smelling rancid like that, that those  
**[0:25:47-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:25:47):**  poof is really, they really aren't stable enough.  A poof is a polyunsaturated fatty acid.  And so beef, especially grass fed has lots of has steric acid, like 20% steric acid,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:26:01):**  but grain fed beef has no steric acid, but the majority is palmitic, like 40% palmitic  acid.  And that's the same.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:26:11):**  Okay, explain.  Can you explain this to me like I'm five?  I think I've already I've already started down with too many big words.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:26:20):**  So when you finish a cow, and I don't you guys are the experts here.  But the science or the theory behind what you guys do, ranchers is the finishing 180  days at the end.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:26:38):**  If you do grain, some people do corn, some people do crazy stuff like molasses or whatever.  Just putting on as much weight as possible.  They induce a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the cattle.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:26:54):**  And so that kind of blows out the liver.  But it's great for the intramuscular fat and marbling that makes the meat so tender and  and kind of mild, it makes the flavor more mild.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:27:06):**  And so I'm not gonna let you skip over that fact that you just said that feeding them  grain gives them liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is probably the  reason why we can't find beef liver in a supermarket anywhere.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:27:18):**  Well, it's nasty.  It's full of lesions.  It's gross.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:27:23):**  I would really recommend like the debate I serve both grass fed and grain fed bars.  I try not to pick sides, I may have to pick one eventually.  Because it's the converting back and forth is hard.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:27:39):**  But I try not to be dogmatic or ideological.  I just try to serve the need and stay out of the politics of it.  But it helps to be well versed in the science.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:27:53):**  And so the finishing on grass is hard because if you're paying by weight, and the cow is  getting fat on grass, well, it's an older animal, for one, like it takes a lot longer.  And so, you know, there's really no demarking before the finishing.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:28:15):**  It's all just grass from beginning then.  But the amount of care you have to take for the soil, and the rotation of that animal,  the increases the complexity, complexity astronomically, if you're trying to get a good yield from  
**[0:28:31-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:28:31):**  that cow, it needs to eat healthy grass and easy, thick, lush grass.  And you know, just a poundage that we as humans, it's like this is a salad from hell, it's  just never ending.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:28:43):**  It's like a dump truck full of salad.  Buckets and buckets of a salad.  They eat all day.  
**[0:28:47-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:28:47):**  They eat all day.  And so, you know, if you have a scraggly little patch of dirt with a couple of weeds in it,  that's not going to yield a fat cow on that kind of finishing program.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:03):**  Like you have to really, really take care of it.  Yeah, like your picture.  That's beautiful.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:09):**  You know, there's this beautiful amber waves of grass.  It's just amazing.  And Brian's picture there.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:19):**  You know, I, while you're looking at this picture, you know, I've always liked your  logo because it's got a horned cow on it.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:27):**  Horned cows matter.  Well, yeah, this is actually, do you see how the horns draw it?  In and up?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:34):**  Yeah.  It's modeled after it's a cave painting.  So it's not anthropomorphically correct, but it's an artist's rendition of an arc.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:46):**  Horns are hard to draw.  They're really, really hard to draw.  Well, no, it's done intentionally.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:29:51):**  The Auroch is the cave painting 50,000 years ago in the Skaou, France.  I'm probably mispronouncing that, but it's one of the oldest cave paintings of mankind  is of a cow.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:06):**  And this kind of cow that's now extinct.  Right.  And the Aurochs, like a lot of modern continental breeds are descended from the Auroch.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:15):**  And when did the Auroch go extinct?  It's been a thousand, 1500 years at least.  I think there was a, there was a close relative, something that was pretty close to an Auroch.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:27):**  Or maybe it's only 500 years.  Even a few hundred years ago.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:33):**  Well, history is not the, the near history is not what I'm looking at.  I'm looking at like our ancient history.  Cause the idea is that the original human diet, whatever it was, is maybe something  
**[0:30:45-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:45):**  that we're only getting slightly close to.  Like we may not be able to actually eat what our ancestors ate.  Cause all the vegetables and all the fruit that we've hybridized 10,000 years ago, didn't  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:30:58):**  exist.  Broccoli looked like a weed.  carrots were this big.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:05):**  You know, all our fruit was tiny.  Yeah.  We're working on trying to figure out how to grow that stuff because they got tired  
**[0:31:11-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:11):**  of chasing Aurochs around with spears.  Yeah.  And if they're not, you know, the wild ones are, are, are still fully intact and quite  
**[0:31:21-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:21):**  dangerous from what I hear.  Coyotes think twice going up to mess with a cow.  That's got, you know, two foot of spear on each side of their head.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:31):**  And wolves would think about the same thing.  Cause they were, they're way bigger than modern cows.  Yeah.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:38):**  And if it still has all its parts, it's hormonally whole, they can also be aggressive and scary.  There are, there are wild bulls in Australia that I've heard about that are like, kind  of get an idea of what it might've been like.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:31:54):**  It's like, Ooh, that's, that's kind of a different thing than our, our cows.  Because a water Buffalo in Africa can be really aggressive too.  I've seen videos of water Buffalo, like going in to save another water Buffalo, like to  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:32:10):**  chase off six lions.  Like that's brave.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:32:15):**  They're, they're an intense and incredible animal.  It's like, we, we kind of take them for granted a little bit with their domestication and  you know, all our ways of keeping it safe and calm and nice.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:32:26):**  It's like, we kind of forget like how intense it must've been in the wild.  And so, I mean, that was, that's kind of a, the idea with the cave painting is to go back.  But also with my supplier and Joyce, it it's finding that ancestral, like the ratio of  
**[0:32:45-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:32:45):**  like the protein, the fat, the amino acids, the high quality soils, which lead to high  quality meat because of the minerals and the vitamins that are in the soil affect the minerals  and vitamins that are in the cow.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:32:59):**  And so, you know, it's this holistic way of looking.  It's like, maybe we don't know everything about what we should be eating.  Cause what we seem to be eating as modern people seems to be making us sick.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:11):**  It seems like the flashier, the package and the brighter, the claims, the worst that crap  is for you.  Like if the, if the ingredients are the label is more than maybe three lines long, maybe  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:26):**  you should put that back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:29):**  What, so what are the ingredients in the carnivore bar?  Like what, what's the, what's the longest label you've got longest ingredients line  you've got beef, tallow salt.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:39):**  Didn't you have one with honey?  That's one that we're not going to continue.  Probably.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:45):**  It's a limited release with honey, but I can send you some.  Before they were out.  I had one.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:52):**  I think I had one.  Did you?  The box you sent the, like the box you sent me last year.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:33:58):**  I think I had, I think there was a couple of honeys in there.  I remember, I remember seeing the honey bee sticker on, on a bar last year.  So January, February, maybe.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:09):**  I guess it was earlier this year.  Yeah.  It was this year.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:12):**  Yeah.  They're kind of blurring together.  It's March 22.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:18):**  It's like pandemic everything.  Post-corona is just the calendar is almost irrelevant.  It's a two year, one year period.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:27):**  Right?  It's the long, it's the longest two weeks in history.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:34):**  So not doing honey anymore.  You've got a grass fed variety, green fed variety.  I might do it.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:40):**  I might do it.  I might do it.  It's one of those things where, you know, how many flavors could you make?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:48):**  It's like thousands.  It's like, what, what would sell, what would be, what would be on brand?  Oh, you want a teriyaki flavor.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:34:56):**  You want a spicy sweet flavor.  You want a flame and hot flavor.  You want a barbecue flavor.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:35:04):**  Right now, right now we're four people.  So the carnivore bar is four people and we're doing everything.  So we're, you know, we just sold out.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:35:15):**  Like, I mean, we've been almost perpetually sold out all, all summer and fall.  So as much as you can make and not, not being able to keep inventory, we literally two weeks,  we just, we just stopped taking, stopped taking orders for any price.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:35:31):**  And then, then we had to increase our, our prices just so we can keep up with the Kickstarter  because we did a Kickstarter like to see if people wanted us to do a honey bar.  And so we did Kickstarter one and at the grass fed exchange and launched with the carnivore  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:35:50):**  con.  And so all the people who eat this special way I was like, well, Hey, you want to make  it?  
**[0:35:57-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:35:57):**  And they said, sure, go ahead and give it your best shot.  And so I did.  And you know, I was meeting different people at the grass exchange actually met Ron Joyce  
**[0:36:07-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:07):**  there.  And that's where I got that idea.  We're actually talking about the Berkshire pig that you see from extinction.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:18):**  There was this breed of pig that was really good on, on in regenerative practice.  And it tastes apparently really, really good.  I've yet to have one, but it's that genetics conversation that he was having a lobby with  
**[0:36:32-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:32):**  somebody else.  So probably somebody really important.  I shouldn't have been buttoned in, but I couldn't help myself.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:40):**  I was fascinated.  And I asked him about it and you know, I was wearing this, the shirt with this, this orac  on it.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:47):**  And I was like, yeah, genetics is kind of my jam.  Like trying to go for this ancestral thing.  And he's like, well, Hey, you know, I'll send you some samples.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:36:54):**  You can make it out of a Joyce Farm's me.  And I was like, sure, let's do it.  Right on.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:00):**  How many missed opportunities have we had in this two week in this longest two weeks  ever of, of not having conference seasons to make those connections?  Yeah.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:09):**  And you know, we met there too.  So it's just like, you never know who you're going to bump into.  And I was, I was doing a little filming for a friend.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:18):**  Yeah.  That's why you're, that's actually why your grass fed exchange, what it, you were there  to actually film.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:24):**  So my ticket was to film.  Yeah.  So my buddy was doing the filming and so he needed a assistant because there were two  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:32):**  different tours, one to a dairy farm, one to, right.  Sonoma.  Yeah.

**[0:37:42-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:42):**  And then there was the simple Creek ranch and Sonoma mountain Institute tour.  And that's, we went on the mountain and simple Creek tour together.  Yeah.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:51):**  This, the simple Creek was just absolutely unbelievable though.  The rolling Hills.  And it was just really, really cool.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:37:59):**  I've actually been talking to Lauren Pancha.  I'm going to get him on the show.  I was just texting with him the other day.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:05):**  He's he's off on a trip right now.  Won't be back till next week, but we're going to get Pancha on the show to talk about all  the cool stuff he's got going on on simple Creek ranch.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:14):**  He's a great guy and he's really, really passionate about it.  You can really just tell his energy.  I really enjoyed his presentation and I really enjoyed seeing his cattle and his beautiful  
**[0:38:25-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:25):**  ranch.  From what I understand, like just after we left, it quit raining.  It didn't look very good.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:34):**  And it really hasn't looked that good ever since.  Ah, it was, it was a drizzle.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:41):**  But it was really, really lush and wet.  When we were there, I was trying to keep my camera dry.  I was like, Oh no.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:47):**  Yeah.  I got, I, then that was the start of the day and I wore my good boots and they were the  only boots that I had.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:38:54):**  It was like nine hours before we got back before I got back to the hotel and got dry  shoes and socks.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah.  I remember that day.  Great tour.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:07):**  Great tourist simple Creek though.  Yeah.  So, uh, yeah, you were, you were doing some filming and I, I, I snooped your LinkedIn  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:13):**  profile.  I noticed you have a BA in theater.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:17):**  That was before the army.  Correct.  So you want to talk about that a little bit?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:24):**  I'm curious how you went from getting like a bachelor's in theater and doing some fight  directoring to joining the army.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:35):**  So I did stunts.  I really liked keeping people safe and, um, I graduated in 2009.  So the financial crisis happened, uh, my senior year and I graduated with a bachelor of arts  
**[0:39:53-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:39:53):**  in theater in stage combat, uh, with zero experience.  And so naturally I became a ditch digger.  And uh, I was digging drainage ditches.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:40:12):**  With a very expensive liberal arts degree.  I was going to say, it's kind of like, you know, that's the joke.  What is the liberal arts major ask at work?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:40:21):**  You want fries with that?  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:40:24):**  And that was me, but you know, there were masters students, uh, asking if you wanted  fries with that.  There were doctorate students, uh, doing the it's like, Oh, so there was a hierarchy.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:40:37):**  So I'm, I'm in the ditch.  So it was one of those things where I was like, man, I need to find a, I need to find  like a way to support myself, um, and a journey of which I'm, I'm still searching for to this  
**[0:40:53-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:40:53):**  day.  Uh, but it was my discovery of the human body and health and how little I knew about the  human body.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:03):**  And I was telling people to, you know, here, pick up this weapon and pretend to fight,  but you know, send your cast, your energy past them, your meaning, but don't send it  into them.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:14):**  You know, you're, you're, you're doing this, like, it's not really a martial art.  It's more like a magic trick where you're like, Oh wow, I missed it.  It's like, what happened?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:27):**  Oh, and then they're acting hurt.  Oh, they must've gotten hurt.  It's like, that's a lot of stage combat, especially in theater where you make a noise, a pop,  
**[0:41:35-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:35):**  everyone acts.  And then a story emerges, which is, has to be a balsa because you're going to do it again  tomorrow night.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:43):**  Right.  So you can't actually hurt or bruise or bludgeon the faces of your lead actors because they  have to appear in the next scene, unbludgeoned and bruise.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:41:54):**  So keeping people safe was kind of the theme.  So financial crashes happened.  Uh, there were no internships or jobs in theater, unless you were willing to work for free and  
**[0:42:06-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:42:06):**  free was not then what my landlord was charging me for rent.  So I went and did a job that I could learn about the human body and that would give me  real world experience.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:42:18):**  So I became a combat medic.  So I keep people safe, which was thematically on, you know, vibe with my personality.  And then I could get money to go to college, get an advanced degree.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:42:31):**  I was thinking about physical therapy as a day job, you know, cause it would enhance  my coaching clients or actors in this fun, fun thing I like to do.  I'm doubtful that I'd ever pay, but fun.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:42:47):**  So I have this real world experience as a combat medic.  And then my health, just as I'm figuring out about the human body, just as I'm trying to  get my feet on the ground, like get started in life.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:42:59):**  My health just takes a nose dive.  And I spend the next decade trying to figure out what the heck went wrong.  And I learned a lot of different things about paleo, keto, all these different food strategies,  
**[0:43:13-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:43:13):**  all these different environmental toxins that you can do, but there's so many different  rabbit holes, like rabbit trails, like it just felt like there's, it's a treacherous  field when you're trying to discern what happened to your health.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:43:31):**  There's so many different vectors that your health can be derailed, especially in America.  It's one of the...  And it's so hard to know what to believe.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:43:39):**  It's so hard to know who to trust and who to listen to, especially now about, you know,  things like nutrition and, you know, trust the science.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:43:50):**  What science?  Go ahead.  No, there's science for everything.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:43:53):**  It contradicts itself.  Well, just like we were talking about earlier, you know, trust the science, trust the science.  You know, that's the line that the educated people like to throw out.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:05):**  Just trust the science.  We need to do this.  Just trust the science.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:08):**  Well, we trusted the science with ivermectin in cattle that destroyed our dung beetles.  We figured that out.  You know, what else have we trusted the science with?  
**[0:44:18-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:18):**  You know, we trust animal science to put cows in heifos and pigs in barns and chickens in  giant sheds.  Maybe we should start looking at these science-based systems with a little bit more distrust and  
**[0:44:32-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:32):**  a little bit more criticism.  Yeah.  And I don't think there's inherently anything wrong with science.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:41):**  But I think that, you know, to borrow some religious language, I think that it's a real  mistake to make it your idol, to make science the idol.  It's like, whatever keeps the animal alive and gets more cash, bigger yield, bigger,  
**[0:44:56-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:44:56):**  better, faster.  It's like, I think that's the wrong metric of success.  It needs to be health, happiness, having a future, being resilient, kind of more of a  
**[0:45:10-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:45:10):**  holistic, you know, I don't want to just be alive for today.  I would like to, you know, tomorrow sounds cool, too.  Like maybe I could even do several years, stretch them together.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:45:21):**  Like maybe I could live a healthy, long, happy life that isn't just over next week because  I want to do all the drugs and just burn through my adrenal system until I'm just crashing  into a brick wall.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:45:37):**  It's like, which is what we often do to like the accelerants and animal science.  It's like, we're just trying to get a bigger yield.  We're just trying to get more money.  
**[0:45:47-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:45:47):**  It's like, okay, well, a lot of that's water.  You know, when I cook, I cook both grass fed, grass finished, and I cook grain.  I get way more yield, way more weight from the dried grass fed, grass finished beef.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:04):**  It's like, there's actually more protein in it.  Do you think that's because they're adding water in the processing, in the packing plant,  or that's just water that's in the fat and in the muscle because of the grain diet?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:18):**  It's in the muscle because those muscles aren't really hot.  The muscles are bloated with water.  Is we noticed that same exact thing with chicken.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:30):**  I hate to say, I hate to admit it, but we did buy some chicken from Walmart.  No, it wasn't chicken.  It was we bought some 85, 15.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:40):**  That was like a, it was like a two and a half pound package, 85, 15 ground beef from the  store.  Mm-hmm.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:46):**  Ground that up, drained it, weighed it.  It lost almost a pound.  And you throw two pounds of any of the grass fed, grass finished stuff that we buy for  
**[0:46:59-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:46:59):**  many of our friends, you brown up two pounds of that and you've got two pounds of meat.  You don't lose, you're not losing 30% of it.  Or like one eight seven, you might lose like less than 10% or a little bit more.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:47:14):**  It's like, it's very small.  It's fascinating.  And so the yields, when you start to scale up, they really make a difference.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:47:23):**  So I thought I would have a big difference in cost for my grass and grain.  And that's what all the people who grass fed spilly, you know, that's, that's silly.  Panda massage, luxury deluxe, you know, salesmanship.  
**[0:47:41-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:47:41):**  I was like, not really though, because the yield is, is such that once you dispense with  the water, it's not actually that much cheaper, you know, per, per pound of dry, you know,  and it's like, but it also has no steric acid whatsoever.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:00):**  And steric acid is the fat that people are really excited about that helps you lose weight.  It's supposed to be cardio protective.  It's supposed to be really good for you.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:10):**  It only exists in grass fed grass finished.  And it's still a small amount.  It's not a huge amount, but it's a lot and cocoa butter.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:19):**  The reason they think that chocolate might be good for your health is steric acid.  And it probably has like what a 10th of a percent as much as beef does by weight.  Well that's where it gets ironic.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:31):**  It's actually 60% steric acid.  So it is about three times more steric acid per ounce.  It doesn't have any retinol.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:42):**  It doesn't have any the fat soluble vitamins in animal fat.  So you're, you're getting a more beneficial, like weight loss effect, potentially depending  on which philosophy you ascribe to.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:48:56):**  And these are all theories that are not advice, but the steric acid is one of those metrics  that people hunt for.  And so that goes away.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:49:06):**  The omega-3 is completely gone, but even in grass fed cattle, the omega-3 is pretty small.  Like it's pretty scant.  It's hard to know how much omega-3 you really need because the debate is raging.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:49:24):**  It's like, well, it seems like ancestrally we would eat fresh fish.  Like fish was really easy to catch for humans.  We all ate fresh fish and other stuff, lots of debate on the other stuff.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:49:42):**  They can, they've gone, they can go back and look and, and figure out what a lot of people's  ate, but there wasn't a lot of, you know, heavy processed grains and sugars and stuff.  Well, yeah.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:49:55):**  And if they ate any vegetables they don't keep.  They also ferment them.  So then we get into the microbiome conversation again.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:50:08):**  It's like, well, so we have all these clay pots and these ancient civilizations and they're  breaking stuff down and then they're testing the residue and they're like, huh, what was  in this?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:50:19):**  And there's almost always, everything was fermented, whether it was yogurt, whether  it was sauerkraut, whether it was, they made this like goza, this like citrus beer thing.  It was barely a beer.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:50:33):**  It was mostly like slightly citrusy water, but that killed all the bacteria.  So you know, fermentation is just a slow, like you're just, you're, I guess you're letting  it rot.  
**[0:50:49-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:50:49):**  You're letting it kind of, you know, decay on purpose to a point and then stopping it.  Well, you're also controlling the environment.  So when you do fermentation, it's not just rotting.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:51:02):**  It's not just, you know, let nature have it.  It is a controlled environment.  So for example, when I made sauerkraut, when I was in that part of my journey, I was looking  
**[0:51:14-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:51:14):**  for I think plantaris, certain kind of bacteria that is supposed to help you with dysbiosis.  So I was like, I researched it, found this species.  It's really, really prevalent in sauerkraut.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:51:28):**  And so then you have to get the salt concentration correct.  You have to get it absolutely sterile clean.  So no contaminants, no fungus, because you want bacteria.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:51:39):**  You don't want the fungus.  So the level of clean you have to be is, it's pretty hardcore.  It was a good roundup, you know, warm up round for the carnivore bar because everything in  
**[0:51:50-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:51:50):**  the carnivore bar is really hard too.  So sauerkraut, I did like I did a water seal around and then you had to salt that inappropriately  hot.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:01):**  So there's really salty water in the top.  And so microbes that fall in, they can't get through the water.  And it's not good for microbial growth.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:10):**  But then I you measure out the salt perfectly.  So it breaks down the cellulose in the in the cabbage.  And so the bacteria can get at it.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:20):**  And when the bacteria get at it, then there's like seven different species.  And they they peak, they crest and then the other one peaks and then the next one peaks  and the next one peaks and the next one peaks.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:33):**  And the first three aren't very good for you.  But they're not toxic, then it starts to get unhealthy.  Then another one comes and replaces and eats the metabolites of that one.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:44):**  And that one's the one you want.  And it's like, well, then it's ready.  And your grandma would have just tasted it and known just just known.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:52:54):**  And it's like, how do you know?  It's like we can we can graph it, we can spread chart it, we can do all this stuff.  It's like the same kind of knowledge is lost with sourdough.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:53:10):**  That's where magic wands come from.  Magic wands were the starter stick, the stirring stick that had the microbes that started off  the culture correctly.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:53:21):**  Is that's that's interesting.  I've never heard that before.  Sorcery.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:53:26):**  No, microbiome, my microbiology.  Interesting way of thinking about the concept of magic.  I like it.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:53:35):**  Yeah.  Well, it's divine, but not in the way you think it's it's it's how it was designed by  nature.  
**[0:53:44-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:53:44):**  I remember hearing stories that mankind invented beer because we needed a way to store some  of the nutritional value of grain.  So it wouldn't spoil.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:00):**  So we learned to make beer.  Maybe.  So it also makes it depending on the grain you use and depending on when you harvest  
**[0:54:08-0:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:08):**  it, it could also make it easier to digest, you know, because when the microbes get at  it, if you get at it at the right time, it it makes the their metabolites are more bioavailable.  It starts the fermentation process.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:24):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so then that it crests, it peaks, you know, they talk about wines peaking all the  
**[0:54:32-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:32):**  time.  It's like it reaches a certain state and then it's maximally nutritious.  But then that state starts to degrade over time.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:41):**  So, you know, for every ferment, there is a peak and ancestral people would have known  how to time that so that their food kept and they had a window where, you know, we might  have to wait for a month, but, you know, days twenty seven to thirty four, the best time  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:54:58):**  to eat it.  And they know it's going to be really good.  Yeah, this can be great on that.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:55:03):**  And then they're waiting and they're anticipating and they crack it open.  And then, you know, I can only imagine that it'd be exciting.  It's almost hard to imagine a world without avocados in February.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:55:19):**  That world existed just a just a couple of decades ago.  Well, if the supply chain shortages continue, we will not have to imagine.  Is your.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:55:31):**  I think people are getting back to eating seasonally instead of conveniently, you know,  just because the strawberries now doesn't mean that you should buy them.  Yeah, well, it's also and there's been lots and lots of weird shortages.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:55:51):**  People are just kind of cluing in it.  I think the and a lot of movements, you know, with ancestral traditions and eating and homesteading  and kind of being more self-sufficient, a lot of that's popping up on people's radar.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:56:07):**  And that's really encouraging.  At least I hope it is.  I'm not even going to ask you a dumb question like, did you plant a garden for or are you  
**[0:56:15-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:56:15):**  going to plant a garden for next year because you're a carnivore diet guy?  So we'll skip right over that one.  But like, yeah, is your supply chain pretty solid?  
**[0:56:29-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:56:29):**  I don't know.  You know, it really depends on these rappers like we have some deals in the works that  if we if it goes our way.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:56:38):**  Yeah, we're great.  But the world is a treacherous place for small businesses.  And I'm glad it looks like we're doing awesome on social media.  
**[0:56:48-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:56:48):**  But it's it's a rough business.  If you want to buck the system and you want to sell something that's actually quality  and you don't want to gouge anybody and you want to pay your employees living wage, it's  
**[0:57:00-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:57:00):**  like we're kind of picking multiple fights with the system all at the same time.  So I thought that was going to be a softball question for you because, you know, you have  three ingredients on your label, but then you have your rapper and that rapper.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:57:17):**  Probably a sticking point.  If you make it out of just cheap plastic, oxygen and moisture go right through the rapper.  And if you.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:57:28):**  If you make it out of the wrong kind of form, you know, not all of them are food safe and  half of them in their food safe, leech harmful like BPA and plastic into the food.  Well, for our ancestrally minded people, that is completely unacceptable.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:57:45):**  And rawhide bags is completely unacceptable to the health department, the USDA.  So it's like, well, you know, we got to.  So we have a narrow kind of window.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:57:55):**  We can't have anything that's going to leech into the food because that's gross.  And that happens all the time with granola bars.  We eat a bunch of cheap food that, you know, we put in containers, you know, the Gatorade  
**[0:58:10-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:10):**  bottles, the one that I, I always hated is like, well, I used to play soccer when I was  a kid and they'd give us Gatorade.  And sometimes the Gatorade would sit out and bake in the sun and you can taste the plastic.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:22):**  It's like gross.  It's like at a kid, I didn't care that it was unhealthy for me.  I just didn't want to taste gross plastic.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:30):**  I went in my blue drink to be blue.  Yeah.  It has so much sugar in it that I mean, how could you paste the plastic and it under all  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:39):**  the sugar?  Yeah.  Well, if you get it hot enough, it's that it's that pet.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:44):**  It's the number one type of plastic.  It's very, it's not heat stable.  And if you reuse it over and over, it wears, it creates these little micro tears, but there's  
**[0:58:55-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:58:55):**  a plastic that goes into the drink.  We also had them in Afghanistan and they were great.  Well, I don't know if I want to go there, but they're great for eliminating, eliminating  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:09):**  waste products.  Heck yeah.  You don't need to say anything more.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:13):**  Did you guys have camelbacks over there?  Yes.  I had one of those too.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:17):**  Did it ever taste right?  Yeah.  After after several gallons, several, several gallons, several different patrols, it tasted  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:27):**  right for a few weeks.  And then then it got moldy.  And I think I just throw it away because I couldn't, I could never get it clean once  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:35):**  the mold sets in.  It just, it's gross.  Yeah.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:39):**  There's little tubes.  I kind of had the same problem too.  Like you use it, you use it, you use it, and then it just starts to be acceptable one day  
**[0:59:47-0:59:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:47):**  and you quit tasting all the plastic.  And then about two months later, the tube goes black and it's like, Oh crap, maybe I,  maybe I shouldn't be drinking out of this anymore.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:56):**  Yep.  That's my experience.  Exactly.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=0:59:59):**  Oh, so what other than wrappers and supply chains, what's a, what's the biggest challenge  you guys are facing?  So we live in uncertain times and people are a little hesitant to invest in something that  
**[1:00:18-1:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:00:18):**  they see as risky.  And so I have a conundrum with how I pitch the carnivore bar.  It's like on one aspect, it's just a healthy food, but in another, it's also everything  
**[1:00:33-1:00:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:00:33):**  you need to survive that shelf stable for 25, 30 years and everything that you need  to survive.  So if humanity collectively had say like a bad day and you wanted to survive and the  
**[1:00:48-1:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:00:48):**  power went out, your deep freeze went out.  It's like, you're either a rancher or you're involuntary, you know, vegan.  So we have this horrible vulnerability, but we can't store shelf stable food that doesn't  
**[1:01:03-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:01:03):**  make you sick.  And in an event of an emergency there's not going to be modern healthcare.  So we're all like hyper sick and the carnivores are a hyper vulnerable population in a hyper  
**[1:01:18-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:01:18):**  vulnerable place.  Given that our supply chains are so fragile and we don't really have a lot of alternatives,  especially as carnivores.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:01:28):**  It's, it's one of those things that last April people were like, bang it down my door for  these things like whole Bitcoins thousand.  I want a thousand bars, get them to me like this week possibly.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:01:43):**  And I had to just say no, because at a certain point it's so finicky to make this product  that you cannot, I can't make any more for any price, any price whatsoever, because it's  literally ingredients for life.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:01:59):**  If there's a problem, all of those like ready-made shelf stable bucket bag, tote things, I like  60% carbs and have very, very poor vitamins and minerals.  So they have almost no nutrition and they're just empty calories.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:02:19):**  Well, if you're already edging on the, on the border of sick, like you're not going  to do well on that.  And really it's not about how it tastes.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:02:30):**  It's about how you feel.  Cause you know, when we were soldiers in Afghanistan, like we felt terrible.  We MREs and preserve food every day of the year, because some people rotated back to  
**[1:02:44-1:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:02:44):**  the base.  Other people got farmed out to these tiny little bases where all you had are MREs or  something called the UGR, which is like a shared crappy group MRE, which is horrible  
**[1:02:58-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:02:58):**  and MRE, but worse MRE, but worse and bigger.  So without the candy.  So it's just, you know, you have those kinds of vulnerable situations and the uncertain  
**[1:03:11-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:03:11):**  times we live in, it's, it's hard to know like how to sell this product responsibly.  Cause I hate, I hate the media and the fear-mongering and the hyperbole and silliness, but we as  a species do not have healthy food that's shelf stable.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:03:33):**  And that is a human problem, not a country problem, not an individual community problem,  but all humans.  So that's what I'm trying to solve, but I don't want to be like pushy or weird about  
**[1:03:50-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:03:50):**  it.  It's like, this is just my thing because of the circumstances I found myself in Afghanistan.  So, you know, to each their own, but your garden question made me think of this 2020,  
**[1:04:02-1:04:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:04:02):**  I actually bought heirloom seeds.  Not for me, but to trade, you know, people just don't understand that you go to a grocery  store, the seed terminates.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:04:18):**  There's no future for it.  Because Monsanto were, oh yeah, genetics.  And then it doesn't create more seeds.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:04:25):**  So you, you grow your, your garden, you grow your tomato, and then you don't have any seeds  for the next year and you're done.  So you need heirloom seeds to, to further.

**[1:04:52-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:04:52):**  Not everyone keeps a herd big enough that if they bred could be stable long-term, like  20, 30 years.  Because if, if something were to happen, you may not be able to get, you know, a bull to  
**[1:05:10-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:05:10):**  get that you needed to bring in another genetic.  Yeah.  And so there's this, this crazy thing where everything is just taken for granted in our  
**[1:05:21-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:05:21):**  society.  Everything is, is hyper efficient, extremely profitable and hyper fragile.  And so I don't like having too extreme of an opinion about that is so distasteful to  
**[1:05:35-1:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:05:35):**  me and being disrespectful of other ways of living and other, you know, opinions and being  stressed all the time is just really unhealthy.  So struggling with that kind of knowledge floating around my head has been the biggest  
**[1:05:51-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:05:51):**  problem because we need investment now decades before there is an emergency.  If we have an emergency and then get support, you know, I can make a million dollars selling  a single bar, but that's, that's not what I want and won't help me make more bars.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:06:13):**  It won't help me help people.  And that's been kind of the theme of what I'm trying to do is like, I would like to  be helpful.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:06:19):**  And if I'm hyperbolic or crazy, like, Oh, like, I don't think that's helpful.  Not in this, this environment we're in.  There's a lot of hyperbole on social media and it's tough not to get sucked into a lot  
**[1:06:34-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:06:34):**  of it.  I just hate it.  It's so gross.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:06:37):**  I just try to, I try to, I try to let myself be lifted by all the positivity and ignore  the negativity, especially the haters.  And you know, I don't mind the haters because, and I think I've said this on the podcast  
**[1:06:51-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:06:51):**  before.  I don't mind haters because they're this close to being your biggest fan.  You already get to live in their head rent free and they pay attention to everything  
**[1:07:03-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:03):**  you do.  True.  So I don't mind haters.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:08):**  Bring it on.  That's that's fine.  If you're going to start over, what's the best advice you wish you had on day one with  
**[1:07:18-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:18):**  the carnivore bar?  Like if I'm giving it to someone else or someone giving it to me.  If you were doing it over again and you were giving yourself advice on how to start over.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:33):**  I was afraid you might ask this question or something like this.  I think I might say, don't do it.  That's interesting.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:44):**  Why would you say that?  It's just been like a horrible white knuckle ride.  That's actually taken a lot from my health.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:07:57):**  Like when I found the carnivore movement, I was at the top.  I was at the peak, but running a business, running a small business and trying to buck  all these different systems, treat my employees with respect, make a profit, but not at the  
**[1:08:13-1:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:08:13):**  expense to my customer and not at the expense of my supplier.  Trying to run an ethical company that is doing something regenerative, but also not an ideology  or kind of dogmatic or tyrannical.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:08:29):**  It's one of those, you have all these intersecting accesses of challenge and like the most heroic  thing you can do, which is how I was raised is all of them.  I think I might've spent more time getting my feet on the ground and self-development  
**[1:08:49-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:08:49):**  before I attempted something so difficult.  I think I wasn't optimally ready if I'm being honest.  I think there's something to that.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:09:02):**  If you wait until you're ready, you'll never be ready.  That's true.  That's true.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:09:08):**  But we effectively launched March, 2020.  And perfect time to launch a product.  And then by April, we were sold out forever and then by October we were forgot about.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:09:25):**  And so it was just like, when they want this product, they want it now and they want it  by the truck lot.  And when they're not thinking about it, they're like, oh, it's a little plain.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:09:41):**  Texture's a little, you know.  But it's gotten so much better and I'm happy about the place I'm in now.  And I'm glad I took this journey, but I think my ethical advice would be to not do it for  
**[1:09:58-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:09:58):**  where I was in 2019.  But all things said and done, it has been an incredible journey.  I have learned a lot.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:10:06):**  I've grown a lot.  And I think we have a product finally now that's ready for people who aren't food carnivore  zealots to try.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:10:18):**  Because it really is just an incredibly different product now than for where it was when you  tried it.  I'll have to get some more.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:10:29):**  I'll send you some.  Awesome.  I'm looking forward to it.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:10:34):**  You want to talk about fake meat?  It might be a short conversation.  It's a funny story.  
**[1:10:42-1:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:10:42):**  It actually originated in Columbia, Missouri, exactly where I am.  Beyond meat, well, that's one of the company, was I think the Missouri innovation center,  center for innovation or whatever.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:00):**  They have a bunch of scientists and amazing scientific equipment.  And they worked with beyond me to bring it to market.  And it IPO'd for $3.8 billion.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:16):**  So same town, I talked to the same people.  The investors passed.  None of their food scientists helped me.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:28):**  I didn't even get called back.  And I raised $84,000.  And the regulation for beyond meat is minimal.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:42):**  You know, all of the hassle they go to is to protecting their IP.  Because it's not me.  It's manufactured from chemical bullshit.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:50):**  So a meat product, they can't even call it.  They shouldn't even legally be allowed to call it meat.  It's profoundly unhealthy.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:11:58):**  All the ingredients were chosen to mimic the taste and feel of meat.  But they are not nutritionally comparable at all.  And a lot of the stuff they've chosen were very, very inflammatory.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:12:09):**  But they were chosen because the texture, the way it sizzles or the color of redness.  It's like, it's a lot of effort.  But it's not any nutrition.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:12:22):**  It's like you'd be much better off.  Just go into your own garden, you know, controlling the soil, create good soil, eat healthy vegetables.  Like don't eat these like these vegetable products that have been condensed and processed  
**[1:12:38-1:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:12:38):**  and turned into this unnatural ratio.  Because it's those ratios too.  It's like when you eat a vegetable, you're getting the fiber.  
**[1:12:46-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:12:46):**  So you're cultivating the bacteria that eats fiber that helps you break it down.  There's a strong case that if you eat vegetables, you should grow your own and should eat high  quality vegetables that you routinely eat so that your body knows how to break that  
**[1:13:04-1:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:13:04):**  down.  There's no surprises.  You're not throwing it for a loop every few steps.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:13:10):**  But beyond meat is right in my backyard.  I was literally across from the place.  Maybe like it was down the street a little bit and then across the street of where I  
**[1:13:23-1:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:13:23):**  started the Carnivore Bar.  And it was just surreal to see how much investing attention goes to the fake meat versus bringing  real meat and making it shelf stable and trying to deliver the highest quality possible nutrition  
**[1:13:40-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:13:40):**  that anyone's ever attempted to do.  All those guys that you went to ask for funding and the scientists you went to ask for help.  As soon as they hear you're trying to make an all meat product, I imagine all they're  
**[1:13:55-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:13:55):**  thinking is cows are bad.  We're killing the rainforest to grow more cows.  Animal agriculture is horrible.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:14:02):**  Yeah.  And the lies from Cowspiracy that have been debunked hundreds of times.  It's like, you know, you can tell they don't know anything about animal agriculture when  
**[1:14:14-1:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:14:14):**  they say that it's cow hearts.  It's like the relevant literature.  It's a burp, you know, and it's a burp because they are fermenting cellulose, which creates  
**[1:14:29-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:14:29):**  methanotrophs and that methane doesn't persist in the environment and that methanotrophs  fix the nitrogen that create rich soils.  So it's like this system was designed, you know, by nature, by God or however you you  
**[1:14:45-1:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:14:45):**  feel it was here.  It was designed to work a certain way.  When we pave over the prairies with suburbs, it's not working like it was designed to work.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:14:56):**  It's you know, and we need to we need to graze, graze our topsoil if we want to keep our topsoil.  And preferably rotate it and rest it because there's also some of that going on.  That's just not very well taken care of cattle.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:15):**  And that kind of gives everyone a bad day.  That line that we've got to graze our topsoil to keep our topsoil that that's that's very  well put in, you know, and that's the first time we've heard anybody say that I think  
**[1:15:29-1:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:29):**  in like 42, 42 episodes.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:34):**  Yeah, we've you know, we've had farmers, aren't we?  We had Michael Thompson on here.  He's one of the best farmers I know.  
**[1:15:40-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:40):**  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  So that's, I like that.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:43):**  That's cool.  Philip, thank you.  Well, thank you for having me on.  
**[1:15:49-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:49):**  We're not kicking you off.  Yeah.  No, we're not kicking you off.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:15:52):**  Yeah.  I mean, I've kind of kind of getting down to the thin end of my my question deck here  though.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:01):**  Ask away, I'm enjoying talking to you.  Okay, well, here's a good one.  Like, and we got to go deep for this one.  
**[1:16:09-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:09):**  Okay, you could invite over any three people alive or dead.  dinner.  Who would it be and why?  
**[1:16:21-1:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:21):**  That's a great one.  You asked for a good one.  I think.  
**[1:16:27-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:27):**  Hmm, so you got to kind of think about like, who do you want to talk to?  And then how are they going to talk to each other?  So that's a complicated question.  
**[1:16:37-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:37):**  Because it's not just like, who do you want to talk to most?  It's what what conversation do you want to be?  Yeah.  
**[1:16:48-1:16:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:48):**  Yeah.  So I given that I think I'd pick a domain that I'm interested in.  I think I would do Jordan Peterson.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:16:57):**  So he helped me a ton in 2016.  Like kind of get my head on straight kind of get my, my focus like trying to be carnivore  guy, isn't he?  
**[1:17:09-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:17:09):**  Well, he certainly helps.  He talked about his daughter's transition.  And that's how I found out about it.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:17:15):**  So but I was not really interested, really in his dietary advice.  I was interested in is like, you know, this is the, this is the benefit of our culture.  This is the point of Western ideas.  
**[1:17:31-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:17:31):**  And I was steeped in those stories as a theater major.  I studied philosophy and theology.  And so, and theater, I viewed as the applied, you know, applied application of those philosophies,  
**[1:17:44-1:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:17:44):**  like someone puts out a philosophy, let's see how it goes.  And you know, and so those were the,  the kind of ideas but  
**[1:17:57-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:17:57):**  he really kind of helped me get my get my get my life together when I was deeply sick.  And I didn't know what I was gonna do with my life.  So I really liked the personal development stuff.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:18:08):**  I think I would talk to  Peterson young, call young.  I don't know who he is.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:18:22):**  So he's a famous psychologist.  Like so he came after Freud, Freud kind of pioneered the idea of the subconscious.  And there's all those like, that kind of stuff.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:18:37):**  Is the, the scarier one who talks in vivid imagery that he has all kinds of  insights that he's just incredibly, incredibly gifted.  And I think the last one would be Nietzsche.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:18:53):**  Who Nietzsche, who's that?  So Nietzsche very famously said God is dead.  And that's, that's most of what all everyone knows.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:19:10):**  But he said, and no, no one will be able to, but that's not the end of the quote.  It's God is dead and no one will be able to quench the river of blood that fall out.  It's like, I forget exactly how he says it, but it's like, and that's a bad thing.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:19:26):**  One of the really, really profound, deep things you're like, dude, what did that mean?  Yeah.  So for two days while he explains it.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:19:33):**  Yeah.  So Nietzsche is really dense, hard to understand Carl Jung.  Similarly.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:19:39):**  So Nietzsche is on this philosophy side that like we were kind of using as a society, religion  as the basis of like how we're doing as a moral map.  And so he said that we're kind of abandoning God in favor of this materialistic, progressive,  
**[1:19:58-1:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:19:58):**  you know, progress kind of thing.  But the 20th century with the pitfalls of communism and Nazi is the fascist movements.  It was like, Ooh, wow.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:20:10):**  This isn't always just progress.  It's, you know, it's progressive, it's sometimes we really mess things up.  And so we're kind of searching for our new narrative, you know, as a society, as a species.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:20:25):**  And so Nietzsche is like, on one hand, he kind of pointed out some of those horrific  like philosophical trends.  It's like, we need kind of this unifying story.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:20:37):**  So we know what the good is.  And, you know, and so without religion, if we abandon religion, then we're kind of lost  in this uncomfortable place.  
**[1:20:48-1:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:20:48):**  And there's not a significant story.  And so a lot of ideological thinking, a lot of tribalism and warring social media factions  have kind of taken the place of people's religions.  
**[1:20:58-1:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:20:58):**  And so that's not going well, I don't think.  On social media, it's awful.  So Nietzsche is the philosopher.  
**[1:21:08-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:08):**  Carl Jung is one of the most amazing psychologists ever.  And Jordan Peterson is a student of both.  And maybe he could help me understand some of them better.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:18):**  I don't know.  That's my that's my three.  I think Nietzsche and Carl Jung would log into Twitter and lose their minds.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:27):**  I don't know.  I don't know.  They might.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:31):**  If they watch Austin Peterson's Twitter feed, they'd probably go crazy and say, what is  this crap, you human beings of the future are nuts.  You should never do this.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:40):**  This is a horrible thing.  Do not engage with this application.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:44):**  Well, I don't know.  What about you guys?  What are your three?  
**[1:21:49-1:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:49):**  CK, I'll let you tackle this one.  You haven't had to answer this one yet.  No, I haven't.  
**[1:21:55-1:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:21:55):**  So Elon Musk is like, you know, I got a girl.  I think that would be amazing.  And then I really like Julia Child.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:05):**  So if you guys know who that is, she's just like a really amazing chef who's kind of taught  Americans how to master the art of French cooking.  So I'd like learn a lot of my technical skills off of her cookbook from when I was, you know,  
**[1:22:18-1:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:18):**  just went away to college.  I would love to do that.  And I don't know what my third one would be.  
**[1:22:23-1:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:23):**  I still think about that all the time.  I'm like, I don't even have the answer.  But I do like Jordan Peterson.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:27):**  I actually, you know, I actually don't do take off.  But I do watch his content that he makes because it's just for me, it's like a really motivational  way to like recalibrate recalibrate like, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:44):**  So he just has a really good look out look outlook on life and how to like navigate through  the chaos of today's chaos.  So what about you, Brian?  
**[1:22:55-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:22:55):**  I got to admit that, you know, I did throw that one to you.  So I had to give me a minute to cheat so I could think mine through because I knew it  was coming my way.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:05):**  Yeah.  So and, you know, these courses get to change probably every time we have the conversation,  right?  
**[1:23:13-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:13):**  Because we hear new things, we think new things.  I think my top three choices today would be Snoop Dogg.  Because I'd want to talk to him about branding and marketing and being yourself and being  
**[1:23:28-1:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:28):**  your best self.  I want to talk to Jocko Willink.  Oh, yeah, that's a good one.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:36):**  I want to get his I want to get some of his leadership advice and some of his leadership  knowledge.  And then I think I want to talk to Thomas Massey, Senator from Kentucky.  
**[1:23:45-1:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:45):**  Yeah, interesting.  Yeah, libertarian crisis.  Very, very like leaning libertarian senator from Kentucky.  
**[1:23:53-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:23:53):**  Like I think I think Thomas Massey, he's involved in a regenerative like he supports your journey  of agriculture.  He has a cow farm.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:01):**  I think he actually calls it a ranch but these east of the Mississippi, so they're usually  farms.  He has he has cattle in Kentucky.  
**[1:24:07-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:07):**  And you know, last year as it was last fall, he had some slaughter dates.  And, you know, I followed along on his social media is taking stuff to the slaughter dates.  And he was feeling the same pain that we all were about, you know, the disparity between  
**[1:24:21-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:21):**  cattle price and box beef price and yeah, and just not have any not have any capacity  available to slaughter.  So I think having having a dinner with him and Jocko and Snoop Dogg.  
**[1:24:32-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:32):**  I think that'd be pretty legendary.  That would be I would want to film that.  There's a lot of disparate personalities there and I think it'd be great.  
**[1:24:43-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:43):**  Yeah, I don't know if Jocko would be down with with Snoop Dogg smoking at dinner, but  I know and that's why I got one step at a time.  You could set it up so your dinners fight.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:24:56):**  It'd be great.  Invite Joe Rogan to commentate on it.  Now you're talking.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:25:04):**  I didn't want to invoke the name of the pod father.  Yeah.  Have you heard of Peter Ballistad calling himself the sod father?  
**[1:25:15-1:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:25:15):**  I Yeah, I think I think I've heard that he's a god.  He's Australian, isn't he?  You know, I don't know.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:25:24):**  But he's all about, you know, regenerative agriculture and, and grazing animals and he's  agronomist.  I might be saying that wrong, but he's been he was he talked to the carnivore con and  
**[1:25:41-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:25:41):**  and so we're he's on our radar.  Oh, cool.  Tell us about grass and stuff.  
**[1:25:46-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:25:46):**  He's if I had gone that way, he would have been on a different three person panel.  Fred Provenza would be another really cool one to be able to sit down, pick their brain.  I got to sit down to write some emails.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:26:00):**  I got to email Fred, I want to get on the show one of these days.  You know, and I was thinking, you know, earlier, we kind of touched on about the grass fed  versus grain fed debate.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:26:11):**  And you're in the you're in the diet, nutrition world and the fitness world.  You know, there's, I'm sure there's all kinds of people arguing about keto and paleo and,  and everything else.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:26:21):**  I imagine that the vegans really don't have much of a real, really a substantive argument.  But the point I'd like to make and I had this, I was having this conversation with some friends  the other day is no matter where you fall on the regenerative spectrum, okay, no matter  
**[1:26:37-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:26:37):**  where you fall in a production ag spectrum, okay, your job's not going away.  Like your job is only under threat because your customers are aging out like only a small  percentage of customers that are actively exerting their buying power are going to change  
**[1:26:52-1:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:26:52):**  their long term buying trends or their long term diets.  Right.  So, you know, yeah, we have these K-phone models, beef, chicken and pork.  
**[1:27:01-1:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:27:01):**  We have, you know, the rising heirloom breeds and the pastured grass finished models.  And those are growing.  And there's no doubt that the pastured and grass finished and regenerative food model  
**[1:27:13-1:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:27:13):**  is growing very rapidly.  The K-phone model really isn't.  I mean, it's kind of staying static.  
**[1:27:22-1:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:27:22):**  But the point I'm making is the new consumers were coming in.  Those are the ones we got to focus on.  We got to focus on educating the next generation of consumers.  
**[1:27:31-1:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:27:31):**  And as soon as that generation is starting to exert their buying power and spend money  in the marketplace, we need to be capturing these customers and making sure that they're  bought into these regenerative practices that are long term ecologically much more sustainable  
**[1:27:47-1:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:27:47):**  than the current screwed up system that, you know, that science is trying to sustain.  So what I'm getting at here is like it shouldn't necessarily be competition.  It shouldn't necessarily be a lot of fighting.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:28:02):**  Yeah, we think that people aren't transitioning fast enough to our way of thinking.  And I think that's a basic flaw.  You know, one of the basic parts of being a human being is you're never patient enough.  
**[1:28:16-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:28:16):**  You always want things to be faster and change faster, and you're never happy with what other  people are doing.  And you expect everybody to be happy with what you're doing.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:28:25):**  So these models of commodity grain production and commodity beef production and big chicken  houses and big pork houses, they're not going to go away overnight, no matter how much Cory  Booker and Elizabeth Warren want them to.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:28:41):**  Not going away overnight, guys.  But they are going to scale down.  They are going to drop back.  
**[1:28:46-1:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:28:46):**  So as we go forward in the future, you know, we're capturing these new consumers and we're  capturing their dollars and we're educating them.  And the other consumers, they're just aging out.  
**[1:29:00-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:00):**  And you know, it's not worth fighting.  But I guess that's what I'm saying.  It's like, I don't even want to fight about fake meat anymore because it's not worth fighting  
**[1:29:09-1:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:09):**  about.  Like the people that eat that crap, I know what I think is going to happen to them.  I should not eat it.  
**[1:29:17-1:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:17):**  Well, people, fortunately, whoever or whatever designed us designed as well.  They don't like it.  They don't feel good.  
**[1:29:27-1:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:27):**  They're not doing well on fake meat.  So it doesn't sell.  If it's based on selling, people don't buy it.  
**[1:29:35-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:35):**  The profits are going down from what I saw.  It's like just in the news that like fake meat, like Beyond Meat.  And I just call them all fake meat.  
**[1:29:44-1:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:44):**  But like all the fake meat companies are hurting.  They're reporting much lower than expected revenues and profits.  And partly because the expected revenue was just hopium.  
**[1:29:55-1:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:29:55):**  It wasn't based on anything.  And I agree that the KFO model is not going anywhere as things are right now.  But I fear that the stranglehold that the slaughterhouse is out on the system, the cargo,  
**[1:30:12-1:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:30:12):**  JBS, National Beef, Tyson, it's like that's 80% of North America.  That is a little toxic.  And those companies are investing in fake meat.  
**[1:30:27-1:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:30:27):**  So to me, the writing is a little bit on the wall when it comes to regenerative ag.  And this may just be because I have a background as being a soldier that I'm thinking about  long term.  
**[1:30:41-1:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:30:41):**  You understand supply chains and logistics.  I've always liked about you.  I don't really like the fact that I only eat one thing.  
**[1:30:49-1:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:30:49):**  I would like to have some of that like off the power grid, safe and secure.  I don't really like the idea that your cow can't live without grain.  It's like, you know, grain might help, but it shouldn't need it if it needs it in order  
**[1:31:08-1:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:31:08):**  to skin and bones without that grain and molasses.  It's like, you might be you might be working with some really poor quality soil and you  might not be managing that soil to the best of your ability.  
**[1:31:21-1:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:31:21):**  It's like, and your your animals might not fit your environment at all.  Yeah, you might need a different breed.  You might need a different kind of genetic profile that handles like the area that you're  
**[1:31:33-1:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:31:33):**  in where it's the water or the heat.  You know, you want to have an animal that's well adjusted to your environment and then  you want to do your best to maximize that.

I think about national security, but not in a America first kind of way, just in a like.  You know, maybe an asteroid hits country X if country Y is not affected and can help  
**[1:32:01-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:01):**  out great, but like you never know who's going to have a terrible day and it'd be better  if every country could stand on its own two feet, produce its own food and produce healthy  food that doesn't need a lot of inputs.  
**[1:32:17-1:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:17):**  The way that we're globalizing everything and making it hyper fragile really gets under  my skin because when that system slows down or starts to break, we can't do shipping internationally  anymore.  
**[1:32:32-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:32):**  It's like all those containers just sitting out in the Pacific Ocean.  It's like waiting to get unloaded.  No truckers to unload them, no dock workers to unload them.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:40):**  It's like, I hope anything that you're waiting on isn't important.  You know what's not waiting on it.  You know what's not stuck on in shipping?  
**[1:32:48-1:32:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:48):**  Made in the USA.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Not in a shipping container.  
**[1:32:52-1:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:32:52):**  Not stuck in a port.  The thing about made in USA is there's hundreds of different components, many of which are  made in multiple different countries.  
**[1:33:02-1:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:02):**  I think like a cell phone, like it's like 67 different countries make the bits of this  and then it's assembled in the last country it touches.  It's really not representative.  
**[1:33:16-1:33:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:16):**  A lot of this gets into your area again.  Made in America or grass fed beef, American grass fed beef.  It's like, was it packaged in America and raised in Australia?  
**[1:33:28-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:28):**  It's like, come on guys.  This isn't- Let's be honest here.  Yeah, let's be honest.  
**[1:33:36-1:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:36):**  Let's just be honest here.  Where did it come from?  I always have to ask that question.  
**[1:33:45-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:45):**  Anybody that's trying to sell me a product, where does this come from?  Well I get it from factory XYZ.  Okay, well that's not good enough.  
**[1:33:53-1:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:33:53):**  I want to know where it really comes from.  Especially when it comes to food.  I feel like not knowing where your food comes from is a particular problem.  
**[1:34:03-1:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:03):**  If you have something, if you have a gadget or a tool or a hammer, it doesn't really matter  so much.  But anything that goes in your body, anything you put on your skin, anything that's in contact  
**[1:34:16-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:16):**  with you, it's an intimate product, food.  You should know what's in it.  Now a lot of people are going to have different levels of filters.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:27):**  It doesn't matter as long as it tastes good.  I don't care.  I mean, ingredients list is like 30 pages.  
**[1:34:34-1:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:34):**  No problem.  That's fine.  But we should each make our own choice about that because if something goes wrong and you  
**[1:34:42-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:42):**  are making an informed decision, then you pay the price.  But if you're not making an informed decision and you're kind of trusting the system, I  feel like that's where we get into this hazy, who's holding the bag?  
**[1:34:59-1:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:34:59):**  Like everybody, well, nobody.  So then it gets dropped.  It's like-  
**[1:35:03-1:35:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:03):**  And that's back to that trust the science argument, right?  I get sick and whose problem is it?  Who's to blame?  
**[1:35:10-1:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:10):**  It's like, no one's to blame.  Well then who helps fix my health?  It's like, well-  
**[1:35:18-1:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:18):**  Well trust the science.  Malaria kills millions of soldiers.  So it's not like I'm mad at the army.  
**[1:35:26-1:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:26):**  It's just, they did their best and their best got included me getting dysbiosis.  I did not become a casualty.  And that's what they were concerned with.  
**[1:35:37-1:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:37):**  I look mostly fine.  I have all my bits.  So I'm a success.  
**[1:35:42-1:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:42):**  You were so combat effective, you could pick up your rifle and go to work.  But a lot of our soldiers couldn't digest their food.  They were taking chemicals to pass things through and chemicals to stop passing things  
**[1:35:58-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:35:58):**  through.  And then-  And then probably chemicals to sleep because they weren't sleeping well.  
**[1:36:03-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:36:03):**  Which is illegal, which is not allowed in a combat zone.  But we had soldiers there who didn't sleep for weeks, which is also not good for a combat  zone.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:36:13):**  So the plan never works out.  And so you should really, I think, limit your risks.  Because the plan is never going to go according to how you think it's going to go.  
**[1:36:27-1:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:36:27):**  And so maybe we shouldn't take so many risks fast and loose with confidence in our own  science and our own understanding.  Just a dash of humility could go a long way.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:36:41):**  You know what Mike Tyson says, everybody's got a plan till they get punched in the teeth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  And life hits hard.  
**[1:36:53-1:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:36:53):**  And so you got to be willing to be responsive and pivot and change your plan and adapt.  And so if you live on the edge, everything's bleeding to almost failure all the time.  You can't handle any adversity.  
**[1:37:10-1:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:37:10):**  Yeah, that's true.  Adversity of combat, I served, I spent a little over eight years in the Navy, but I was not  boots on the ground combat.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:37:22):**  I didn't have to pick up a gun every day and go back to work.  I wasn't a firebase of people shooting at me.  Like I was a pretty relatively safe boat.  
**[1:37:29-1:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:37:29):**  Not a whole lot went wrong.  But what I'm interested in is, did it mess with you at all coming from the theater world  of make believe combat where you're trying to keep people safe, moving to the army and  
**[1:37:46-1:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:37:46):**  being a combat medic and trying to keep people safe, like going from like the context of  doing that in a theater setting to doing that in combat.  Did that mess with you?  
**[1:37:57-1:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:37:57):**  It did because in theater we took things more seriously.  Okay you have to unpack that.  You took things more seriously in theater than you did in combat.  
**[1:38:11-1:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:38:11):**  Deadly seriously.  It was basically because this is the military, we just do whatever.  We follow the regulations most of the time until you get that one commander who just  
**[1:38:26-1:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:38:26):**  doesn't.  You're like, just worry about keeping your buddies alive, right?  Yeah, and then you get into these toxic leadership situations where people are worried about  
**[1:38:38-1:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:38:38):**  the promotion and the careers and all these points and all this gaming of the system and  it's this tired, old, stale bureaucracy.  I mean, especially the army.  
**[1:38:50-1:39:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:38:50):**  The army is the oldest and biggest.  Navy is not any different.  Okay, but it's like everything's really stale and you do the bare minimum to stay safe and  
**[1:39:01-1:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:39:01):**  oftentimes fail horribly and people get hurt and that's fine because it's war.  It's like, no, this part wasn't war.  This part was just negligence, incompetence, but those people aren't held accountable.  
**[1:39:19-1:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:39:19):**  In theater or my other very serious organization I was in, the Boy Scouts, that person was  relieved immediately.  They're gone.  
**[1:39:29-1:39:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:39:29):**  People are trusting you with their kids.  You're gone.  If you are unsafe with knives or unsafe with fire or you are belittling to a child or a  
**[1:39:40-1:39:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:39:40):**  Boy Scout or you go off in a theater set and you tear into someone inappropriately or you're  abusive, you're toast.  No one tolerates that because they don't have to.  
**[1:39:52-1:40:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:39:52):**  But as soon as they put those shackles on and you have to do it and you can't quit,  and in theory they could literally put you up against a wall firing squad and execute  you.  
**[1:40:07-1:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:40:07):**  The military owns you.  You're not a person.  You don't have rights.  
**[1:40:10-1:40:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:40:10):**  You don't have political opinions.  You are a tool of the state.  You're a number in a file at Milpers that gets to use a name.  
**[1:40:23-1:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:40:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  Only the last one.  The first name privilege is removed.  
**[1:40:29-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:40:29):**  But I learned a lot in the service and I appreciated it, but I realized that they were these kind  of hard-brigganed crusty sergeants and NCOs that kind of said all the right things and  then actually got the mission done despite the inefficiencies and the BS of the system.  
**[1:40:55-1:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:40:55):**  They were these – It's like maybe one in three in the Navy.  Yeah, it's like, well, there's one person who actually can do their job and everything  rotates around them and they make the mission happen.  
**[1:41:08-1:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:41:08):**  And the longer that the Army kind of goes on, I feel like we're getting weaker and we're  getting more bureaucratic.  And because we don't have shared values and a shared narrative, like I was talking about  
**[1:41:24-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:41:24):**  the philosophy, we don't know what the good is.  We don't know what a good man is.  And so –  
**[1:41:31-1:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:41:31):**  They keep rewriting the dictionary.  Well, at a certain point, that starts to really break down bureaucratic systems because some  of these bureaucratic systems were built with a certain societal norms in mind that weren't  
**[1:41:49-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:41:49):**  written down.  So the magic formula of it working and leadership working and mentorship, there's a little fuzzy  bit that kind of is the glue that holds all these systems together that is our culture.  
**[1:42:03-1:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:03):**  And losing our culture means we kind of lose our bearing in this new map, in this new paradigm.  It's like, well, why would I do this heroic thing?  Why would I stick my neck out?  
**[1:42:15-1:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:15):**  Why would I stand up and take responsibility for something that wasn't directly exactly  my fault?  Like Jocko's extreme leadership.  
**[1:42:23-1:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:23):**  It's like, well, why?  It's like, well, you've got to see the long picture.  If you take responsibility, it's not only going to make people want to follow you, but  
**[1:42:35-1:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:35):**  it's actually going to help you get through your day.  It's going to give you a sense of meaning and purpose.  It's going to improve you.  
**[1:42:42-1:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:42):**  You're going to grow as a person and then the mission will succeed.  So the nation wins, you win and your platoon wins.  It's like, it's win-win-win.  
**[1:42:53-1:43:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:42:53):**  It's like, that's why we go to the trouble of learning leadership.  And it's like, well, that's not always that important to people anymore.  Everyone doesn't believe in the system that it's just there for the college money and  
**[1:43:07-1:43:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:43:07):**  the paycheck and the benefits.  So without that belief, that magic crusty Sergeant who knows all the tricks and games  and how to get the thing from supply that no one else can get, that person retires.  
**[1:43:22-1:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:43:22):**  He doesn't get replaced.  There's no replacement.  And so that lynchpin who's holding the old cultures and the old ways together and making  
**[1:43:31-1:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:43:31):**  the bureaucratic system, eek through and get to the next year, that's starting to grind  to a halt.  And that's happening in many, many different industries.  
**[1:43:42-1:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:43:42):**  At least in my experience, it sounds like you had a similar experience in the Navy.  I think that's just the nature of complex bureaucracies and the longer they exist, the  more rules get piled on top of each other and pile on top of each other and nothing  
**[1:43:58-1:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:43:58):**  ever gets, there's never a bottom up review of everything.  So they just keep piling things on, on the bottom of a shaky pyramid that, like you said,  maybe wasn't ever written down because it was just understood at the time that those  
**[1:44:13-1:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:44:13):**  traditions were founded, that this is how society was.  This is how shit operated.  And this is what we're going to do.  
**[1:44:19-1:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:44:19):**  And they built off of that.  They built off of a foundation that they didn't necessarily write down, whether that's a good,  bad, right, wrong, or indifferent, we're not here to debate that, but we've piled so much  
**[1:44:29-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:44:29):**  crap on top of the foundation and it's gone so far outside the bounds of what that foundation  can morally support that we see these bureaucratic institutions are starting to creak and crumble  from, and rot from within because the people that know how to navigate the bureaucracy  
**[1:44:47-1:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:44:47):**  are the ones that rise to the top.  Yep.  And it's not the ones that are there to be on mission that rise.  
**[1:44:56-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:44:56):**  It's the ones that know how to navigate bureaucracy.  Yeah.  Fear like they're on mission.

**[1:45:11-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:45:11):**  Actually I was listening to Jocko.  Jocko said here are all these accomplishments.  You are not rewarded as a leader for taking risks, which you'd want.  
**[1:45:24-1:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:45:24):**  I mean, zero risk is not the right amount of risk for a leader to take, unless you're  going up to a review board.  So which is a paradox because the way they rate the system, it's like, well, you made  
**[1:45:38-1:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:45:38):**  a mistake and why'd you do that?  You're a bad leader.  Like this guy, this other guy is all the same qualifications.  
**[1:45:45-1:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:45:45):**  Didn't make a mistake.  It's like, because he played it safe.  And so the people at the top are like the most milk toast cautious, definitely saying  
**[1:45:54-1:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:45:54):**  the right thing.  Definitely not doing the right thing because doing the right thing is hard.  You will make mistakes.  
**[1:46:01-1:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:01):**  You will make yourself vulnerable.  You will put yourself out there.  And when you do that and you're not perfect, you get nailed to the wall.  
**[1:46:09-1:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:09):**  And so we're actively discouraging the qualities we need to make our society run.  I agree.  How do we fix it?  
**[1:46:19-1:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:19):**  Well, Philip, I'm going to put you in charge of what you need to be in charge of and give  you all the power.  I think that's the first mistake right there.  
**[1:46:32-1:46:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:32):**  My first job on duty is I'm going to hire someone qualified.  Job one, hire somebody smarter than me to do this job.  Yeah.  
**[1:46:43-1:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:43):**  Yeah.  I'm going to spend all of my time looking for someone better.  But good answer.  
**[1:46:51-1:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:46:51):**  On my personal note, what am I doing is I think that I want to be really encouraging  to regenerative agriculture.  I think that it is likely that our civilization collapses sometime in my lifetime.  
**[1:47:08-1:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:47:08):**  I don't think that's right.  I don't know the future, but I don't see these systems that are abusive, caustic, toxic,  you know, just unpleasant.  
**[1:47:20-1:47:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:47:20):**  They're unpleasant to be in charge of.  They're unpleasant to endure.  And I just don't see them lasting.  
**[1:47:26-1:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:47:26):**  I see a lot of financial games being played.  It's just going to come crashing down.  I think if we have a robust regenerative agriculture community, we can rebuild.  
**[1:47:38-1:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:47:38):**  But I think human beings are the kind of animal that's got to feel a little pain before it  thinks about changing what it's doing.  And so that means this system that's so complicated, we won't see the pain until it collapses.  
**[1:47:55-1:48:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:47:55):**  Because there are thousands of different signs, different supply chain issues, different kind  of political issues, polarization, that, you know, the hyperbolic stuff that I'm trying  to avoid, even getting anywhere near.  
**[1:48:14-1:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:48:14):**  I think that that is going to, it's not going to last.  And so when it doesn't last, we're not going to see it coming.  And it's going to hit us like a hurricane.  
**[1:48:22-1:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:48:22):**  People don't know how fragile power grid is, the power, the internet, the water, sewer,  the streets, like everything that just the trash, you put trash outside and just goes  away by magic, like fairies, just take it into the distance.  
**[1:48:39-1:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:48:39):**  It's gone.  Like in Afghanistan, every single piece of trash, we burned by hand, you know, every  single bottle of water we drink, we had to lift first into the context, you know, every  
**[1:48:54-1:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:48:54):**  single thing we ate, we had to lift every bullet.  We didn't fire a lot, mostly just at dumb stuff.  But we carried them, you know, no one brought them there, we brought them there.  
**[1:49:08-1:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:49:08):**  And so, guard duty us staying up all night, watching, nothing.  It's like, yeah, it's like when you have to be self reliant, and you have these military  experiences, you know, it kind of like, huh, you know, who does all these things that are  
**[1:49:27-1:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:49:27):**  just magic and wonderful, I turn on the light switch and boom, instant power, it's like,  someone's burning a little more coal, because I turned on this light switch.  And somehow that's all calculated, and the transformer doesn't explode.  
**[1:49:41-1:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:49:41):**  And the science behind it is insane.  And people take that for granted.  I don't know how that's gonna go.  
**[1:49:48-1:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:49:48):**  But you know, it's concerning.  And we walk around with these supercomputers in our pockets.  Yeah, it's 2021.  
**[1:49:57-1:50:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:49:57):**  Everybody's got a smartphone.  It's a supercomputer compared to anything that was available 20 years ago.  It's got a camera on it that's better than anything that was available 20 years ago.  
**[1:50:09-1:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:50:09):**  And they had it, they had it in the stand.  One of my missions was 12 hours on 12 hours off, guard the cell phone tower because people  are going to blow it up.  
**[1:50:21-1:50:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:50:21):**  Taliban wants to blow up and disrupt communications.  I don't know how credible that threat is.  We never faced enemy action on that mission.  
**[1:50:30-1:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:50:30):**  We mostly just, well, they didn't blow up the cell phone tower because you were there  guarding it soldier.  Maybe.  
**[1:50:36-1:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:50:36):**  But, you know, they would have a tiny little solar panel.  And they would charge their cell phone, and they would charge their little radio.  They had no power, they had no running water, they had no food.  
**[1:50:51-1:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:50:51):**  They well, they had a goat.  So they did have some food.  But like, you know, cut it, they probably sold it, and then bought heroin.  
**[1:51:01-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:51:01):**  You know, it was like, one of those kind of things.  It was rough.  These are rough places.  
**[1:51:07-1:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:51:07):**  And we brought them water, we drilled them wells.  But they would take like, I saw this kid, it just it's this shocking image of a kid  drinking out of a oil can.  
**[1:51:20-1:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:51:20):**  Just a plastic bottle because plastic bottle, he didn't have a cup.  There were no dishes.  And so he had this like yellow oil can.  
**[1:51:32-1:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:51:32):**  He rinsed it out, presumably, and was drinking water out.  unsupervised, of course, in a mud hut that had a solar panel, a radio so they could listen  to their their religious songs and texts, and, and a cell phone, no running water, no  
**[1:51:51-1:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:51:51):**  food, no infrastructure to speak of nothing, nothing going for them, except for the little  wheat field, we gave them wheat.  And they were selling it by hand, instead of opium.  
**[1:52:02-1:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:52:02):**  It's the economic equivalent of like, you know, Flintstone Carter in your way across  the mirror.  It's like,  
**[1:52:09-1:52:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:52:09):**  you know, the potential per acre from opium versus wheat, I imagine.  I don't have any first day and experience growing opium.  But I know some guys that grow wheat, I know it's kind of a low margin operation, I can  
**[1:52:20-1:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:52:20):**  imagine opium is better.  We had we had, I watched a half a, I'd say actually, like a third of a football field,  size field.  
**[1:52:32-1:52:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:52:32):**  Third of a football field is right in front of my guard tower, I watched this guy plant  wheat and harvest it by hand.  He had a six year old assistant, and he spent all day every day on his hands and knees,  
**[1:52:47-1:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:52:47):**  so a wheat seed.  And his return on that was like,  maybe, you know, $50 for the the week that he was able to raise.  
**[1:53:00-1:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:53:00):**  And he worked a whole year.  And it was like, dude, that is not going to work when we leave and stop giving him free  wheat seed.  
**[1:53:09-1:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:53:09):**  It's like, I don't blame them.  This is so hard work.  Like, I just sat there watching, you know, waiting for the ground to blow up and it didn't.  
**[1:53:21-1:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:53:21):**  But it's such brutal work, creating food, and cows and ruminants are just absolutely  amazing at it, the kind of health and the kind of strength, intelligence and fertility  you can get from animal products versus plant products and the amount of effort it takes  
**[1:53:41-1:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:53:41):**  and machinery and technology.  It's just, it's night and day animal agriculture, especially regenerative is just tactically  practically and like regeneratively like future proof.  
**[1:53:55-1:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:53:55):**  The only way to go because topsoil takes like 1000 years to grow 11 centimeters is never  going to come back on its own if we don't help.  That's right.  
**[1:54:06-1:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:06):**  That's absolutely right.  Well, we're bumping up on two hours.  Yep.  
**[1:54:12-1:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:12):**  I'd love to keep going.  But I'm a one man show here at the house today.  And I got to take care of my chickens before dark.  
**[1:54:18-1:54:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:18):**  Hey, cool.  That is that is a beautiful reason.  Yeah, so social media, where can we find you on social media?  
**[1:54:27-1:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:27):**  You got Instagram, Twitter, where yet?  Carnivore Bar, Carnivore Bar website.  And it's just carnivorebar.com and on Instagram as the Carnivore Bar.  
**[1:54:44-1:54:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:44):**  So we're pretty easy to find.  We don't post a ton because we're busy making meat bars.  Okay, you on Twitter?  
**[1:54:55-1:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:54:55):**  No, I mean, I guess the Carnivore Bar like retweets the thing on Instagram.  I did that on Twitter for a long time.  Twitter is an interesting place.  
**[1:55:09-1:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:09):**  If you want to reach me, Philip Mies on Facebook, you reach out on Facebook.  Facebook is a great way to reach me if you want to talk to me.  Okay.  
**[1:55:17-1:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:17):**  I'll put all those links in the show notes.  Anything you want to add?  Anything I forgot to ask?  
**[1:55:24-1:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:24):**  It was a real pleasure, Brian.  I'm glad.  I'm glad I got to talk with you.  
**[1:55:29-1:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:29):**  Yeah, it's been awesome, Philip.  It's been great to catch up.  And like I said, when that box showed up back in January, February, I wasn't expecting I'm  
**[1:55:37-1:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:37):**  like, what's this?  This is odd.  Open it up.  
**[1:55:41-1:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:41):**  Oh, Carnivore Bar.  Shit.  I'm like scrolling through my bank account.  
**[1:55:45-1:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:45):**  I'm like, did I send him more money?  No, I think I just, I was sending it to you.  You were curious about it.  
**[1:55:52-1:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:52):**  I think I forgot I didn't have any samples or whatever.  I was like, I'll just send you a box.  I probably harassed you on social media or something.  
**[1:55:58-1:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:55:58):**  Sounds like what you should do.  Well, I think I'll get you some new ones.  See what you think.  
**[1:56:03-1:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:03):**  I'm looking forward to it.  And offline, I'll shoot you CK's address so you can get some up to her too.  Absolutely.  
**[1:56:10-1:56:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:10):**  All right.  Well, thanks for joining me today, Phillip and well, CK, she had to leave a half hour  ago.  
**[1:56:17-1:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:17):**  We didn't make a big deal out of it.  She had to jump off and make another call half hour ago.  So she did a, she did an Irish exit, you know, that kind of like just wave from the corner  
**[1:56:26-1:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:26):**  and then dart to the door.  Well, Phillip, thank you for joining me today.  It's been an absolute blast.  
**[1:56:34-1:56:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:34):**  Yeah, it's been a pleasure.  All right gang, have a great week.  We'll see you later.  
**[1:56:37-1:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/42-Phillip-Meece-Measuring-the-Metrics-of-Success-e1b9c30#t=1:56:37):**  See ya.  We'll be right back after this is over.

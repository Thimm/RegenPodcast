As I sit here and I'm finishing up editing this episode and getting ready to upload it,  I'm thinking back to just about a year ago.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:00:58):**  Almost exactly a year ago today in fact.  Our first episode was just about ready to come out and I was honestly pretty nervous.  It's been a really wild ride this last year of learning how to podcast and meeting all  
**[0:01:11-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:01:11):**  kinds of amazing and wonderful guests from every corner of the United States and even  some from Canada.  I look forward to going into the second year of podcasting and trying to grow this thing

**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:13):**  Hey, man, how are you doing today?  I'm doing great.  You know, it's a pretty good weather up here.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:19):**  Sun is shining.  Cows are fat and happy.  Still about three weeks away from having any calves.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:24):**  So are you?  Yeah, yeah, kind of looking kind of looking forward to that pretty exciting time.  Yes, actually, I really am because this is the first time that I've had the cows.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:37):**  And I did all the breeding to all the cows that I have.  Like last year, I bought some cows that were already bred.  So this is this is the first calf crop that's 100% I bred them.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:48):**  Congratulations.  Tell me more about the breeding.  I've been looking a lot into that I was actually watching the Angus documentary this morning  
**[0:02:55-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:02:55):**  from the very beginning from gosh, what was his name Grant Andrew Grant, I believe from  Scotland brought over for Angus to Kansas.  Okay.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:03:09):**  I am breeding in Angus, but my cows are Coriante cows.  Okay.  I really like the Coriante breed because they've got their their descended from the Creole  
**[0:03:18-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:03:18):**  cattle that the Spanish brought over in the 1500s.  And they kind of went feral in the desert southwest and in northern Mexico for 400 years,  so they've got 400 years of Mother Nature driving their genetic selection and adaptation.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:03:33):**  Wow.  And granted, you know, we're in the modern era, the last, you know, 60, 70, 80 years,  we've had access to, you know, balers, we can move forage around and high energy feed  
**[0:03:43-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:03:43):**  crops like you know, corn soybeans.  I think that's really messed up some genetics.  And we can get into that later.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:03:53):**  But I feel the Coriante breed represents the greatest untapped reserve of forage efficient  genetics.  So I'm trying to take that select for fertility and add a little bit of frame and add a little  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:04:07):**  bit of muscle.  That's awesome.  I want to hear I'm definitely going to hear a lot more, you know, as we move forward with  
**[0:04:13-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:04:13):**  our, you know, communication and you know, relationship and stuff like that.  It's I don't think that a lot of the general public even understands the the dynamics of  what goes into the thought of, you know, breeding our cattle for us.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:04:28):**  So that's why I'm fat.  I'm diving in the so it's gonna be a fun journey.  And what we covered this with Steve Stratford a couple weeks ago, you know, we've been with  
**[0:04:40-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:04:40):**  the genetics have been shifting one direction for a long time, because that's what we've  been told as producers that we need to have.  Well, we've gone too far, like we're just completely over rotated on a lot of the carcass  
**[0:04:53-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:04:53):**  size and it's biting guys in the butt and carcass size has to come back down to get  some profitability back to the farmer ranch gate in the commodity sector.  But that's what we're not here today to talk about.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:04):**  We're not talking about playing the existing game now under somebody else's rules.  We're talking about completely changing the game and putting the producer back in the  driver's seat, right?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:15):**  100% I mean, that's the that's the only way we can look at it moving forward.  You know, very little compromises and on the on the back end, you've really got to look  at the industry as a whole understand it, not judge it, but it definitely asked it has  
**[0:05:30-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:30):**  to be forward thinking from here on out.  We can't look over our shoulders as much as you know, everybody's been so dependent upon  because it's getting us in a very difficult situation these days.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:41):**  And as producers, we can't just continue to take these things that we're told at face  value, we have to start really looking at well, who's paying them to say this or who  funded this research.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:52):**  So let's talk about beef initiative.  What sure.  What is the beef initiative?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:05:58):**  Beef initiative is many things right now.  Right now it's, you know, what it is, because you and I are talking, it's a form of awareness.  It's like, hey, we're beginning a conversation here that a lot of people haven't been having.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:06:11):**  And if they have, it's it's been kind of compartmentalized.  It's been probably in a bubble of sorts between certain parts of the industry.  The way I look at it is the beef initiative is basically a new decentralized way of thinking  
**[0:06:26-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:06:26):**  about farming and ranching in our nation.  And it comes with a lot of food intelligence that you know, I've been able to put together  a team that I've worked with kind of behind the scenes of saying, Hey, how are we going  
**[0:06:38-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:06:38):**  to approach this as far as getting people back to looking at the rancher for local rancher,  of course, as a form of pure animal protein in a form of nutrition that we have lost.  So by saying that, you know, it's a big umbrella of a lot of things.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:06:54):**  But right now I wanted this next year, it's going to be a lot of education about, you  know, where we came from, and then a lot of innovation moving forward.  These are new tools that we're going to present to the industry.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:07:06):**  These are the people that we're going to be talking with.  These are the relationships that we're going to build.  This is the type of information we want from the rancher so they can bring the input into  
**[0:07:15-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:07:15):**  us and we can give it out to the world because everybody's starting to pay attention.  And I think as much as we can talk about the evils of social media and different platforms,  they're doing a lot of good by helping spread this awareness.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:07:32):**  They're giving us producers a platform to share our stories instead of just the story  that, you know, for lack of a better term, let's just say big ag and big farmer want  to be told.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:07:45):**  Right.  So, yeah, go ahead.  Where are you from?  
**[0:07:51-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:07:51):**  I'm from the Texas Panhandle.  My whole family is from Texas.  We're about seventh generational Texan, but the Texas Panhandle, I think we got there  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:01):**  in the late 1800s.  What's the Panhandle?  What's that?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:04):**  What part of the Panhandle?  My family originated out of a place called Lottie, Texas.  And it's up there on the, it's on the Yano Estacado.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:17):**  It's out in the middle of the desert, great plains, you know, but I grew up in Canyon,  Texas, outside of Amarillo.  So that's, you know, Amarillo was Charles Goodnight trading post.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:28):**  So there's a lot of cattle history here.  It's in the blood of a lot of people.  The agriculture and ranching is this, the whole area.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:36):**  This is how it was formed.  Okay.  So what you're, you're obviously a gentleman of a few more years than I am.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:46):**  Sure.  So let's tell me some of your story.  How did you get to care about food so much?  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:08:54):**  That's a long story just because I was raised my grandfather.  I mean, he survived the great depression.  He survived the couple of world wars.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:01):**  He's just survived the dust bowl.  He thrived as a farmer.  He you know, he made it work in a different system than we had now.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:11):**  So as far as the family and the heritage, it's, you know, it's just in our blood.  So we come from agriculture.  I growing up was around it.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:20):**  I was able to perform some ranching, you know, horses.  I mean, I just had that cowboy life as it is in West Texas.  I had access to a lot of different types of lifestyles from harvesting to, you know, calving  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:35):**  to learning horses to roping.  But I wasn't, you know, a master of any of them.  I was just around it.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:42):**  It was just a lifestyle.  You know, you had your rodeos, you had the tri state fair, you had the farm and ranch  rodeo, you had all kinds of stuff that was just available.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:09:51):**  So I knew kind of how the food apparatus worked.  I when I was young, I went to Austin, Texas, and I fell into technology.  It was something that was very good at it.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:03):**  I was self taught.  And so I learned a form of project management research analysis, I landed in some good startup  companies, and it gave me a really cool toolset.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:13):**  And that's how I spent most of my adult life.  It afforded me a lot of travel.  I've been around the world a couple times, I've seen a lot of cultures, a lot of foods,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:23):**  a lot of industries in different forms that a lot of people don't ever get to see.  As I got into the age, I'm a generation XR, you know, as I've started looking at things  and how it was when I grew up, and to where we are now, I could tell that there was a  
**[0:10:40-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:40):**  problem with the food industry.  And I've known about it for a while.  But when COVID hit, I said, Okay, I'm going to use all this skill set.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:49):**  I'm going to lean back on my heritage of my grandfather and the where I was raised, especially  in the state of Texas.  And I was going to look at the food, I was going to find a way to start communicating  
**[0:10:59-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:10:59):**  the issues that are at hand.  I have a lot of people that I know that are in the medical industry, I have a lot of people  I know that in the farming and ranching industry, I have a lot of people in the technology,

We all get into Bitcoin at certain points in time in our lives.  But what people don't understand is the aspect of the decentralized thinking of Bitcoin.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:11:29):**  It affords people a new perspective and a new reflection to where you can actually kind  of look at the truth a little bit easier.  And it's a study, it's a time preference thing, it's a low time preference thing.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:11:44):**  So it started all coming together with food intelligence solutions that we need to innovate  into.  And here we are.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:11:54):**  So Bitcoin is one of the things that we talk about a lot.  The argument I get is what happens if the internet goes down?  What happens if technology fails?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:07):**  What happens if those little people?  Okay, I'm gonna put this real quick.  Okay, I'm gonna say this real quick.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:12):**  People that usually ask that question do not understand technology to the level that they  need to.  And also, and this is not judgment.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:22):**  I'm not being a sarcastic smart ass either.  But this is something that if we don't have the internet, we don't have society.  Bottom line.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:31):**  So you can agree, you can forget about that.  Okay, you don't have supply chain lines.  You don't have fuel, you don't have electricity, you don't have anything.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:40):**  Let's get back to caveman days.  Okay, so who cares?  You know, let's barter some shells if we have to.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:46):**  But as far as the day and if it quits working, there's we're gonna have bigger problems.  Well, you better you better know how to raise some livestock like you do.  And that's going to be what you focus on.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:12:57):**  That will be your time preference that you focus on surviving.  And a lot of people don't understand the internet was built to survive nuclear holocaust.  So if you're if you're going to talk this game of saying, well, the internet goes down,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:12):**  you know, the Bitcoin doesn't work.  It's just not a it's not a good argument.  And so you know that having that perspective, I can understand why people say that it's  
**[0:13:22-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:22):**  it's totally logical to say that.  But I want people to understand if the internet goes down, Bitcoin or cash or anything else  is not going to say  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:32):**  it's having nails and bullets and beans and seeds.  It's the source of the seed.  Yeah, it really is.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:38):**  It's like, how do we survive?  You know, do you have a space?  Do you have, you know, a good neighbor?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:43):**  Do you have good localization?  Do you have a good community?  Do you know how to grow your own food?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:47):**  Do you know how to raise your own food?  Do you know how to process your own food?  You know, it comes down to the basics of that.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:13:53):**  And it's, you know, it's our ancestor did it.  It's our grandparents and great grandparents did it to a certain form.  It was a decentralized way of living.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:02):**  And you know, if you if you know that about your heritage, and you know that about money  and how money has so been centralized, and it is control apparatus from the Federal Reserve  to the central banks and everything, you start seeing that Bitcoin is an option for you to  
**[0:14:18-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:18):**  be able to leverage, you know, especially within your food supply, and if you're a producer  or a supplier.  Can you explain that a little more on on why it's a good leverage over a fiat currency?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:31):**  Well, a fiat currency has no scarcity.  And so that, you know, they can print, they just printed $8 trillion in the last couple  of years, like 40% of all the money that's ever been printed has been printed in the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:44):**  last three years or some career.  Yeah.  And so that, you know, look, we're in we're in hyperinflation right now the government  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:50):**  won't even admit you know what inflation is, they say CPI, they don't even bring food into  the CPI.  It's just that's a clown show.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:14:59):**  I'm sorry.  Inflation is out of control right now.  And people are suffering and this is going to get worse.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:04):**  It's only started.  So as far as looking at that, you need a store of value that you can put your your asset  value into.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:11):**  Okay, where are you going to put it right now?  Where's the value of your cow right now?  Is it in a US area?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:19):**  What's that?  Because that they're carrying?  That's where the value of them is for you right now.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:23):**  It is right?  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:26):**  So there's a cow out there that will say, well, my value is in the USDA insurance policy.  Okay, that's where the value is, because they have to have that USDA insurance policies  policy to survive every year.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:36):**  It's not a judgment.  It's just the truth.  It's happening.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:39):**  Or some people say, well, you know, my value is in the grain that I had that that cow recycles  from, you know, from Monsanto and Bayer Cargill.  So that's where the value is.  
**[0:15:49-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:15:49):**  It's in the price and the profit of that grain.  Well, it used to be in the land, and for a long time, it was in the cow itself.  Well, a lot of times, whenever you're pursuing a store of value that has basically no scarcity,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:16:03):**  it can change with futures with commodities with energy prices, with grain prices with  water prices, then you don't have a stable store of value that you can rely on to help  you get through a season, the next season to increase the value of your your cow or  
**[0:16:20-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:16:20):**  your calf that is in that mother heifer.  Okay, so you think about that.  When Bitcoin has gone up over 100%, for 12 years straight, it's never gone down.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:16:32):**  And everybody goes, well, it's volatile.  Well, it's gone up 100% every year that it's ever been in existence.  Whenever you have something that has gone up 100, you can't name anything close in the  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:16:43):**  history of man that has ever gone up that drastically and had that stability.  People say it's volatile.  No, it's not volatile.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:16:51):**  Even if it is volatile, everything is volatile.  And whenever you're in a first mover adoption period of new innovation of technology, or  money, monetary systems, anything's going to be volatile.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:02):**  You have you have to have adoption periods, you have to have and just understand it and  you have to have education, you have to have on ramps, you have to decrease friction to  be able to get into that asset.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:14):**  When we get gold, what do we have to do?  We have to dig into the ground.  We have to mine that goal.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:20):**  That takes proof of work that takes moving earth to get there.  The concept of Bitcoin is the same way we just use technology to mine that Bitcoin.  Once a Bitcoin has been established, there will only be 21 million Bitcoin ever mined.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:36):**  There are over 200.  I don't know how many millionaires across United or across the world.  There's only going to be 21 million Bitcoin ever mined and that will never change.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:46):**  You cannot ever change that fact because it is based on a decentralized protocol that  has no center point.  It flows like water down a mountain.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:17:56):**  You can't control it.  It's going to flow through the internet, through the satellites, through all the wires.  So if you have a protocol that can store monetary value in it, it is basically the new network  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:18:07):**  that will move forward in our lifetimes.  And whenever the internet was created, it didn't have monetary value.  We had to build layers upon layers upon layers of banking, transactional services, being  
**[0:18:22-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:18:22):**  able to shop online, software, e-commerce.  Everybody just thinks that, oh, you could always use Amazon.  I remember when Amazon came out, it took years to be able to have people to have confidence  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:18:37):**  to shop online.  Now it's second place.  Same with Bitcoin.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:18:41):**  It's just new technology.  People don't understand it.  I went through the first phases of the dot com boom and bust in online software.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:18:49):**  People didn't understand what we were innovating now, but it set the standard and it pioneered  into where we are today.  So as a form of store value where you can actually have a certain dollar amount of Bitcoin.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:19:03):**  Okay.  Well, if you know how to manipulate, basically have not manipulate maybe how to take ownership  of your Bitcoin, you can use that as a store of value.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:19:17):**  You can leverage off of that store of value into something that you've never had access  to.  You can become your own bank and nobody can do anything about that.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:19:26):**  Bitcoin is property.  That's how the SSC, everybody looks at it.  People don't understand that it's like buying land in the new internet.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:19:37):**  So if you, if you own two blocks, let's say this, if you, Michael sailor said this once,  if you would have purchased two blocks of land on fifth Avenue in Manhattan, before  Manhattan was Manhattan, you would have never sold that two blocks of land.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:19:52):**  When they started building on it, you would have had property on some of the most expensive  real estate in the world.  If you own that two blocks of land, you've never sold that land.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:20:02):**  You've built on top of that land.  You built businesses, you've built properties and it keeps on stacking up.  And I, and that granite that is Manhattan, that is that two blocks in Manhattan is the  
**[0:20:15-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:20:15):**  same thing as what Bitcoin is in the new networking apparatus that the world is moving into.  So whenever you can own two blocks of land in Manhattan, you're going to have some leverage  and you're going to have banking access that you've never had before.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:20:31):**  This is coming and it's no different from how people use gold.  And it's how people use land in the United States, especially in the state of Texas,  because most of Texas is private property.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:20:42):**  So you bought up land a long time in Texas, a long time ago in Texas, you leverage that  land for your value.  You leverage that land to acquire more cows, leverage that land to buy equipment.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:20:55):**  You leverage that land, grow crops.  You did a lot of things with that land.  Well, that was the store of value.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:21:02):**  Well, that store of value is not in the land anymore because the land is valued in fiat  currencies, which is just out of control.  You know, you have a ranch in the Texas panel up here, that's worth $200 million.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:21:14):**  Well, that's all they're going to value that land for.  And that heritage of that ranch, that is, that is almost criminal for what, you know,  it should be.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:21:24):**  And I think people are going to see within land ownership and with ranching, with farming,  they're going to start using the Bitcoin protocol to store that value again.  It's going to give them a path into some leverage that, like I say, they've never seen.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:21:40):**  It's going to help them kind of create a legacy or maintain the legacy that got them there.  Okay.  So these proof of work blockchains, they've been under fire over the last year, 18 months  
**[0:21:56-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:21:56):**  during times of COVID for energy use, like big data centers that, you know, I guess for  lack of a better term, do the cryptography hashing to mine the blocks.  A lot of times that requires a lot of electricity.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:22:13):**  And I understand that that's, you know, different blockchains and different cryptocurrencies  have different energy requirements.  So what would you have to say to somebody that's concerned about, let's just pull one  
**[0:22:25-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:22:25):**  out of the hat, burning fossil fuels to make electricity to mine Bitcoin?  You know, I hear a lot of that stuff.  There's only one blockchain and it's Bitcoin.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:22:36):**  Everything else is a cryptocurrencies or nothing more, but copies of Bitcoin protocol that  are centralized apparatuses that do not flow through a decentralized network.  That's where people get very confused.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:22:48):**  So we'll talk about Bitcoin and Bitcoin only, as far as not understanding the energy usage,  that'll probably be more responsible to it.  What it is as far as the energy usage, sure.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:23:00):**  I mean, there is energy uses to power the miners in Bitcoin.  Okay.  Well, people put it out of perspective because they watch CNBC and they watch these news  
**[0:23:11-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:23:11):**  channels that really don't do much except manipulate and propagandize.  A lot of the Bitcoin mining that's being done these days is being done across the world.  And a lot of that energy that's being used is renewable energy, solar energy, hydroelectric  
**[0:23:27-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:23:27):**  energy, energy that's basically going to get wasted if it doesn't get used.  And so we're not burning tons and tons of fossil fuels to mine Bitcoin.  See that's number one.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:23:40):**  There's where the conversation should start.  It's like, let's talk about how much energy usage it's actually using that it's being  stolen from any other form of cities or areas, nation states or anything like that.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:23:53):**  That is just a false.  That's a false reality in a lot of people's mindsets.  If you're using this energy, what you're doing is you're creating monetary value as you're  
**[0:24:04-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:24:04):**  mining that Bitcoin, a monetary value that goes up in time.  So that energy, that electricity is transferring itself into monetary value.  Whenever we use fossil fuels now, when we go dig for gold, you think about the fossil  
**[0:24:23-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:24:23):**  fuels that are digging for gold.  Nobody puts a number on that now, do they?  And so you look at certain industries that are out there, the ones pointing fingers at  
**[0:24:34-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:24:34):**  Bitcoin miner, well, they're the ones that have gotten this position within fossil fuels.  Half of them probably drive electric cars anyway.  Right.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:24:43):**  And you know, what electric cars is just, it's, yeah, they'll be there and it's great.  Good luck.  It's not sustainable in the long period of time.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:24:54):**  But let's go back to fossil fuels.  The thing people understand is as Bitcoin evolves, people are, let's say El Salvador,  they're using volcanic, volcanic steam to mine Bitcoin.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:25:08):**  They're taking something from the earth and they're turning it into monetary value.  That monetary value is going to a base layer of value for that nation.  Okay.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:25:17):**  That's a very good use of energy.  It's a very good use of electricity.  You're not going to see anybody in the middle of, you know, certain places in a large percentage  
**[0:25:27-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:25:27):**  of mining, be in the middle of freaking New York, mining Bitcoin.  They're going to be in rural places where you don't have to bother the environment.  All you're doing is using basically what the earth is giving us.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:25:41):**  You're not causing a bunch of pollution.  And what you're doing is you're turning that energy into monetary value.  That's a good kind of introduction of understanding of it.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:25:51):**  And as mining moves forward in the kind of the mindsets of people, I'll give you an example.  There's some Tennessee ranchers that got natural gas mined.  Okay.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:01):**  They got natural gas mines.  What are they doing with that gas that was just being wasted?  That was just going into the atmosphere.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:06):**  They're turning it into electricity.  They're mining and they're turning that mining into monetary value, which is letting them  leverage that mining into more value into their cows.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:19):**  So what are they doing?  They're transferring energy.  And that's what we do with our cows.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:26):**  That's all cows are.  They're energy, their energy, their land tools.  And what they do is they rebuild our soil in ways that people don't understand and is  
**[0:26:35-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:35):**  being assassinated out there in the general public and the global media marketing campaigns  that are going against me.  So once people started understanding energy transfer, how we create energy and where carbon  
**[0:26:49-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:26:49):**  and all this, the argument against carbon and that we're climate change and what's causing  the climate change, there's so many lies out there and people are going to realize that  the energy that we really need are those land tools rebuilding our soil.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:06):**  I would agree 100% that we need to get more cattle back out on the land full time and  maybe reevaluate some of these high energy farming practices that we've evolved and use.  I'm not terribly familiar with the Texas Panhandle.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:26):**  Never really traveled through it very much.  Most people just travel through it.  It's flat land.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:32):**  It's the great plains.  I went through about a week ago down highway 54 through just cut through the North West  corner of the Panhandle through Dumas and Dalhart.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:43):**  Sure.  It's kind of a depressing part of the world.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:47):**  It's the great plains.  It's like Siano, Estacado.  The last place that the Comanches were, it was the land of the Comanches.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:27:58):**  We have Palo Duro up here and it's the second largest canyon in the United States.  That's where the Comanches hide out.  It's a very rugged part of the world.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:28:08):**  Like I said, it's on top of the Yano Estacado.  You can go 200 miles and be parched.  And it is, you got to have a level of toughness to make it up in the Texas Panhandle.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:28:19):**  I think white men would go 200 miles and be parched.  The natives wouldn't have any trouble.  Now the Comanches kind of knew what they were doing.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:28:29):**  They had that mastered.  Have you ever read the book Empire of the Summer Moon?  No, but I remember the title, but it's been a couple of years since I've heard it, but  
**[0:28:40-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:28:40):**  you can familiarize.  It's an amazing book and it talks about the Comanches.  It starts about some of the history of the Comanches and I think five, six or seven different  
**[0:28:52-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:28:52):**  like bands that made up the tribe and where they came from.  And like you said, Lano Estacado, that was one of their last strongholds.  The book also kind of takes you through, I guess it goes through the story of Kwanah  
**[0:29:07-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:29:07):**  Parker, one of the last great Comanche warlords and like how he came to be because he was  actually the son of a white woman.  Cynthia Parker.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah.  I couldn't remember the name.  Thank you.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:29:21):**  She was kidnapped when she was like eight years old by the Comanches.  Yeah.  And she stayed with them so long that she forgot her English.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:29:31):**  And when she was quote rescued by the white people, she just wanted to go back to her  family, which, you know, I suppose is totally understandable, but I think it's worth noting  that the Comanches were noted for their ability to cover ground on a horse.  
**[0:29:49-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:29:49):**  The cavalry troopers at the time, you know, 1830s, 40s, 50s, they were lucky if they could  make 25 miles a day with their ponies because all the supplies they needed in the Comanches  would ride 200 miles in a night, do a raid and then ride 200 miles back home.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:05):**  Exactly.  What a lot of people don't understand is, you know, when Texas was forming and it was  a lot of Comanche wars that took place for years, but the Texas Rangers found out exactly  
**[0:30:17-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:17):**  what you said, because everybody were soldiers and they ride, they had equipment and everything.  Texas Rangers found out as the only way we're going to defeat the Comanches learning how  to fight like the Comanche.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:28):**  And what that was was true horsemanship and how to fight from your horse instead of getting  off your horse and, you know, taking position and everything.  They were very versatile.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:38):**  So the Comanches could actually shoot like 10 arrows within like 10 seconds.  And they were masters at that.  Well, the Texas Rangers, guess what came along the Colt five shooter.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:50):**  So all of a sudden the Texas Rangers had 10 bullets.  And so let the games begin.  And then they became the six shooter, of course.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:30:58):**  And the Colt pretty much saved Texas back to them from, you know, in battling the Comanches,  because there were no matter what anybody says about anything, the Comanches were, they  were true warriors.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:31:09):**  They were fighters and they were savages.  They did a lot of things in the state of Texas.  You know that that happened.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:31:15):**  Cynthia Parker, she, they always say that she was kidnapped twice once by the Comanches  and then once backed by the Texas Rangers.  You're correct on that.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:31:25):**  Quanta Parker was a very intelligent man.  He basically bridged the gap of, you know, what, what happened during the 1870s.  And he was the peace between the white man and the Comanche.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:31:37):**  He saved that tribe in its history.  So his, uh, his hometown or where they like to call it as Quanta it's up here in the Texas  panel.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:31:46):**  He has a museum and everything.  I'm not for sure because you know, nobody really knows where a lot of these tribes were  even back in the 1830s, forties and fifties, all the research that I've done, I'm kind  
**[0:32:01-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:01):**  of about the Northeast part of the range that the Comanches ever raided into mostly up here.  We had more of a tribe, uh, called the Kiowas.  Sure.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:12):**  The Kiowas and Comanches actually share a reservation down in Southwest Oklahoma.  They fought a lot together.  They definitely did.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:21):**  They were, they were partners whenever they had to be partners.  I wonder, you know, worse happened because of lack of communication.  Pretty much all conflict happens because two parties just haven't been able to communicate  
**[0:32:36-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:36):**  through mutual desires to each other.  You got to wonder, you know, what, what the native civilization would look like if we  would have just stopped at the hundredth meridian and said, Hey, yeah, we screwed up.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:49):**  You guys can just take the rest of this and live and let us have California and Oregon  because we've already got a bunch of people by there, but y'all can just have the rest  of the middle.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:32:59):**  I help it wonder what that would have looked like, but I have no idea where to even start.  Well, I mean, if you'd have had that type of system that would actually let a nation  be sovereign, then, you know, that's, you know, that would be something that if allowed  
**[0:33:12-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:12):**  to be the native Americans would have been just fine.  We would have never destroyed this land as we've have.  And, you know, that's just the truth.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:21):**  I mean, we know that we wouldn't have hunted the Buffalo to extinction, which we couldn't  meet the Comanches.  We couldn't beat the Comanches, the Kyle was the seven tribes that were still left out  
**[0:33:32-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:32):**  here.  We couldn't beat them even with superior weaponry, even after, even after the civil war and all  the military innovations that came along with that, we still couldn't beat them.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:41):**  No, we had to starve them out in a lot of ways, you know, had to take away the food  supply.  And isn't the, isn't that what happens to nations is that whenever they're under full  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:51):**  control, their food supplies get taken care of.  Seems to be a pattern, doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:33:58):**  And the history of man, you know, didn't the Roman empire fall because there were too many  people on welfare, depending on the state to feed them.  And they had sure.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:34:11):**  Couple of years of drought and crop failure.  Yeah, that's what happened.  Well, they, they quit putting as, you know, as far as the, the gold coin of the Roman

You know, they started devaluating the gold.  When that happened, the food started becoming very devalued as well.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:34:27):**  And a lot of it became free and it was something that lost its value as far as quality of food  towards the end, you know, they would give out free bread, tell you to go to the column  SIM, you know, don't worry about it, go watch people kill each other.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:34:42):**  And you know, there's nothing to worry about.  Watch your entertainment, eat as much as this free bread as you want.  And as a society that does that, when it becomes when the food becomes devalued, it devalues  
**[0:34:55-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:34:55):**  your society in the pillars of strength that your society is in.  And that's what we're going through right now, because people look at our food industry  and they say, oh, we got plenty of food.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:04):**  It's not food.  It's industrial sludge, man.  It's poison.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:09):**  And, you know, it's built to make you addicted to it.  It's a drug now.  And nobody, you know, we're going through a level of denial in this country about, you  
**[0:35:18-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:18):**  know, the problem of the lack of nutrition that we're consuming every day.  So how do you solve that?  Well, you do something like the beef initiative and you get people looking back at what pure  
**[0:35:29-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:29):**  animal protein is, how it came to be, how we got here with your pure animal protein  and how we need to move forward with that mindset.  And with that intentionality of knowing that this is the only way we're going to save our  
**[0:35:43-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:43):**  communities is to be powerful based on a very strong form of nutrition.  I saw something the other day.  The American diet was designed to put you in an American hospital run by American healthcare.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:35:58):**  So you can see, you can take drugs made by American pharma.  Well, all right.  This is what it's called.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:36:06):**  It's called the medical pharmaceutical agricultural complex.  Okay.  You look at that chart and you, in my sub stack, I've got plenty of charts and you look  
**[0:36:16-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:36:16):**  at and you can see the companies.  And what it is is, okay, the medical pharmaceutical agricultural complex is owned by the same  global corporations.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:36:27):**  Your food is, is, is allowed.  You're allowed your food supply through a chemical company that is in charge of your  seeds.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:36:36):**  It's in charge of your, uh, the seeds, your, your agriculture, everything that you do in  aggregate, not you, but a lot of people that bow down to the umbrella of, you know, the  impact is, you know, it's controlled by chemicals and chemical contracts.  
**[0:36:52-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:36:52):**  Whenever that is the control apparatus of your food supply, your nutrition and your  food is a second thought.  I mean, we're talking major global profit margins and companies and conglomerates and  
**[0:37:03-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:03):**  control and power over that civilization.  And you know, food, I've, I've met a very intelligent man that was in the industrial  food complex for many years.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:14):**  He was very successful in it and he got out of it, but he basically, this man knows what  he's talking about.  And he said, our food supply is nothing more than a global marketing plan.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:26):**  That's all it is.  Anything else if they want to, if they want to change the ingredients in your food, if  you're eating frozen burritos, or if you're eating taquitos, if you're eating out anything  
**[0:37:36-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:36):**  at frozen, you know, if they, if they need to decrease the amount of protein, they can  do that.  They can, they can say, Hey, beef and being burrito.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:46):**  All right.  If they say beef and bringing it's 50 50.  Well, you know, in a couple of years, it could be basically 95% beans that are GMO beans  
**[0:37:56-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:37:56):**  and 5% beef.  And you still would not know because they get to put fillers in there.  And then those fillers tastes like beef.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:38:03):**  They put thousands upon thousands of chemicals in our food industry that make us think that  it's tasting a different way than it should.  They do the same thing with dog food.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:38:13):**  So whenever you have a food industry that basically leads with a chemical that makes  you manipulate your taste buds, you don't know what food is anymore.  There's a whole industry devoted to flavor science to making chemical crap tastes like  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:38:28):**  something in the real world.  I'll tell you what, there's a company called roll DSM.  Look them up.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:38:34):**  They basically control 90% of people's perception of what food tastes look, tastes like.  I think they generated over $9 billion in 2021 alone.  And so whenever you have a chemical company, that's a global company that designed tastes  
**[0:38:52-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:38:52):**  for anything on the planet, and they're going, they're going full steam ahead now with fake  meat and other fake commodity products.  You better learn where your food comes from and you better quit paying attention to the  
**[0:39:07-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:07):**  marketing plan.  And you better go out there and meet guys like you, Brian, that basically are growing  and producing and putting some, basically some heritage, some education, some intentional  
**[0:39:18-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:18):**  agency into your lifestyle.  So you can provide food to your local communities.  That is really, why would you not do this?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:28):**  You know, what is the excuse that people use?  We've always done it this way.  Why do we need to change all that regenerative crap won't work.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:36):**  That's voodoo.  That's a short period of time of our food supplies.  We've known it as human beings.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:42):**  What we've seen is a really, you know, less than a hundred years, and really you can look  at 50 to even 40 years of how our food has changed dramatically.  This is a small blip on a radar that is much fast, much bigger, has so much proof of work  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:39:57):**  behind it.  And it's going to have a hell of a lot of proof of work in front of it because the regenerative  is going to happen.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:03):**  And it's not that it's not going to change the population of the United States or even  the world.  What it's going to do is you're going to have a percentage of people that understand what  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:13):**  food is, and they're going to be pretty powerful because they're going to be stronger.  They're going to be healthier.  They're going to use less health care costs.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:20):**  They're going to spend less on food in the long term.  They're going to have good relationships with people like you and their local producers  and suppliers and processors.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:30):**  And they're going to have confidence in their life and their life is going to be more successful.  They're going to make better decisions.  They're going to have better relationships.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:38):**  And they're going to understand that they don't need to be looking at these marketing  plans anymore because they're false and they are lies.  And they get away with it.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:47):**  That's fine.  They can go do all that stuff.  Like we said in the beginning, this is not about talking about all those companies.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:40:53):**  We're moving beyond that because we're going to provide new solutions.  So how do you feel about feedlots?  Man, feedlots have a place.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:03):**  It's really not the feedlot basically.  And this is where, you know, I spoke with somebody the other day, the sacred cow, Diana  Rogers.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:13):**  Okay.  She wrote, okay.  I talked to her and she's, you know, it was a short conversation and I hopefully I get  
**[0:41:18-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:18):**  to talk to her more, but we have to look at this whole industry and we can't, we can't  look at it as black and white right now.  We want to point our compass in the direction that goes into a regenerative way right now.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:32):**  We've got to reform the speed lots.  A lot of feedlots are reforming.  They are going non GMO.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:38):**  They're looking for better solutions.  They're giving better space to feed those or finishing off those cows.  So whenever you say feedlots and you say, you know, feedlot finishing grass fed grass  
**[0:41:50-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:41:50):**  finished grass fed feed, finished grain finished.  We need to look at where we stand as individual, as a producer, and how are we moving in the  direction where we can get out from underneath the umbrella of control that is going on right  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:04):**  now.  If we look at this too much as a, as a very black and white issue, we're going to fail  within the industry.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:11):**  We have to be okay with where we are and saying, we're all going to work together.  We're going to start communicating.  I've got a rancher down in central Texas.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:20):**  He's developed a damn good protocol that does grass fed and then he finishes off on non  GMO grain and he's getting that non GMO grain and he's getting it from very good sources  that it is trusted and it is verified.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:34):**  And so there's a protocol there for, you know, a customer base that wants grain finished  because of the fat content.  You know, everybody has their preference, you know, grass fed grass finishes very lean,  
**[0:42:46-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:46):**  you know, and it's a different type of meat.  Some people not are going to like that.  So it's really the education of the individual saying, what am I going to accept?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:42:55):**  What is my knowledge base where I can understand that I'm not going to get these chemicals  in my body.  Once you, the individual start with your education and your knowledge and you go talk to your  
**[0:43:05-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:05):**  ranch or you're going to be able to make your desk, your best decision based on your relationship  with him and his protocol, you know, like going to you and your protocol is going to  be different than somebody down in the pan Texas panhandle.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:18):**  You know, where we go through droughts, 10 year drought sometimes, and you bet we're  going to have to use some grain at times, but we're going to look at that grain and  see what kind of grain it is.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:29):**  Drought is real.  It's it is it's settled in over the last couple of months.  There's yeah, it's here.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:34):**  It's here.  I can't ignore it any longer.  I mean, not that I've been ignored, been watching the signs and yeah, winter moisture just hasn't  
**[0:43:41-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:41):**  come.  So yeah, we're like spring.  I mean, we've got a couple of snows here, but we haven't hit, we haven't seen winter  
**[0:43:49-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:43:49):**  like we get.  And so we're going to go straight into a windy spring and wind in the Texas panel.  You want to talk about dehydrating the land, take our all humidity out of anything.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:00):**  It gets pretty parched here.  High fire danger too.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:04):**  Long term drought means, you know, the heavy fuels, the hundred and thousand hour fuels  and all this invasive, all these invasive trees we've let grow up from basically where  I am to where you are.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:16):**  Right.  A lot of junipers planted as shelter belts, elm trees.  You know, I don't elm trees, hedge trees, everything.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:24):**  You know, for all of those that you say, you know, you get all that up here and you know,  like between you and I, yeah, that's what that's out spread out.  You know, and we've been seeing it since, well, last six years.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:39):**  You know, drought, you know, climate change, climate change is real.  Whether or not we can agree, man is having an effect on that.  The climate is changing.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:51):**  Mega wildfires, not just here in the plains.  You know, everybody's heard about the ones in California, the ones in Colorado, the ones  in Montana.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:44:57):**  We've had some pretty, pretty good size fires here too.  You guys had several down in Texas, Panhandle kind of like, you know, more Eastern Panhandle  kind of close to Oklahoma around Canadian, but I remember.

It's decades of poor land use management period.  Whether we're talking about here on the plains or whether we're talking about the forest  
**[0:45:21-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:45:21):**  in California or the wild land urban interfaces in Colorado.  I mean, it's absolutely tragic that you had a neighborhood of over 150 houses burn up  in an afternoon.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:45:33):**  So, maybe we should look at where we're trying to build our houses and maybe we should manage  some of those areas better.  Maybe we need to start looking at where we're living on the plains and understand we're  
**[0:45:44-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:45:44):**  an environment that evolved with fire.  Like fire is a natural fact of life out here.  And just like their understanding out in California with decades and decades and decades of, you  
**[0:45:55-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:45:55):**  know, the forest service policy, every fire must be extinguished, no smoke by 7am the  next day.  That's kind of the standing order.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:46:03):**  We've had that mindset for a long time and I think it's kind of come back to bite us  in the butt because we've got a lot of these dead heavy fuels that are just building up,  building up, building up.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:46:14):**  And it doesn't take much to get them started.  One of those dry, dry, windy days, like you can get the panhandle, we get them up here,  40, 50 mile an hour wind, 75 degrees beginning of March.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:46:25):**  That is a perfect recipe for an absolutely horrific wildfire.  And I can only imagine what some wildfires would have been like before we built all the  roads and railroads and shot the Buffalo.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:46:41):**  I mean, there would have had to have been some wildfires that make anything that we've  seen on TV in the last five years look like a fricking girl scout campfire.  Yeah, it'd be kind of laughable.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:46:54):**  I mean, you've seen the pictures of the Dust Bowl, right?  You know, where it's just a black cloud.  That's what the fires were probably like as well.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:02):**  You know, it came in like that because you traveled with the wind.  That's exactly what they look like.  I've been under that smoke twice.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:11):**  We had one here in the Texas panhandle.  I think it's been about 10 years ago.  You can look it up.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:15):**  I think on Texas Monthly did a pretty good piece on it.  It wiped out a lot of land up here.  It was pretty savage.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:21):**  A lot of people, some people lost their lives.  A lot of cattle lost everything.  So moving on to some other ones.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:34):**  My good friend Hobbs, who just moved to Texas from Oregon, he's down around Lufkin.  We were talking a couple months ago and he said, money is the language of energy and  carbon is the currency of the ecosystem.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:47:53):**  How does that grab you?  Carbon is say again, carbon is what?  Carbon is the currency of the ecosystem and money is the language of energy.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:03):**  Pretty much.  I mean, we're on a petrodollar, right?  They're turning our whole economy into a carbon credit economy.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:10):**  So you know, there's a lot to be said that, you know, money is energy.  Then, you know, Bitcoin is energy.  It's just transferred energy.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:19):**  You know, that's what money is.  You don't get out of bed without basically exchanging money during the day.  Everything that you're doing right now is so you use your energy.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:30):**  You dispel that energy into something that you feel is valuable.  That basically that exchange rate is that dollar bill right now.  And you give that to somebody else, they take that energy from you.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:41):**  Then they go off and do something so they can do the same thing that you just did.  That is a transfer of energy and a monetary value way that is money as we know it.  So you look at carbon, I mean, how they're going to leverage carbon and how the lie of  
**[0:48:56-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:48:56):**  carbon is going to be manipulated as far as a carbon credit economy, because they're going  to make the cow basically a carbon hazard.  That's what they're doing on a global front now.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:49:06):**  So they find out your MasterCard finds out that you're eating steak, you're going to  lose your carbon credits.  And if you're going to play the carbon credit game, you know, you're going to end up being  
**[0:49:15-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:49:15):**  basically in the long run, a bad citizen.  They already have this thing is called a social credit score in China.  And I've done a lot of damn research and whatever the everything that's going on with this carbon  
**[0:49:26-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:49:26):**  credit economy is going in that direction.  It's a form of identifying you as an individual and saying that you're bad for the economy,  you're bad for the environment.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:49:36):**  And once you get that implemented into your type of profile, as we all have a profile  with it on our banks and our government, then you will be looked at differently.  And this is where all this is going with carbon.  
**[0:49:48-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:49:48):**  So yeah, carbon, he's right in a lot of ways.  You know, there's some programs out there that are paying ranchers, that regeneratively  graze for carbon sequestration on their grasslands.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:01):**  That's a big argument right now.  Do we take advantage of it and really show them how to do it?  Or is there a protocol built into that carbon sequestration that basically the government's  
**[0:50:12-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:12):**  going to be able to take control over your land in a long way and do some type of seizing  that they've done in the past?  This is going to be, we're going to find out, I don't know where this is going and I don't  
**[0:50:23-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:23):**  know who's going to do it, but I've heard from both sides is yes, we're going to do  this and then no hell no, we're not even getting close to it.  I've signed up with grassroots carbon and have you?  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:34):**  Yeah, suppose they should be coming to measure sometime soon.  TM.  Right.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:41):**  I'm on, I'm at the top of the list to come get measured and certified.  So, well, then that's, that's going to be good to know because I want to bring that  in, you know, because as far as being within the beef initiative, you know, we have to  
**[0:50:53-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:50:53):**  be, we can't be judgmental here.  We got to bring your intelligence in.  Let's have a conversation about it so we can get it out there and say, Hey, yeah, this  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:00):**  is effective or stay away from this.  You don't want to go here.  We have the rancher that's gone through this process.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:07):**  That center point of communication is what we're, we're hoping that the ranchers, you  know, with our, the relationships that we're trying to establish with the ranchers, that  that's what we can do.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:18):**  Let's have this discussion.  Let's talk about it.  That's the smartest thing to do.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:22):**  Yeah.  I've heard the argument about, you know, Oh, I don't need the government telling me how  to farm.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:27):**  Right.  Maybe somebody ought to come give you a little bit of advice every once in a while, because  you're doing the same shit that you guys have been doing on the same dirt for 60 years.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:34):**  Maybe you could try something different.  But the carbon program that I'm in, it's all third party.  It's not a, there's not a government certification or government program that's tied to it.  
**[0:51:49-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:51:49):**  It's all, it's all voluntary through third party, which is why I'm involved with them.  If I thought there was a chance that the government was going to be able to come, come tell me  how to do anything.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:00):**  I wouldn't do it.  I don't even go to the NRCS or FSA office very much anymore, just because I don't even  want them to know what I'm doing.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:08):**  Right.  What about this?  Do you know the, the company you said it's grassroots is who it is.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:13):**  Do we, do we have a, do we have a company, global corporate profile on who's, who's originating  this funding for these things?  I'd just like to know just well, grassroots is kind of how to wish CK was here.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:26):**  Cause this is actually her job.  Right.  Nope.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:30):**  No problem, man.  It's complicated.  Grassroot is basically the broker.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:35):**  Okay.  So they're functioning as the broker and they're using a, another third party to do the measurement  and the verification.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:44):**  So let's just say Joe's oil company comes up and says, I need a sequester.  I need a hundred thousand carbon credits.  They say they go to grassroots, say grassroots.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:52:56):**  I need a hundred thousand carbon credits.  So grassroots goes down through their file of ranches that they've measured and does  the math acres, tons per acre over a year and says, okay, here we go.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:53:05):**  And they put together a block of land that will be sequestering that carbon over the  next several years.  Sure.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:53:12):**  So, and, and they represent several, um, they they're functioning as that for several, uh,  carbon credit buyers.  Whenever they were in, in, like I said, this is going to be a conversation that's ongoing  
**[0:53:25-0:53:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:53:25):**  whenever they do that, what type of technology that they make and you use what type of metrics  and measuring mechanisms and stuff like that.  Are they using, are they doing anything with your cows?  
**[0:53:36-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:53:36):**  Are they doing anything with, uh, you know, as far as tracking, digitizing things that  haven't been digitized before?  Mostly I think they're taking like your past management history into account to see what  
**[0:53:49-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:53:49):**  you've done on the land.  And then they come out, like the measurement process is they come out and they measure  several cores in each soil type is what I've been told.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:00):**  And they take a three foot core.  Okay.  So we're not just going to measure the surface carbon.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:05):**  We're not just going to measure down to a tillage line at the same time every year,  they're going to measure three feet so they can measure how my deep rooted Prairie plants  are storing that carbon deep in the soil.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:18):**  And they're not going to measure the same time every year.  They're going to wait three to five years and come back in a different season, or maybe  I had that wrong, but they are going to wait at least three to five years and then come  
**[0:54:28-0:54:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:28):**  back and measure it again.  And the initial measurement gives them an estimate.  And then they on, on what that land will store per year.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:39):**  And then over the term of the contract, they're watching how, how you're managing your land  and they come back towards the end and they measure it.  And then that's, that's when either the big payoff is or they go, Oh, well, we shouldn't  
**[0:54:51-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:51):**  have signed up this ranch.  Right.  Well, you, cause the reason I asked these questions, cause there's a lot of things that  
**[0:54:58-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:54:58):**  are going on with this type of carbon movement.  And in, you know, I've got a pretty good team that kind of looks behind the curtain as much  as you can just kind of see where the funding is coming from all of this.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:55:11):**  Cause there's so many damn, you know, there's companies out there that act like they're  the, they're the best thing since, you know, a hormone free cow, but you know, that, that  funding is coming from bill Gates, you know, so what is his motivation here, you know,  
**[0:55:25-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:55:25):**  when he's trying to kill the meat industry.  So we always just look, you know, a little bit deeper than a lot of people are basically  told probably in the beginning, as far as where everything's coming from.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:55:37):**  I like the idea if it is definitely something that's going to help the regenerative movement  to get some leverage, you know?  And if I was going to get those carbon credits, you know, I'd say it right now, I'll say it  
**[0:55:47-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:55:47):**  on camera.  If I'm going to be part of that program, I'd any benefit that I got from there that has  monetary value, I'd be putting into the Bitcoin protocol and saying, you bet.

And I'm going to leverage it into this store value that is legal.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:56:07):**  And thank you.  That would be the smartest thing in the world to do.  So how does a rancher start taking capital that they have or capital or equity that they  
**[0:56:18-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:56:18):**  can access and borrow against to start transferring some of their value store into Bitcoin?  Sure.  It's hard to kind of get started in Bitcoin if you don't know, you know, what's going  
**[0:56:30-0:56:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:56:30):**  on as far as the on-ramps and the ways to basically acquire Bitcoin and to basically  store it and have self custody to where you truly own that Bitcoin.  You know, you have seed phrases, you have hardware wallets, you have, you have multi  
**[0:56:45-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:56:45):**  SIG companies that do a lot of stuff to help you make sure that that's Bitcoin is yours.  Okay.  You got to explain it like I'm five.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:56:53):**  Sure.  Well, what we're going to do for the people out there, as far as the ranchers that have  no clue, I'm a, I have a concierge service that we're going to, we're already moving  
**[0:57:01-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:01):**  forward with it right now.  We started it this week in Texas.  We're going to go to the rancher and we're going to educate you like a major investment  
**[0:57:09-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:09):**  firm company would do.  And we're going to teach you about Bitcoin.  And we're going to say, this is the best protocol that we've developed for the rancher that  
**[0:57:17-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:17):**  wants to start using Bitcoin as a store of value.  Somebody that wants to use it, accept it as a form of payment.  We're going to be able to educate you on that.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:27):**  If you want to have a five-year plan with Bitcoin, we're going to say, okay, this is  what we're kind of recommending.  And we're going to give you a, basically a roadmap that you can follow and it'll be an  
**[0:57:40-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:40):**  ongoing education process.  That's going to be big for the beef initiative.  We're building teams across the regions that will be able to educate the rancher instead  
**[0:57:49-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:57:49):**  of watching YouTube or anything like that.  You know, during my conferences, I'm having four conferences this year as well.  I'm having, um, one I'm having in Kerrville, Texas on April 23rd and 24th.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:03):**  We're going to have speakers.  We're going to have education.  We're going to have regenerative people there.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:07):**  We're going to have ranchers there.  We're going to have Bitcoin investment people.  We're going to have a lot of different types of speakers at these conferences that anybody  
**[0:58:15-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:15):**  can come to and kind of understand beef and Bitcoin.  So by saying that each conference that we have across the United States, the education's  going to grow.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:25):**  And if you know, if you like today, tomorrow, if you want me to get somebody to start talking  to you about Bitcoin and how you can start understanding it better, well, we're going  to give you a really good kind of foundational understanding and how you can start leveraging  
**[0:58:39-0:58:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:39):**  it for yourself because each rancher and farmer is going to be totally different.  It has many different uses and it's not a blanket approach.  You have to really kind of understand it and you need somebody there.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:58:50):**  And what's going to be cool about that is you, the rancher gets to educate beef initiative  as your protocol, what you're doing with your beef, your animal protein and how you're doing  it and looking at it.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:01):**  So it's a value for value.  You know, we're not charging anything for the Bitcoin education.  This is something that we want to be partners with all the ranchers so we can basically  
**[0:59:11-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:11):**  decrease that friction that is there, especially in the financial institution system that controls  all of us.  Let's, let's kind of step up and give a white glove approach to the ranchers so they can  
**[0:59:23-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:23):**  better understand and they don't have to worry about people scamming them because they have  enough of that already.  So you know, we're going to establish really good relationships with the rancher and just  
**[0:59:32-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:32):**  do what we can to help them better understand.  I could probably safely speak for most ranchers and say, we're pretty much sick and tired  of people taking money from us and giving us terrible advice.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:45):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's, it's criminal.  It is.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:49):**  And it, it sucks because you want to be a rancher.  Damn it.  That's what you're good at.  
**[0:59:53-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=0:59:53):**  You shouldn't have to have that paranoia and that corruption surrounding the industry in  a lot of that corruption is from the global or the corporate or the United States government,  you know, under the umbrella of the USDA of the FDA, there's so many things that you guys  
**[1:00:09-1:00:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:09):**  have to be paranoid about that change like that, and that you have to be ready for the  next year, every 13 months, there's something new that's coming down the pipe that you've  got to think about as you're battling drought, as you're battling, you know, um, lack of,  
**[1:00:23-1:00:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:23):**  you know, grasslands, whatever it is, as far as sources for your land tools, you know,  there's so many things that you, you guys don't have time to come in here and say, okay,  I understand Bitcoin.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:32):**  I'm a master.  There's, that's just not possible.  You need help.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:36):**  Just like we need help with our food.  It's a, it's a, it's a win-win for both sides.  For sure.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:44):**  So what do you think about what's going on up in Canada with the, uh, trucker convoy?  You know, I it's, I think it's wonderful of course, just because people are exercising,  you know, you know, stand on their own two feet and make their own damn decisions again,  
**[1:00:58-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:00:58):**  instead of being told what to do and told that you have must comply to everything that  the TV tells you to do.  One thing that I think is very important, that's going to come out of the truckers and  
**[1:01:07-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:07):**  this is going to build, we don't know where it's going, but just the, them being able  to seize $9 million and seize the bank account of, uh, the, the charity, the, the donations  that were given to the truckers.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:20):**  You're talking about that go fund me thing where they, they skated the money and said,  well, we don't like their costs.  So we're not going to give it to them.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:26):**  We're going to give it to people who we, yeah.  Yeah.  And people think that's an isolated event.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:33):**  Guess what?  I had a rancher here in Texas that his bank account got seized because they said you valued  your Cal wrong.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:39):**  He didn't have access to his capital.  Guess what fixes that?  What guess what fixes that up?  
**[1:01:44-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:44):**  Guess, guess how many millions of dollars in Bitcoin that the truckers are now getting  and nobody can stop this now, you know, why?  Cause it's peer to peer money exchange.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:01:54):**  And so those truckers are going to get that $9 million are probably going to get a hell  of a lot more.  And the whole world's going to start understanding Bitcoin a little bit better because they're  
**[1:02:01-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:01):**  going to say, Hey, the government can't seize this Bitcoin.  And in that respect, it's more like cash that the government doesn't need to know what I  spend cash on unless I tell them.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:12):**  Nope.  But if it goes through the bank, now, if you put it on your debit card or you use PayPal,  Venmo, or any of these other payment apps that are go through the conventional banking  
**[1:02:23-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:23):**  system.  Yeah.  The government knows that.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:26):**  Sure.  I don't, I, after all the revelations of Edward Snowden, if you, if people don't think that  the government can't look at every single detail of their lives at a whim, they're living  
**[1:02:40-1:02:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:40):**  in a fantasy world.  Like they're not watching all of us.  Like they can't watch all of us.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:47):**  They can only watch a very, very small percentage of us, but believe me, if they wanted to,  they could find out every single detail about you.  And it's scary.  
**[1:02:55-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:02:55):**  Well, what's going on.  Let's look at that.  Why do they, why do they basically seize more and more control of the monetary system?  
**[1:03:04-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:04):**  Why do you have, well, the reason they do that is because it's so devalued.  Once it's devalued, you have to control something more and more and more to make it look like  it does have value.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:17):**  That's what's going on here.  The United States dollar has lost tons of value.  We can't even say how much value it's lost.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:24):**  You can't even quantify it right now.  And they've proven that free money to anything you want to do, you get free money.  Well, once you accept that free money, you're going into a database, you're going into a  
**[1:03:34-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:34):**  new surveillance system and that's, what's going on with the COVID, you know, that's  why, you know, vaccinations, you're in a database.  Now, if you ever got tested for COVID, you're in a database.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:44):**  Now it's just how it is.  That's just the truth.  So, and they will use that in their ways that they do.  
**[1:03:50-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:03:50):**  And so as far as, you know, identifying each individual across the world and the Western  world, which is going on right now, they will be able to have access to those people that  comply in certain ways.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:02):**  Well, you don't have to comply to everything.  You don't have to break the rules to not comply.  And so with using Bitcoin, Bitcoin is property.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:10):**  I'm transferring property to you and you're accepting it.  And that's what we agreed to do.  And if you never, if you never cashed out that Bitcoin, you would never have to pay  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:19):**  tax taxes on it.  Yeah.  I don't have to face a Bitcoin.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:23):**  Yeah.  It's unforeseen gains.  You cannot tax for something that you've never spent money.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:30):**  You've never profited off of it.  So what do you do with Bitcoin?  You save it.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:35):**  That's what I do.  I save Bitcoin in the long run.  I'm never touching my Bitcoin.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:39):**  What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to a bank that already exists in this world,  very many of them.  And I'd say, I got this much Bitcoin.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:47):**  Give me, give me a half a million dollar loan.  If I have enough Bitcoin, they're going to say, sure, here it is.  I never have to touch that Bitcoin.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:54):**  Guess what?  That's what they used to do with land.  It's no different.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:04:58):**  We live in a digital world.  And for people to deny the fact that we live in a digital world, you're, you're falling  behind.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:05):**  Our cash is digital now.  And so let's leverage the digital world in a way that's never been done in a decentralized  way that cannot be confiscated from you.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:14):**  It cannot be confiscated from these truckers that will give them more power to stay and  do what they're doing right now.  If it was all cash, they would shut down every bank account they could have every one of  
**[1:05:24-1:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:24):**  those truckers.  But now they're, guess what?  They have a new leverage tool that has a store of value that people are waking up to.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:32):**  That makes sense.  So I've been seeing a lot of chatter on social media the last couple of days about a USA  freedom convoy.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:45):**  It looks like it's going to happen.  Three or four weeks, it might take a while for everybody to get things organized and  people to get supplies and routes planned out.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:05:55):**  But I think it's going to happen here.  What do you think?  How many trucks, what percentage of trucks do we need to stop moving to really collapse  
**[1:06:06-1:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:06:06):**  supply chains?  I think that's something that you have to look at the geography of the United States.  Like where I am, you've got North and South interstate systems.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:06:18):**  So to keep products and goods and services into this part of the country is pretty easy  because it's always a pass through North and South, East and West.  And so by saying that, the Texas Panhandle will be pretty taken care of in a way because  
**[1:06:32-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:06:32):**  we have the localization, we have the processing plants.  There's a lot of things that we can actually control pretty much locally.  A lot of the country, a lot of different places will be suffered.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:06:44):**  I'd say about 40%.  If they can get 40% of a disruption within our supply chain lines with the truckers,  they would have a very big impact.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:06:54):**  And people would say, what's going on here?  Oh, I haven't been paying attention.  Maybe I should be looking to my local communities.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:07:01):**  It's pretty strange, the lack of coverage that those protests up in Canada have gotten.  It just blows my mind.  You won't find it on the news networks, but you've got to go to social media and you kind  
**[1:07:14-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:07:14):**  of have to look.  Well, if people don't realize that media is controlled by less than 10 corporations globally,  and they think that CNN and Fox News are any different from each other, come on over and  
**[1:07:28-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:07:28):**  I'll give you some education because the media companies are pretty much at this point in  time, if you're mainstream media and you're going through a centralized media control  apparatus, which they all have to, you're going to not report on the news anymore.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:07:46):**  You're going to report on what they tell you to report.  And there's very few people that actually do provide very good and actionable and truth-based  news anymore.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:07:57):**  So I haven't had a TV on in over two to three years.  I don't watch the news.  I don't even, I'll pick and choose what I get to watch and what I want to see, because  
**[1:08:07-1:08:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:07):**  if something's going down, I'm going to know about it.  And it's going to come from a lot smarter, smarter sources than watching that TV of propaganda.  They call it programming for a reason.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:18):**  Programming your brain.  Of course it is.  That's what we do.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:21):**  We, we, we, we allow ourselves to be programmed.  I think if a lot of more people, if they became their own mind filters in our society, a lot  of people would get a lot more happier and they would look within a little bit more.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:33):**  And they look within their local communities instead of looking out with all this distraction  that's going on in the world, that's not benefiting their lives, but it's taking time away from  them.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:44):**  Whenever you have to process all this bullshit that they're doing, you're not processing  things in a positive way for your family or for your, you know, your, your, uh, local  community.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:08:55):**  You're worried about things that are not going on.  Once you have secured your local community and you know who you're working with, then  you can start looking out and everybody says, you know, let's look at food.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:07):**  That was that we got to feed the world.  No, we don't.  We got to learn how to feed local communities.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:12):**  That's how you feed the world.  And that's it.  It doesn't go any further than that.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:17):**  And if it does, if you have that opinion that it doesn't start with your local communities,  and this is how we solve starvation.  And when this is how we replace shitty nutrition with very good nutrition, then you don't understand  
**[1:09:32-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:32):**  how things have survived throughout the time and history of man.  It's not about a population control here.  This is about local communities that work together.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:40):**  It is as simple as that and not like me and you talking right now, this is what this is  about.  Local communities, community supported agriculture, shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:09:53):**  What are some of the other good ones I've heard?  Know the face of your farmer is another great one that, uh, all the time you mentioned,  uh, the previous conversation we had, you wanted to put, uh, how many packing plants  
**[1:10:07-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:10:07):**  in the state of Texas?  Well, the big overall goal would be, you know, to shoot big, right?  We have 254 counties in the state of Texas.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:10:17):**  So you know, that's a lofty goal to say what we really want to approach in the next decade  here is to get one processing center, basically never a three or four County range towards  it starts out as a good regional co-op of processing animal proteins.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:10:33):**  Um, what the processing division of the beef initiative is doing right now, um, we are  going to be a consulting advisory board, whatever you want to call it.  We're still looking at the language, but you're going to be able to come to the beef initiative  
**[1:10:49-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:10:49):**  and we're going to be able to consult with you.  And the reason I'm able to say this is I have people in the processing industry in the state  of Texas that have been doing it a very long time.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:01):**  We have a lot of information now that has USDA precedents from processing centers, all  the way from, let's say 2000 a day, all the way down to one a day.  If you want to Abattoir, if you want to be a butcher in your local community, you're  
**[1:11:14-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:14):**  going to be able to come to the beef initiative.  We're going to say, okay, these are the specs of the USDA and the state of Texas and the  state of Texas rules.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:22):**  We will work with you and we'll get you started.  We're going to have access to capital funding.  We're going to have all kinds of different ways that you can get started, communities  
**[1:11:31-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:31):**  can get started.  Maybe it's church space, who knows whatever can come up with the capital and create a  processing facility in a region in which their county lies.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:42):**  That's going to be our goal.  And I'm pretty excited about it because it kind of came to head pretty fast.  And I have a K K and C cattle, coal down in Austin.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:11:55):**  He's a, he broke ground on his processing center.  He's going to shoot for about 200, 250 a day.  Justin up here in the Texas pan now, he just opened up, he passed all his inspections.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:12:06):**  He now has USDA, Preston's the head inspector of the state of Texas came to his inspection  and gave a speech and said, this is what we want in the state of Texas.  So there is a movement a foot and there's capital behind it.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:12:20):**  And now we have the intelligence of the processing industry in the state of Texas, which a lot  of people will be able to use across the nation.  We'll get you as far as we can until the state rules and regulations, but then we'll also  
**[1:12:33-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:12:33):**  be able to help you with that because of the connections that we have.  And so we're going to be working with politicians.  We're going to be working with people that have been in the industry for a very long  
**[1:12:43-1:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:12:43):**  time, and they know that we have to scale down and we're going to end up knowing the  rules and the laws sometimes better than the law and the rules know themselves because  it's a very detached organizational structure as far as regulations, this hand talking to  
**[1:13:00-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:00):**  this hand in the government.  So we had, when I say precedents, we have these things saying, Oh, back in 19, let's  say 99, this was a ruling that happened in the state of Texas to where we have precedents  
**[1:13:13-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:13):**  here.  This is how it's going to be done in the state.  We'll go, okay, that you're right.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:17):**  You are correct.  So we're going to be able to provide that type of intelligence that people can have  confidence in because a lot of these processing centers, let's give an example, Justin doing  
**[1:13:28-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:28):**  30 cows a week.  Okay.  He has to meet regulations on a processing center.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:34):**  That's 2000 head a week.  Okay.  Or a day even.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:38):**  So there are, well, there's sanitation rules and regulations would actually not that make  that processing center on 30 cows a week, even you can't compete.  And so therefore you get costed out of being able to open up your own processing center.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:13:55):**  Well, we've got, once again, we've got precedents to where we can scale your center into your  facility, into the size that you want to shoot for, being a butcher, local butcher, or it  be somebody like Justin doing 30 a week.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:14:08):**  So, and that's never, I don't think that's ever been done and it's going to be, it's  going to be a fun year putting all this together, but we're going to start, you know, helping  people out as soon as possible.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:14:20):**  So any plans to expand in other States?  I mean, you said you'd help folks in other States and a theme that keeps coming up and  a question a lot of people usually have is, well, how scalable is it?  
**[1:14:31-1:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:14:31):**  Well, that's not always a question of scalability.  It's a question of replicatability because we don't want one big thing.  We want a bunch of little things that are benefiting communities.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:14:40):**  So how well does beef initiative replicate to other areas?  Well, I think it's, I think that's the strong point of the beef initiative.  You know, I first started out as the Texas beef initiative and that's because it's Texas,  
**[1:14:52-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:14:52):**  right?  But you know, it's so beyond just Texas.  In Bitcoin, you have what we call decentralized nodes basically that run on a lightning network,  
**[1:15:02-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:02):**  you know, and what that is, is we can look at it at the communities across the United  States, as far as the beef initiative.  There's going to be a, there's going to be a New Mexico beef initiative.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:12):**  There's going to be a California beef initiative.  There's going to be a Kansas beef initiative, Oklahoma beef initiative, Florida beef initiative.  We already got guys putting together a Missouri beef initiative.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:22):**  And so what we'll do is we'll help out everybody we can in each state to get going like what  we've done in Texas.  There's no reason we shouldn't be doing this.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:32):**  And so once we get that, we can start these conferences where everybody can come together.  We can share this information and as a decentralized way of sharing information that becomes very  powerful, very fast.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:44):**  And especially if we're approaching the processing, the producing, the supply and the market access,  this is something people don't talk about.  We got to create the market access to how do we create market access?  
**[1:15:57-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:15:57):**  We create all these small communities together, knowing each other, saying, this is what we're  doing.  This is how we're doing it.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:03):**  And if we need to ship across state lines, well, we can do it in Texas.  Maybe you can't do it in Kansas.  Well, we'll help you out.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:10):**  So we're going to begin those conversations.  And what that does is it identifies the restrictions, the leverage that we can use and the conversations  that we need to have.  
**[1:16:21-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:21):**  So this is a national thing.  The beef initiative is going to be, we're going to change the beef industry and we're  going to ask for everybody's help.  
**[1:16:32-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:32):**  And I've been doing this by myself.  I've funded this.  I'm not out here getting corporate money at this point in time.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:38):**  We will get funding.  We will do this.  But right now, this is about saving children's lives.  
**[1:16:45-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:16:45):**  This is about bringing communities together, hyper localization of our food systems, saving  children's lives, which ties into food as medicine, which ties into food intelligence.  And maybe we should say the loss of food intelligence, because it seems like since we've had the  
**[1:17:09-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:17:09):**  USDA come out with dietary guidelines that our health as a society has done nothing but  decline.  And I feel like that they've built upon the great lie that fat is bad and sugar is okay.

Like they can't go back and say, well, maybe this stuff that we've been teaching it for  70 years is wrong.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:17:40):**  Sugar's what's really killing us and giving us cancer.  And to that extent, refined grains that the body turns immediately into sugar, aren't  that great for us either.  
**[1:17:50-1:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:17:50):**  Maybe we should go back to eating like our ancestors ate and eat a lot of meat and some  vegetables.  Well, you know, that's what they should do.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:17:57):**  They're not going to because they're too far, like you said, they're too far gone with this.  The only way this is going to change is by the individual making those consumption choices.  They're going to have to look in the mirror and say, why do I desire what I desire when  
**[1:18:09-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:09):**  it comes to food?  What is my level of education, intelligence level of food and what it is?  You're right.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:16):**  It's a lack of food intelligence is what's got us here.  It's been so manipulated to where, you know, taste buds are the deciding factor of how  a child learns what food is.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:26):**  That's dangerous.  And that's completely exploited.  Forty six percent of our children right now in the United States, between the ages of  
**[1:18:34-1:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:34):**  five and 11, or obese or overweight, and they're on the way to diabetes, five and 11 year olds,  that is criminal.  And people need to quit acting like it's not happening.  
**[1:18:47-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:47):**  And they need to quit denying the cause and effect of this.  And it is from highly processed foods.  It is from highly refined sugars.  
**[1:18:56-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:18:56):**  It is to chemical companies designing our food systems.  And if they can change if they want.  But you know what?  
**[1:19:04-1:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:19:04):**  I'm not going to pay attention to them anymore.  I'm not going to validate their existence if I don't have to.  And that means I'm not going to buy their product because I have very good relationships  
**[1:19:15-1:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:19:15):**  with local animal producers and produce producers.  So all this comes together.  It becomes very symbiotic.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:19:25):**  I don't care what the food industrial complex is doing anymore because I'm pretty secure.  And everybody that's listening to this, everybody across the United States, if they make that  same decision, they won't have to worry about this food supply shortages.  
**[1:19:38-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:19:38):**  They won't have to worry about their kids being overweight or obese.  And they won't have to be worrying about having a heart attack when they're 58 years old,  because they're not going to believe the lies that fat animal fat is bad for you, that eating  
**[1:19:52-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:19:52):**  and consuming canola rapeseed, you know, in every food product that you eat is actually  good for you.  It's not good for you.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:00):**  It's poisonous.  And that's people need to realize that.  How are seed oils poisonous?  
**[1:20:06-1:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:06):**  Well, you know, the level of engineering it took to get seed oils into something that  is basically consumable was fascinating.  1956 FDA outlawed rapeseed for any form of human consumption.  
**[1:20:20-1:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:20):**  Okay, let's go back from there.  Because in the rapeseed is canola for right.  Yeah, there you go.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:27):**  FDA, you look it up, Google it right now.  1956 FDA rapeseed, and you'll get the report.  So you look at that.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:36):**  Let's go back a little bit further.  Okay, Procter and Gamble.  Okay, Procter and Gamble was a candle and soap chemical company founded in 1837.  
**[1:20:47-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:20:47):**  Okay, come turn of the century, they basically sold a lot of damn candles because we didn't  have electricity when the United States of America basically started using electricity.  Procter and Gamble had to find a way to use all that cotton seed that they were using  
**[1:21:01-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:01):**  to make the candles and so they turned that into Crisco.  So you started consuming your candles.  It's the same stuff that was in those candles became what you're frying your chicken, whatever  
**[1:21:14-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:14):**  it is this.  That's how the seed oil started with the with the consumption side of it in the United States  on a big scale.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:23):**  And planes why Crisco burns really well.  And yeah, it's a lot of light.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:21:28-1:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:28):**  Nice and slow.  But if you look at that, just starting there, Procter and Gamble and how they got into Crisco  and how it all started in the to where we are now, you know, with canola, rapeseed,  
**[1:21:42-1:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:42):**  I mean, that thing is a weed man.  It's poisonous is they they found science, they were able to engineer a way to take out  the acid and to take out the poisonous sides of it.  
**[1:21:55-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:21:55):**  But for you to your body to have to digest that type of chemical that will run your car  in the engine and just as good as motor oil.  And you're okay with eating like tons of that throughout your lifetime.  
**[1:22:09-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:09):**  You need to see what food is.  I'm sorry, it's not it's, you know, lard.  You know, we use lard lard tallow, you know, that's what we came here with.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:17):**  And there's, you know, that's what happened with Vandal keys.  You know, he came out with a very good marketing plan and all these studies saying that cholesterol  was going to give you a heart attack.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:28):**  And that kind of narrative started after Dwight D. Eisenhower had a heart attack in 1954.  And they said, Why did our president have a heart attack?  And so they focused on cholesterol.  
**[1:22:38-1:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:38):**  They didn't bring to the fact that Dwight D. Eisenhower smoked four packs of cigarettes  every day too.  You know, it's funny how all these truths never get told and how it evolves out.  
**[1:22:52-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:52):**  We're on a roll.  Sure.  I got to go recycle some coffee.  
**[1:22:55-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:55):**  Can we take a quick break?  Yes, not a problem.  All right.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:22:58):**  I'll be right back.  Oh, we're back.  I had to recycle a little bit of coffee.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:23:05):**  So what I was just thinking about is a couple of weeks ago, I was talking to my friend,  Gail Fuller, and he was talking about glyphosate.  And we're talking about food intelligence.  
**[1:23:18-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:23:18):**  We're talking about, you know, being more aware of what you put in your body.  I'm of the opinion.  Now, like I said, my opinion that we're spraying these crops with these antibiotics, with these  
**[1:23:33-1:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:23:33):**  herbicides or these pesticides that basically you just kill everything else that we don't  want to live.  And we're feeding these grains and I'll just say, for example, corn and soybeans are the  
**[1:23:46-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:23:46):**  two biggest offenders.  We're feeding this corn and soybeans that's been grown with all of these herbicides and  pesticides and antibiotics.  
**[1:23:56-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:23:56):**  We're feeding these to our food supply.  And the cows eat them.  I can't help but wonder if there's some biological effect that, quote, science has totally missed  
**[1:24:10-1:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:24:10):**  that happens to the biology of these cows when they're eating so much of this engineered  grain.  And there's also compounding factors in there a lot of times, right?  
**[1:24:20-1:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:24:20):**  Like a lot of feedlot cattle are implanted to maximize gains.  Okay.  And they always want to make the argument that it's a financial decision.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:24:31):**  Well, if we don't do it, we're going to lose money because everybody else does.  That's not how I want to do business.  But they're also feeding.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:24:39):**  A lot of times they feed, they give antibiotics as prophylactic.  And I can see where that makes a lot of sense.  And I can also understand why they don't want to tell anybody.  
**[1:24:50-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:24:50):**  But the point I'm making is when you can find these animals in these feedlots, there's a  lot of antibiotics being used.  There's a lot of questionable feed being used that you don't always know where it came from.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:04):**  You don't always know what it was sprayed with.  My cattle, if you want to know what they've eaten, I'll tell you.  I'll show you.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:12):**  So do you think that maybe there's some of these chemicals that are in our food supply  that are building up in our bodies and causing some long term health effects?  Yeah.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:23):**  I mean, I think that without question, that's what's going on right now.  Glyphosate, it's Roundup.  So what do you do with how many years was Roundup brought to the forefront that it was  
**[1:25:41-1:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:41):**  causing cancers?  They settled for billions of dollars and all that recently.  That's what happens whenever these chemicals get into our bodies and they have a class  
**[1:25:52-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:52):**  action lawsuit.  So nothing really ever changes on this.  If it's not glyphosate, it's going to be some other.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:25:59):**  There's thousands upon thousands of chemicals that are getting into our systems because  they're following that brain process and procedure as far as the very beginning of that seed.  The beginning of that seed has been manipulated from the very beginning.  
**[1:26:13-1:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:26:13):**  In the labs, they've manipulated it to only grow if it's used in this certain way.  And that's what the farmer and the rancher have to sign is that technology use agreement  basically saying, I will grow this grain.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:26:26):**  I will use these pesticides.  I will use these herbicides in the way that you tell me so I can have a cash crop and  I can have better yields.  
**[1:26:34-1:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:26:34):**  And then, you know, those yields go get transferred into that cattle that is eating that grain  that was raised by the herbicides and the pesticides and genetically modifying its organisms.  You damn right all these chemicals are getting into our systems and they're getting into  
**[1:26:50-1:26:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:26:50):**  our children.  There's so many things that you can do as far as scientific reports.  You can find it.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:26:56):**  Just do research on Roundup and health, you know, health issues caused by Roundup.  Let's talk about all that herbicides and pesticides getting into our water systems.  You know, even even if you don't ever eat that cow, you don't ever eat that grain.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:27:13):**  You're still getting that that poison into the water systems in your local communities  that are doing these mono crops, growing all of these fields.  There's no way around it.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:27:24):**  These chemicals are getting into our tissues and they're getting into our kids.  And we're seeing things.  I have a doctor that that I talk to and I say this a lot on the different podcasts I  
**[1:27:36-1:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:27:36):**  do.  She she looks after teenage boys in the state of Texas.  She says that there is an epidemic of teenage boys testosterone levels and they're showing  
**[1:27:45-1:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:27:45):**  up as 200 teenage boys with 200 T cell counts.  That should be way over a thousand.  Our boys, our boys are becoming asexual because they don't have any testosterone.  
**[1:27:57-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:27:57):**  Well, let's flip it over to the to the women, to the females.  Well, they're becoming basically where they can't have children at a younger ages.  And there's been studies that it's the glyphosate that is chemicals that are causing infertility.  
**[1:28:12-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:12):**  So the all the information is out there, but people refuse to go see it for one.  Maybe they don't know how to obtain that information because everybody thinks that, you know, Google  is the Internet.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:25):**  So there's a lot of them, a box on the TV can't make it a 20 second soundbite.  Pretty much.  I mean, that's a high time preference way of living in sourcing your information to  
**[1:28:35-1:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:35):**  where it's instant gratification.  It's the quick fix.  It's the dopamine.  
**[1:28:39-1:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:39):**  And here we go and here we go.  And then it's on to the next one.  All the information's out there.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:44):**  It's not a big secret.  It's just that nobody pays attention to it because, you know, the food tastes good and  that's all it matters because it's been engineered to make you addicted to it.  
**[1:28:54-1:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:28:54):**  So you're not going to question it because you're hungry over four hours because you're  eating a type of food that's make you hungry every four hours and makes your pancreas and  your insulin levels go through the roof.  
**[1:29:04-1:29:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:04):**  You know, diabetes is a maintenance illness or you know how much it costs average across  the United States for somebody for diabetes per month or nine type one or type two type  two let's go type two.  
**[1:29:17-1:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:17):**  Right.  Because because type one, I mean, they're they're kind of it's manageable.  Well, yeah, it's not brought on by our diet.  
**[1:29:22-1:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:22):**  Right.  It's manageable and all kinds of stuff.  Type two diabetes is caused by our food.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:29):**  It's just that simple.  So nine hundred dollars a month flat rate just for insulin for every American in the  United States to battle with diabetes.  
**[1:29:40-1:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:40):**  You can't get over most type twos.  You're not going to go over it.  One thing you can do is you can how many hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people have  
**[1:29:48-1:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:48):**  changed their lives by eating pure animal protein that were once borderline diabetic  or were diabetic.  And you know that that's just facts.  
**[1:29:57-1:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:29:57):**  But you're not going to see that you're not going to get these reports because diabetes  is waking the pharmaceutical companies way too much money.  And it's it's why would they change that?  
**[1:30:07-1:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:07):**  Why would you get companies are sponsored by the pharmaceutical company?  And they all own the congressman.  There you go.  
**[1:30:14-1:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:14):**  Impact medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural complex.  They're all talking to each other.  They say, OK, I got this food product over here.  
**[1:30:23-1:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:23):**  OK, we're going to release this food product.  Well, what chemicals can we put in that food product?  Because the FDA just said we can put a thousand new chemicals into the food system this year.  
**[1:30:31-1:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:31):**  Nobody knows that.  It's called the grass rule.  Generally recognized as safe.  
**[1:30:35-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:35):**  So a thousand new chemicals are going into our food system this year.  So we've got the food supply that's affected.  We got the chemical companies that are making money now pharmaceuticals.  
**[1:30:44-1:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:44):**  Well, we've got this type of pharma, this prescription now that we can actually battle  that what's going to be caused by these chemicals.  Do you think that they're not talking to each other?  
**[1:30:53-1:31:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:30:53):**  Lock, step and barrel on all of this.  If you don't think that that is happening, you really don't understand the system and  what you're you're living in.  
**[1:31:02-1:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:02):**  I would agree with that.  Even doctors don't understand it.  It's the same in most the same in everything that the institutions have been captured by  
**[1:31:14-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:14):**  corporate interests.  Sure.  And the politicians have been captured by corporate interests.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:20):**  And the longer these congressmen and senators stay in there, you know that insider trading,  there was some, Nancy Pelosi about a month ago was kind of used for insider trading and  she was trying to defend it.  
**[1:31:38-1:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:38):**  Well, if you or I did that, we'd be in jail.  She'd been doing it her whole career.  It's nothing new.  
**[1:31:43-1:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:43):**  I mean, she's rich, man.  She manipulates every quarter.  So you got to wonder how many how many senators and politicians have gotten extremely wealthy  
**[1:31:55-1:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:31:55):**  in the last two years off their investments in Moderna, Pfizer and J&J?  Well, you're starting to see some people.  So I mean, it's not hard to see.  
**[1:32:03-1:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:03):**  It's public information.  It's just people don't go look at it and people don't have the attention to expand.  You know, they just they don't put a lot of low time preference into that education of  
**[1:32:12-1:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:12):**  saying this is this is very broken.  And this is how it is affecting you.  And it is affecting our lives.  
**[1:32:19-1:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:19):**  And that's why we have to start with food.  You know, that's why we have to look at food first above anything.  Because if you start with the source of the seed of the corruption of the of the seed,  
**[1:32:28-1:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:28):**  then echoes, it goes to money, it goes to politics, it goes to chemical companies, it  goes to global corporations, you know, one thing it does not go to, it doesn't go to  those cattle behind you in your in your picture there, it goes, you control that access to  
**[1:32:43-1:32:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:43):**  that energy and to that value, because you're not using the chemical companies, you're not  using the medical corporations, you're not using the pharmaceutical, you're not really  using the agriculture in a way that a lot of people are.  
**[1:32:55-1:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:32:55):**  So you don't have to really worry about that you're doing it right.  And a lot more people want to learn how to do it the way you're doing it.  That's not going to be able to be stopped.  
**[1:33:05-1:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:05):**  One thing that you know, is is a bottleneck is acts, you know, getting that land, you  know, getting access to you can't have the land, though, why don't you have a relationship  with Brian, why don't we go out here and have a relationship with him.  
**[1:33:17-1:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:17):**  In that way, we can at least be as close as we can, and we can get educated.  Like I said, in the beginning, why would a person not do that?  It's rewarding.  
**[1:33:26-1:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:26):**  It's a value add to your life.  They wouldn't do it because they don't know it's available.  Right.  
**[1:33:32-1:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:32):**  And that's the here we are, you know, here's the beef initiative.  Let's all do this together.  Let's make this crowdsourcing.  
**[1:33:38-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:38):**  Let's make this a collective.  This is how things get changed.  They don't get changed on the political level.  
**[1:33:46-1:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:46):**  Politics follow what the community says they should do.  If they don't listen in the beginning, they listen whenever there becomes a collective  that becomes the majority saying you're not getting in the office again.  
**[1:33:56-1:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:33:56):**  Okay, if you don't start listening to your constituents.  So you know, I'll work with any politician across the United States right now, if you  want to have a talk with the beef initiative, because I'm going to come and talk to my local  
**[1:34:07-1:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:07):**  representatives.  I'm going to leverage the United States government and the state government in every direction  that I can.  
**[1:34:14-1:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:14):**  And I'm going to have a team that's going to look at every part of every legislation  that's been passed, we're going to, we're going to join forces with the farm and ranch  Freedom Alliance.  
**[1:34:22-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:22):**  It's very poor powerful organization here in the state of Texas or down in Austin.  You know, we don't have to put up with this manipulation anymore.  And that's what I want to bring as far as that confidence to people.  
**[1:34:34-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:34):**  It's hard for the rancher that's out there 20 hours a day trying to, you know, survive  and trying to raise the meat, the protein, you need people like me doing the beef initiative,  the people that want to be part of the beef initiative to help you.  
**[1:34:48-1:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:48):**  And that's what I want all these all the ranchers across the United States knows, we're here  here to help.  We're here to form a new form of communication that we've never had before.  
**[1:34:59-1:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:34:59):**  Our grandparents knew how to decentralize their their communication, they had the two  party or the party line system, they knew who they were going to exchange, you know,  half their cow with that year, or half that hog with they knew part of their produce was  
**[1:35:12-1:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:12):**  going to these families in this market in the town square.  So this is this is what we're doing.  And we're bringing it back.  
**[1:35:19-1:35:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:19):**  But we're using the digital world to do it.  And it's very possible.  And it can be very powerful.  
**[1:35:25-1:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:25):**  And it's going to be very powerful.  Okay.  So how exactly does does Bitcoin tie into beef initiative and your whole vision?  
**[1:35:37-1:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:37):**  Bring it all back to the 30,000 foot view.  I just tell everybody, you're going to have a new store of value that your grandparents  or you never thought you were going to have, you're going to be able to leverage that store  
**[1:35:48-1:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:48):**  of value.  If they're building fake land in the metaverse, we're going to have a store of value that  basically nobody can touch.  
**[1:35:56-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:35:56):**  And you don't even have to tell anybody about it either.  Because if you never cash out Bitcoin, you don't have to claim it.  You don't have to just say anything.  
**[1:36:03-1:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:03):**  It's an investment just like anything else.  It's a piece of property.  That's what it is.  
**[1:36:08-1:36:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:08):**  And once the once the rancher understands, I said this on Marty bent last week, I said,  you got a rancher that's been doing this for 40 years.  And he understands everything that's thrown in him as far as manipulations from futures  
**[1:36:22-1:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:22):**  to commodities, to grain prices, like we've talked about before everything a rancher has  to do, it has to navigate through every year.  Once we get him educated and understanding what truly the store of value and the leverage  
**[1:36:35-1:36:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:35):**  of Bitcoin, you think a lot is not going to go off in that rancher's head that he's going  to say, Holy shit, I didn't think about this.  And he's going to have a team there saying, let's help you.  
**[1:36:46-1:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:46):**  Let's get let's save your legacy.  Let's build your legacy.  Let's do this together.  
**[1:36:52-1:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:36:52):**  And that's what's going to happen thing about big corners.  We're not asking for money.  That's the thing about people don't understand we don't have to because we leverage Bitcoin.  
**[1:37:00-1:37:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:00):**  We're trying to help and save a food industry here.  And so it's not about LARPing.  It's not about having a marketing plan.  
**[1:37:06-1:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:06):**  So I can go out and get rich real quick, has nothing to do with it.  It's about saving our ranchers and saving our farmers.  And we're asking them to trust us right now and to try it out.  
**[1:37:17-1:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:17):**  Let's have a conversation.  Bring us your questions.  And we'll help answer those questions.  
**[1:37:23-1:37:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:23):**  And in the meantime, you're going to educate us on your protocol on how you're raising  and how you're saving the land, how you're raising your produce, how you're supplying  it, how you're processing it.  
**[1:37:35-1:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:35):**  And guess what that creates a general sense of awareness across this country because we're  doing it locally, you know, local communities.  And that spreads that spreads like a virus.  
**[1:37:48-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:48):**  Hopefully not a virus more like a well, I'd about ready to say wildfire, but that's not  that great either.  Right.  
**[1:37:55-1:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:37:55):**  Yeah.  I guess I shouldn't say virus, but anything that that was a big scam anyways.  So but as far as it's spreading what it is, it's a form of communication that we need  
**[1:38:04-1:38:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:04):**  to leverage.  And what it is, it's a decentralized form of communication that is not going through  a centralized control apparatus.  
**[1:38:12-1:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:12):**  Right now we're using this type of system.  But guess what?  I mean, there's going to be things that get that happened on the Bitcoin protocol, the  
**[1:38:21-1:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:21):**  Bitcoin network that basically want to talk about decentralized communication.  It's coming.  Podcasts can be done differently.  
**[1:38:30-1:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:30):**  And there's going to be a different way of monetizing podcast.  It's already happening.  There's a lot of movement happening right now.  
**[1:38:37-1:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:37):**  Podcast 2.0.  There's a Bitcoin TV.  You know, these things are on a different type of protocol that people don't understand,  
**[1:38:44-1:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:44):**  but you're going to see a lot more of it coming your way.  Once the ranchers understand this form of communication that has monetary value and  is a store of value, they're going to think a little bit in a different direction.  
**[1:38:57-1:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:38:57):**  They're going to point their compass in a different direction just a little bit.  That's all we're asking.  Yeah.  
**[1:39:03-1:39:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:39:03):**  Okay.  So I was sitting here thinking about, you know, you keep mentioning Bitcoin is decentralized  and that it is a blockchain based decentralized ledger.  
**[1:39:15-1:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:39:15):**  Right.  And the way I understand that that works is every individual computer that's running the  hash software has its own copy of the complete blockchain.  
**[1:39:30-1:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:39:30):**  And it's creating these hashes to try to predict the next block or to verify the next block  in the chain.  And it's decentralized, which means there's unlimited copies of it.  
**[1:39:46-1:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:39:46):**  But then there's also computers who spend a lot of time comparing the change to each  other and agreeing which chain is the valid chain.  So in every transaction is recorded in chronological order.  
**[1:40:01-1:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:01):**  Do I have that?  I have that curve.  Yeah, that's a good view of it.  
**[1:40:05-1:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:05):**  Sure.  So as these different blockchains, you know, they all start in the same place and they  have transactions added on to them.  
**[1:40:13-1:40:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:13):**  And then the blockchains kind of merge and they figure out how everything fits together.  And then that copy of the blockchain propagates back out.  Is that pretty much, I mean, it's just a verification process.  
**[1:40:25-1:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:25):**  It's a ledger.  It's nothing more than a ledger that you basically can stamp your ownership on.  And if you wanted it protected, it can be spoofed.  
**[1:40:35-1:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:35):**  But to spoof it, you have to have so many computers making a different blockchain with  false information that it's just, it's not practical, mathematically possible, but not  practically possible.  
**[1:40:47-1:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:47):**  I love everybody that goes through.  Yeah.  Nation States going to attack.  
**[1:40:50-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:50):**  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we had a nation state attack against Bitcoin this year.  
**[1:40:53-1:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:53):**  It was called China.  You know, they, they, they, they did something.  They decrease the hash rate by 50%.  
**[1:40:59-1:41:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:40:59):**  Guess what?  Most people never even knew that happened.  So you're going to have to shut down a lot of damn hash rates.  
**[1:41:04-1:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:04):**  You're going to have to shut down a lot of different countries, you know, providing that,  that value of verification.  And we can sit here for the next 10 years and say, well, I just don't understand it  
**[1:41:17-1:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:17):**  because how can that happen?  Well, why is that a store of value?  Well, you know what, why is, who was the first person that started, uh, printing money?  
**[1:41:28-1:41:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:28):**  You know, who is that person?  Who was the first person that ever, you know, establish a gold coin, you know, let's look  at it in perspective here.  
**[1:41:36-1:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:36):**  There's a lot of millions and actually a trillion dollar getting close to, of course, this where  Bitcoin always hangs out.  You get a market cap that goes from a trillion to 10 trillion.  
**[1:41:46-1:41:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:46):**  There's your verification.  Okay.  And it's going that direction.  
**[1:41:50-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:41:50):**  Whenever you have a value of a society that does not have a store of value in its money  system anymore, people with a lot of money are going to say, where can I put this value?  A lot of people doing it in land right now, right?  
**[1:42:03-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:03):**  They're buying up a bunch of land.  A lot of people are doing it with real estate.  Well, what happens after real estate and land?  
**[1:42:09-1:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:09):**  Where are you going to put it?  Gold's not moving.  Gold's going backwards.  
**[1:42:13-1:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:13):**  Where are you going to put it in bond market?  Okay.  Gold's only going backwards in relation to the dollar.  
**[1:42:20-1:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:20):**  The dollar is losing value.  It's not gold that's losing value.  It's the dollar.  
**[1:42:24-1:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:24):**  Oh yeah.  But can you carry a, can you carry a million dollars worth of gold?  Uh, look at a million dollars worth of gold than a million dollars of cash.  
**[1:42:33-1:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:33):**  Okay.  Well, let's say this, but you can't carry it around your pocket.  You can't put that in a briefcase and carry it down.  
**[1:42:39-1:42:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:39):**  You can't even exchange gold.  Can you?  Most people that own gold don't even know gold.  
**[1:42:44-1:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:44):**  They own a gold note, right?  It's like the dollar is a note.  It's not gold.  
**[1:42:49-1:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:42:49):**  And so once you can prove that you own part of that network that only has 21 million Bitcoin  ever, and you can prove that, that you are the custodian, that you have ownership of  that part of the Bitcoin protocol, that is your value because there are going to be a  
**[1:43:06-1:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:06):**  lot of people say you damn right.  It's dry.  Let me have that Bitcoin.  
**[1:43:10-1:43:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:10):**  I'll buy it from you right now because you know what?  Cause the number's going to go up.  We're at 40 something thousand.  
**[1:43:15-1:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:15):**  We've been to 69.  Well let's just keep on watching it and we'll see what happens.  And it's never too late to get into Bitcoin.  
**[1:43:23-1:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:23):**  You don't have to own one Bitcoin.  If you've got a hundred dollars, that a hundred dollars are going to be worth more than a  hundred dollars next year.  
**[1:43:30-1:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:30):**  I guarantee you that a hundred dollars is not going to have any value if it's a hundred  dollars in cash.  And I guarantee if you've got a hundred dollars worth of gold, that a hundred dollars worth  
**[1:43:38-1:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:38):**  of gold is going to be doing about the same thing for you.  So if there's only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be in existence, how many have been  found?  
**[1:43:50-1:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:50):**  They say there's about 18, 19 that have been mined.  Really doesn't matter once it's all been mined.  What's out there is out there and the hash rates.  
**[1:43:59-1:44:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:43:59):**  You know, it'll, it'll basically prove and verify what's existed.  What's it, what's been kind of sleeping dormant might be gone forever.  Who knows?  
**[1:44:09-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:09):**  That's part of scarcity.  That's why they call it scarcity.  You know, whenever you can look at something as is scarce, we don't know.  
**[1:44:18-1:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:18):**  Let's find out.  It's some Y and demand economics at that point.  Pretty much.  
**[1:44:23-1:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:23):**  Isn't it?  So once people start understanding what scarcity is, cause we, what, what, what we have scarcity  of water right now, right?  
**[1:44:30-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:30):**  There's things that we know that are scarce.  How do we treat that?  How do you treat that as a rancher when water is scarce?  
**[1:44:36-1:44:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:36):**  It's very valuable, isn't it?  Okay.  Why wouldn't you treat Bitcoin, the new monetary system that has a store of value that can't  
**[1:44:43-1:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:43):**  be confiscated from you?  Why would you treat Bitcoin any different whenever you can transact it peer to peer and  it's completely legal and you don't ever have to pay taxes on it if you don't cash it out.  
**[1:44:56-1:45:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:44:56):**  That's an excellent point.  I mean, I'm all about not having to, uh, I'm all about avoiding giving the government any  more money than I have to.  
**[1:45:04-1:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:04):**  Right.  And you know, Bitcoin, Bitcoin's going to survive all these other cryptocurrencies,  all these Ethereums, they're going to get taxed and regulated in ways you don't know.  
**[1:45:15-1:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:15):**  And the government will get those because they're centralized protocols.  They're not decentralized.  You can't do that to Bitcoin.  
**[1:45:22-1:45:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:22):**  Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO.  It doesn't have a company.  It doesn't have a headquarters.  
**[1:45:28-1:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:28):**  What it has, it has a community of humans that said, this is going to have a store value.  Once you have that on a global scale and we have less than 1% adoption, what happens whenever  Bitcoin gets adopted 10% across the world out of 8 billion people, you want to talk  
**[1:45:45-1:45:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:45):**  about something that is a store of value that people agree on.  Well, guess what?  People start paying attention and they start putting a lot of intentional action into that  
**[1:45:53-1:46:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:45:53):**  protocol to protect it because no one it's protecting those cows.  It's protecting that land.  It's protecting your child's future.  
**[1:46:02-1:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:02):**  It's protecting your food supply.  It's protecting your time and space in ways that has never been done before.  It's somewhat complex, but if you can just go down the rabbit hole of education and have  
**[1:46:15-1:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:15):**  an open mind and turn off the FUD, whenever, you know, whenever I was in the dot com startups  and the, you had Google and you had Amazon that came out, do you know the amount of fear,  uncertainty and doubt that they did on those companies, Google saying it had no value or  
**[1:46:33-1:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:33):**  let's say Amazon, Amazon almost didn't happen.  Who the hell is going to read a book online?  You've heard all of this.  
**[1:46:40-1:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:40):**  Well, I'm not doing that because I'm not going to spend money online.  Gosh, I'm gonna have to use my credit cards.  Somebody's going to steal my information.  
**[1:46:47-1:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:47):**  You had all this fear and uncertainty and doubt with all of those media companies and  all these corporations that were causing this fear and uncertainty and doubt they were acquiring  Amazon and the arts of Amazon.  
**[1:46:58-1:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:46:58):**  They were quietly figuring out how to get their finger in the pie before anybody else  did.  And this is, this is called wall street and that's, I've seen it, I've lived it.  
**[1:47:07-1:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:47:07):**  I've been right in the belly of the beast of it.  Fear uncertainty and doubt is what they do to things that are going to win.  If it's not going to win, they're not going to talk any crap about it because they don't  
**[1:47:17-1:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:47:17):**  care.  What they do is they manipulate your mindset on what has value, what does not have value.  Bitcoin is the most valuable thing on this planet right now to leverage.  
**[1:47:28-1:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:47:28):**  And once you learn how to leverage it in a new way, that's never been done before.  It'll become the new, you know, it'll be, it'll, it'll be an awareness that's going  to help save a lot of people.  
**[1:47:40-1:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:47:40):**  Okay.  Hypothetically, you've sold me that Bitcoin is a good store of value.  Okay.  
**[1:47:46-1:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:47:46):**  How do I get started?  I'm going to, I'm going to have somebody call you and they're going to start doing the white  glove concierge service for you.

And I am going to, he's going to be very, very patient with you and he's going to start  exactly where you need to start and let's come back in one month and then we'll have  
**[1:48:04-1:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/52-Texas-Slim-Beef-Initiative--Bitcoin-and-Ranching--what-does-it-all-mean-e1ebn89#t=1:48:04):**  a conversation.  I'll make that deal with you.  I'll make you that guarantee.

Riding with me today is my co-pilot CK and today we've got my buddy Chad Tuttle from  C2C Ranch in Plainville, Kansas with us.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:00:59):**  Chad, how are you today?  Doing good Brian, how are you guys?  I'm doing great.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:05):**  How about you CK?  I'm doing awesome.  I'm so excited for spring.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:11):**  Getting some nice moisture.  It's fine, I agree.  Right?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:14):**  Yep.  We had some great winter moisture and things are starting to green up.  Are things looking pretty good in your part of the world too Chad?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:25):**  We had great moisture in March.  Had the one six inch rain and a couple of inches after that I guess.  So we're set on moisture as we've ever been.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:37):**  It's a slow spring so far I think.  It's had enough cool weather that we haven't seen a lot of green coming in or some green.  But as quick as a spring a some of us would have liked it.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:01:49):**  That's the way it goes.  Hopefully that will mean that the moisture lasts longer.  Alright so tell us about where you're at and tell us about your operation.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:02:00):**  Sure.  We're located north of Hays about 20 miles.  Hays Kansas which is out of the western part of Kansas.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:02:10):**  We have 2500 acres here.  It's all located in one block up on the Slane River mountain.  The Slane River that runs up through here is basically a year round river unless we  
**[0:02:21-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:02:21):**  get into a background.  It's a pretty good river.  We're very blessed in that we have some of the prettiest country up and down the river  
**[0:02:35-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:02:35):**  valley.  All of western Kansas.  We have about as beautiful a country as anybody.  
**[0:02:43-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:02:43):**  The ranch is a mile and a half wide from west to east but if the river flows through it  it actually makes a right hand corner and goes far to the south and then makes kind  of a peninsula and makes another left hand corner and then goes up a long limestone stretch.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:00):**  So we've got four miles of river most of which is bordered by beautiful limestone.  Very unique steaming.  Some of the people as they get here they get a little bit of a smile.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:13):**  Very true.  Originally we were a basic, regular, typical farm.  Very sweet corn, milo, and cattle.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:23):**  We tried to do it all in no-kill.  So gang, instead of restarting the whole interview we had some audio problems that we got worked  out so we're back with Chad and hopefully the audio problems are behind us.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:42):**  So now I think we maybe have the audio problems behind us and we're going to try to pick  back up with Chad.  Chad, sounds like you've got a beautiful place down there on the Saline River with  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:52):**  miles of river front and beautiful limestone bluffs.  How did you come across that place?  How did you get a hold of it?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:03:58):**  So how did you come to manage it?  Sure.  I originally graduated from western Kansas from Quinter, a school out in western Kansas,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:04:12):**  and went to college at Fort Hayes and obtained a degree in animal science.  After that I wanted to go back to the farm but there really wasn't any room.  The farms just weren't big enough.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:04:22):**  Dad's farm wasn't.  And so instead I went into ag finance and started originally with farm credit and then  eventually into the commercial banking sector, working mostly with farmers, seeing lots of  
**[0:04:35-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:04:35):**  different operations, lived in a couple of three different states as we moved around.  Ended up back in Plainville, or in Plainville, managing a branch bank and doing the ag lending  for them.  
**[0:04:50-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:04:50):**  And that was kind of when I first got the chance to start renting a little farm ground.  And I had rented some other ground around before I got this place but just picked up  a little bit here and there and was continuing to do the banking thing as well.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:04):**  And then got the chance to rent this.  That was about 2007 I guess.  The owner was a, well he wasn't really absentee.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:13):**  He lived out here part of the year but he was kind of a challenging fellow.  He'd been through six tenants in seven years.  And so I was told when I rented it that I would not enjoy it very much because he was  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:26):**  difficult to get along with but he and I were fine.  It worked out pretty good.  I was close to here and I could be here quickly if he needed something or if the cows were  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:34):**  out or something like that.  And so I picked it up and I was still a farmer, still banking as well and actually had a full-time  hired man at the time.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:43):**  And then in 2009 we planted most everything to corn.  We'd taken out a bunch of CRP and at the time I was like I said a pretty conventional farmer.  We did no-kill but it was all corn and wheat and milo and raised some cattle.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:05:58):**  So we were doing everything real conventionally.  Planted everything to corn.  It was a wonderful corn year.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:05):**  Had some record yields on dry land.  Some of these dry land river bottoms made 250 bushels to the acre which was just incredible.  And I thought well this is easy.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:15):**  I'm going to quit this banking job and go farm full-time.  My hired man was moving on and I thought this is a great opportunity.  And it didn't rain for three years I don't think.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:25):**  That's what I tell people anyway.  We went into a little drought right away in 11 and then the big drought hit us in 2012  and I was up here without an income, without really anything growing very well.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:39):**  It was a challenging time.  And so we started looking into some different options.  That's kind of what led us down into the rabbit hole that became regenerative agriculture  
**[0:06:48-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:48):**  for us.  Started looking into how we could do this a little differently and make some changes.  And right as we were doing all that stuff my landlord came to me and this was in early  
**[0:06:59-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:06:59):**  2015 I guess and said that I talked to him about making a switch to no crops and no chemicals  and he was all on board.  But then he came to me in January and said that he had been diagnosed with cancer.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:07:12):**  And at the time he'd never been married, never had any kids and so he decided to leave the  ranch to me which was an amazing humbling experience to be honest with you.  He decided to change my family tree as part of that.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:07:28):**  And so we kind of, I kind of parked most of the equipment for 15 and we took care of him.  He wanted a few things done around the ranch, cleaned up and things and so we did all that.  It got complicated by the end.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:07:45):**  My wife had quit her job.  She was a nurse and she was taking care of him full time.  A girlfriend who had left back when he announced I was going to get the ranch came back in  
**[0:07:55-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:07:55):**  November and they got married in a secret ceremony out at the ranch in December and  then she took him to a new attorney in January and had him change all of his papers and he  was, he died a week later.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:08:09):**  So we were left with this huge mess, this crazy estate battle that we had to get into.  We filed suit and went through a whole bunch of hoops and ultimately I approached the new  wife, the new widow and kind of made her an offer just to let her disappear because she  
**[0:08:26-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:08:26):**  was mostly after money anyway and she did.  She took me up on it which saved us a ton of legal fees and a whole bunch of time.  So that's how we got to be here.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:08:36):**  It was an amazing experience.  I tell people it was like winning the lottery but the lottery ticket cost a half million  bucks for sure and by the time we were done with it, you know inheriting a ranch sounds  
**[0:08:49-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:08:49):**  like a great plan but if by the time you roll all the existing debt together plus the settlement  debt together if your payments about triple it's not always the best blessing in the world  and so it's been an uphill battle for sure from that and part of what we liked about  
**[0:09:04-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:04):**  the whole regenerative ag approach was the lower cost, the lower inputs because it just  didn't make sense to go out and try to plant a corn crop or spend a bunch of money on inputs.  So that's how we ended up here anyway, yeah.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:18):**  Alright so how many acres again have you taken out of basically commodity crop production  and put back into grass?  Sure.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:26):**  We haven't really put anything back into grass.  We the 2500 acres on the ranch consists of about 650 acres of really good mostly bottom  ground, farm ground.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:39):**  Sorry about that.  Let me turn that off real quick.  May have a little bit of, what was that a driveway alarm?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:49):**  That was a driveway alarm, yes.  My apologies I meant to turn that off an hour ago so.  It happens.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:09:56):**  Anyway there's yeah right there's about 650 acres of really good mostly bottom ground,  farm ground on it and we've started letting some of that go back into grass but we're  still farming most of it, well relatively farming most of it.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:12):**  What we do now is on most of those acres we plant a cast crop or a cover crop and we graze  it.  So we've done away with the cash crops completely on everything.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:21):**  We don't have a combine anymore.  We don't do any of that stuff.  We plant a two year rotation of three different cash cover crops that we can graze.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:30):**  The goal is to take everything off of the cows.  Okay cool.  So what can we get into maybe some of the economics of that and what your some of the  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:42):**  economics of that?  I mean we don't have to get in real deep and we don't have to do it right now.  We can always circle back later.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:48):**  Yeah absolutely no.  So happy to.  About 1900 acres of grass then?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:10:54):**  Yes, yes right about that.  There's some waste ground with the river and all that other fun stuff but sure.  So what are you doing with the rest of the ranch?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:11:04):**  Like are you doing high frequency daily moves?  Yeah absolutely.  We did because this is a relatively unique place and like where I live if the river's  
**[0:11:14-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:11:14):**  up it takes 10 miles of driving to get to the other two-thirds of the ranch and you  have to go different directions to get to each third.  So it's it can be kind of kind of a challenging setup and we've got lots of different soil  
**[0:11:28-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:11:28):**  types and so what we did after we looked through a lot of the holistic management practices  and went through all the classes we broke the ranch up into five different management  zones that range anywhere from very thin upland topsoil that might have three inches of soil  
**[0:11:43-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:11:43):**  and then it's limestone rock and that grows different grass than our good subirrigated  native bottomlands and so we manage them different in the same way with our our farm ground where  those are a different management zone too.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:11:56):**  Which lets us like when we're grazing a cover crop for instance we might be on that real  quick and be on 30-day rotations or rest periods and get right back to it and try to pound  it in but when we hit the native grass we might end up with an 18-month rest period.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:12:11):**  It just depends on how the grazing plan flexes around.  Every year has been different and I think with different management zones like that  every year is going to be different.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:12:22):**  And every year is different with rainfall too and that makes a huge difference and it's  timing of rainfall or you could have the same exact rain that you had last year on the same  days but it could be four degrees cooler on average and your grass production is way different.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:12:40):**  An early or late spring affects everything or an early freeze will totally change how  you manage things.  We had one of the challenging things that we did after we went through the whole inheritance  
**[0:12:52-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:12:52):**  we didn't have a lot of cows and so we did the custom cows for a little while.  Custom cows when it's year-round stuff is a little different animal than like taking  in cows for grazing stairs and things like that.

Right, yeah when we had a hard time finding guys that had cows that were really suited  to the low input model that we were trying to embrace and so we ultimately ended up buying  
**[0:13:19-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:13:19):**  our own cows which was a pretty big investment and then the year we did that was the spring  of 2018 and we got a huge flood come through here right at the end of May in 2018.  Lost a few calves, got most of them to high ground in time but had well had areas that  
**[0:13:41-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:13:41):**  are never underwater under six feet of water and that was the second of actually five floods  we had over about two and a half years that just really changed for two years I couldn't  get into my big fields, my beautiful big bottom grand fields you normally would raise such  
**[0:13:55-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:13:55):**  great crops they were wet you couldn't go down there and farm them.  I actually have video of building fence to Johnson grass that had grown up wild in there  to graze it we were driving through it and there'd be six inches or a foot of water.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:14:10):**  So those fields kind of sat idle for a couple years and that really changed the whole approach  and like you say the rain fight every year is going to be so different that's why I like  the holistic approach because you get to plan and re-plan constantly.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:14:23):**  Right.  You can adjust.  How many did you say how many years in total you're doing this?  
**[0:14:28-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:14:28):**  I've been farming full-time I guess since 2010.  I was farming part of the time I started my farm in 2006 so we're probably about five  so yeah.  
**[0:14:44-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:14:44):**  What has been the biggest change you've seen?  It's all been a change.  If you could prioritize like the most meaningful one that's what I want to know.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:15:03):**  Without a doubt the discovery of holistic management regenerative grazing polybraid  whatever I mean whatever tool you want to pick out of that toolbox that has changed  how we approach farming for sure.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:15:16):**  Back when I started this deal I thought the ideal farm would be you know at one time and  I built it up to about 4,500 acres and I had 2,000 acres of grass and 2,500 acres of farm  ground and I thought that would be a lot of fun to have the equipment and the combines  
**[0:15:30-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:15:30):**  and everything else.  Oh and I discovered that was a great way to lose any money that you had.  If you aren't really well capitalized I'm not starting I'm not joining an existing farm  
**[0:15:42-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:15:42):**  I have to go out and buy my own stuff.  Coming from the banking background by about 2012 I was looking myself in the mirror going  we have to figure out why this won't work because farming is not working and I saw that  
**[0:15:55-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:15:55):**  writing on the wall I worked with a lot of ag producers back in my days at the bank and  I got very good at analyzing balance sheets and tax returns and I have to say that most  people don't make money in agriculture most years and that was that's a sobering reality  
**[0:16:10-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:16:10):**  for most of us and the discovery of something like regenerative agriculture and what it  could possibly do for agriculture in general that's that's been exciting that's easily  the biggest thing otherwise I'd probably go do something different.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:16:27):**  What have been some of your biggest influences and education resources for regenerative ag?  Sure I started going down that particular rabbit hole very slowly way back in in the  2000s my dad got on the mailing list and then I did too for a guy named Kit Ferro out in  
**[0:16:49-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:16:49):**  eastern Colorado and you both heard of him and he started challenging my paradigms about  how we raise cattle for sure and I had at the time I didn't have a lot of cows and I  didn't make a lot of changes like he was talking to you but by the time we bought a bowl or  
**[0:17:04-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:17:04):**  two and I'd had Kit come out and give some speeches to some of my farmers he was at least  convincing me that we could do some things differently and so once I bought a bowl from  him then you get involved in this email discussion group that he has and that had Gabe Brown  
**[0:17:19-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:17:19):**  on it had Gabe Brown and and even some it's kind of like a cult it will and say what you  will about Kit that's true absolutely I don't disagree one bit but boy there's an awful  lot of information on that that discussion group between Gabe being on there and then  
**[0:17:37-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:17:37):**  the ranching for profit guys were on there and always sharing things it's it's pretty  it was it was an eye-opening experience anyway from yeah so and then after that you know  I heard Gabe speak a few different times it was kind of slowly soaking in but not enough  
**[0:17:58-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:17:58):**  to make me make wholesale changes on my operation saw the TED talk by savory and thought yeah  this is probably right and then got up against the wall and realized that if I didn't make  some changes I was gonna go broke I was by the time the opportunity to inherit the ranch  
**[0:18:14-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:18:14):**  came around I was a broke but not ready to not yet ready willing to admit it farmer right  I mean I I didn't want to admit it to myself but there was no way we were going to get  over some of the debt problems that we had and so I convinced myself that we're gonna  
**[0:18:29-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:18:29):**  have to make these wholesale changes and that's what I threw myself into studying it and trying  to learn about it seeing if it was gonna really work awesome so I I kind of want to maybe  delve into a little bit of the place you're on the the guy you inherited from the problems  
**[0:18:48-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:18:48):**  of this previous tenant and what did you do differently to make that relationship work  yeah um lots of lots of farmers who have just been farmers or ranchers and this is no kind  of a dig on anyone tend not to necessarily be excellent at customer service because that's  
**[0:19:13-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:19:13):**  not their wheelhouse they haven't had to do a lot of customer service in their life and  I did I came from the banking industry where that was what it was you sold relationships  and we were good at it and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he could call  
**[0:19:28-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:19:28):**  me and I would be there quickly and I helped him out if he wanted something sprayed or  something done I would help him out on that but I think at the end of the day it was just  about being able to relate to him and make him feel like what he thought mattered he  
**[0:19:43-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:19:43):**  was the landowner and and I think a lot of a lot of guys came down here and didn't like  his particular approach and that's because he wanted to know some stuff and once you  got over that it was not that big of a deal and you had to be used to you had to be willing  
**[0:19:58-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:19:58):**  to blow off if he was upset I should just let him be upset you know that happens sometimes  and a lot of people don't like doing that and so but yeah I think that was probably  the biggest difference yeah yeah  
**[0:20:12-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:20:12):**  So your current enterprises are are mostly grazing custom grazing and you have some of  your own cows correct?  Well we have all of our own cows now yeah we don't do the custom grazing anymore we  
**[0:20:24-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:20:24):**  decided to buy our own cows.  So let's talk about your cows what kind of cows you got and why?  Mostly well they're they're mostly black but we're not married to black cows by any means  
**[0:20:37-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:20:37):**  we bought a fair number of cattle from from down south that are partially low line so  they're gonna be a little bit smaller a lot of a lot of thousand eleven hundred pound  cows out in the herd we're shooting for lower maintenance lower maintenance costs we're  
**[0:20:57-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:20:57):**  not like I said I'm not married to any particular breed I for me the breed arguments kind of  sound like the arguments between Dodge and Chevy and Ford pickups after a while there's  good ones there's bad ones I'm perfectly fine with all that but at the same time at the  
**[0:21:13-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:21:13):**  end of the day they're kind of the tool for harvesting what we were allowed to grow from  the solar energy that we're trying to harvest so exactly the goal ultimately is to not just  have the cows we'd love to diversify into other protein sources eventually that will  
**[0:21:27-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:21:27):**  be what we do.  Okay I have a quite a few friends who ask CK where do I go get grass-fed cows like what  are the genetics right and I get that question all the time like man maybe I should be become  
**[0:21:40-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:21:40):**  a grass-fed genetics breeder because only I only can only refer kick Pharaoh, Mushrush  ranches and some other people too so it seems like there's a big need for it.  The list yeah is fairly short and you know think about what it was like 10 years ago  
**[0:21:55-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:21:55):**  when we were trying to kick this around there was no place to go that's why Kent Pharaoh  sold a lot of bulls and why I think he still sells a lot of bulls because you can you can  kind of guarantee that those genetics are at least going to be designed to be low maintenance  
**[0:22:09-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:22:09):**  good grass genetics.  I see more and more guys that are doing the right things anymore I don't know I'm I'm  not a big bull sale fan I don't follow the bull market or the breeder market or anything  
**[0:22:20-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:22:20):**  like that but it seems like there's if there's a nest share there's surely going to be people  stepping up to fill it I'd sure like to think so and I I sure think that there's a huge  opportunity there for people to do that.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:22:31):**  So other diversification options besides livestock some of the things that we've talked about  in previous episodes like with Dallas Mount is you can concessionize things on the ranch  so you want to go down that rabbit trail of of how you've concessionized your ranch?  
**[0:22:50-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:22:50):**  Yeah well we um and and again you know we're very lucky in that we've got a beautiful amazing  property here and and it didn't feel right just sitting on it after the floods came through  we washed out of well I'll back up for a minute the previous owner had built right up against  
**[0:23:07-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:23:07):**  the base of the floods a swimming pool area that had a had a sun shade and a little pool  house and and just a neat area for his friends to come down and party he was actually a I  guess you'd call him an unreformed hippie and he was kind of trying to recreate Woodstock  
**[0:23:22-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:23:22):**  right so the Woodstock idea seemed like a great plan to him and really he built a beautiful  area down there they trenched in water and trenched in power and had a little RV hookup  for his friends to come down and camp and party and and it was a lot of fun looked like  
**[0:23:36-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:23:36):**  a fun it was a fun area and then after after we came out here that's actually we got married  my wife and I got married up on the cliffs and then had our reception down by the pool  and it was a really neat area for the family unfortunately the floods that came through  
**[0:23:50-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:23:50):**  in 2018 took the entire pool the sun shade it took it all it was all gone so we were  left with what essentially is now a cow pasture that's got some pretty cool views kind of  kicked it around a few different directions what we wanted to do with it and nothing seemed  
**[0:24:08-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:24:08):**  right a little over a year ago I found a well it was actually a Facebook ad for an outfit  called hip camp an app called hip camp and what they're designed to do is bring landowners  and campers people who want to go out and camp in nature together kind of like Airbnb  
**[0:24:26-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:24:26):**  only just getting started so we signed up and I thought well I could pick out four or  five campgrounds and I did that and we took some pictures and didn't think much of it  that was in February and COVID hit you know right after that and those of us that we were  
**[0:24:41-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:24:41):**  all affected by COVID we've all got the story to tell whether it was we have 60 heifers  that were going to be direct marketed to people and right about the time COVID made all the  butcher dates disappear we had to make decisions on what to do right but right as all that  
**[0:24:56-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:24:56):**  was going on and everything was such a mess we started getting campers a lot of campers  amazingly that was a very popular thing because COVID all the national parks were booked up  everybody was traveling differently nobody was flying over America or over the heartland  
**[0:25:13-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:25:13):**  like they used to everybody was if they were going to travel they were going to camp trying  to stay away from the hotels all that other fun stuff so it was a perfect time to start  a campground we we started with just two well actually just one powered site and four primitive  
**[0:25:28-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:25:28):**  sites and then we built up another powered site after that and had literally thousands  of people stop through here last summer I was amazed I I couldn't believe that that  many people were willing to come up here and we're only 20 miles off the interstate and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:25:44):**  so it was a relatively convenient drive but it was really something else you know they'd  come down here and it looks it looks really different than anything they've been seeing  and then we'd start telling the stories about you know well how did you get here and so  
**[0:25:57-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:25:57):**  tell them the same story I just told you and what are we doing and I so I talk about regenerative  agriculture and by the end of most of the campers visits they were terribly excited  about what we were doing it was a real breath of fresh air after two years of managing through  
**[0:26:12-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:26:12):**  flood crisis and then we went right into a little mini drought that last year and everything  it was really nice to talk to people totally outside of agriculture who thought this makes  perfect sense you know we described the whole story of regenerative agriculture so by the  
**[0:26:27-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:26:27):**  end of it we decided that we were really onto something and we decided it made sense to  try to expand the campground this year and so that's our plan we're actually going to  become a commercial campground with a wedding venue an event venue plenty of sites and everything  
**[0:26:42-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:26:42):**  else it's for us the hospitality industry is going to be as much as the livestock industry  and and again part of that's because we're blessed with this great view at the same time  I personally think every single regenerative farmer out there ag guy we should all have  
**[0:27:00-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:27:00):**  two or three primitive sites you should be taking in campers and talking to people you  get to share your story it's amazing you love it and you know people are like well can I  buy some hamburger from you oh sure maybe we can do that and then by the end of last  
**[0:27:17-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:27:17):**  season we were offering baskets that they can buy food baskets that include ranch raised  hamburger home-cooked potatoes but you know we what it works out to at the end of this  we're selling our cold cow hamburger for ten dollars a pound through our baskets and if  
**[0:27:32-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:27:32):**  you can take a cow that's worth a thousand bucks and turn into something worth five thousand  bucks you've all of a sudden done what we're talking about a ranching for profit right  um that's they all work together it was a really cool thing that was I've been in agriculture  
**[0:27:47-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:27:47):**  one form of it or another since I was a kid I've not out other than a few commercial loans  and I did some loans in the hospitality industry and liked it then but I've never stepped into  an industry like that and tried to figure it out and it was a wonderful experience because  
**[0:28:04-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:28:04):**  different from agriculture the inputs aren't near as high and the profit margins are really  good and people are excited if you're if you're doing a campground you're catching people  on their vacations and so they're they're used to spending money they're having a good  
**[0:28:18-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:28:18):**  time usually they're in a pretty positive mood and they're not carrying around a lot  of work stress exactly exactly right it was it was an especially last year you know to  come to a place like this and be away from everything in the middle of COVID was a huge

**[0:28:48-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:28:48):**  they're booking for a week because they want to stay down here work for a week and then  they'll move on to the next place that's what they're looking for it's those kinds of experiences  you know I when you got into hip camp last year it was just a little bit after COVID  
**[0:29:02-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:29:02):**  I saw you started to get into it and you had a first couple bookings and I was like hey  I can do that too so I got a primitive site set up and I'll admit mine's nowhere near  as popular as yours is because I'm way farther off the beaten track but I'm having a similar  
**[0:29:19-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:29:19):**  experience with all my campers they'll all love it and the ones that do that do want  me to come out and chat I I kind of have an unattended check-in because it's you know  out there in the pasture and sure you know so I always say you know I'd be happy to help  
**[0:29:35-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:29:35):**  be happy to stop by and and visit and most time they don't want to chat but when they  do it's you know I kind of have to be like I got to go to a bull sale you know just to  get away from but it is a fantastic experience didn't you get some sort of award for your  
**[0:29:57-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:29:57):**  hip camp operation yeah we we got a couple of awards yeah for our first year and we were  pretty happy about this we were voted the number one hip camp in Kansas and then the  number two hip camp RV hip camp in the country which we only had two sites at the time the  
**[0:30:18-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:30:18):**  expanded way to get to 12 or maybe even a few more but to get to get the number two  RV hip camp in the country with two sites we were real excited about like I say for  us especially this property the hospitality business makes perfect sense we between weddings  
**[0:30:35-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:30:35):**  and things like that in the future we will hopefully well I'm sure the hospitality business  will be bigger than the cattle business eventually so so what are some of the things holding  you back from stepping on the gas on on this hospitality enterprise sure well there's a  
**[0:30:55-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:30:55):**  ranch deal to manage that's worth saying this is about a full-time job anyway and like you  said the campers want to talk the campers want to interact we actually sell ranch tours  for $100 you get a couple hours with me and the Ranger and I take you around and show  
**[0:31:09-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:31:09):**  you all the sites and we go to the top and everything and so for me what I found last  year was from about three o'clock on I needed to be dedicating myself to the campground  which makes it harder as you're trying to do ranch work clean up after floods and everything  
**[0:31:25-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:31:25):**  else that's really the biggest challenge like ranch work always has a schedule right right  right and you know to be honest after we get mobbed up we don't mob as much in the spring  as much in the winter but as we get mobbed up here in the spring the truth is so I can  
**[0:31:43-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:31:43):**  still get the mob moved in a couple of hours and still be able to get a lot of the other  stuff done but there's just always lots of work that's that's how it's always going to  be you know on any farm there's never you're never going to get it all done is what I finally  
**[0:31:54-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:31:54):**  decided and so for us to really be able to focus on the hospitality stuff what we're  kind of what I'm going to start angling towards I guess is finding people who want to help  with with maybe the ranch side or do some of the other stuff for us it makes sense to  
**[0:32:12-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:32:12):**  maybe for me to concentrate on the hip camp stuff the campground and if I could find the  right person that maybe wants to start their own enterprise out here with sheep or goats  or pigs or chickens or whatever you know I'm at a point now if they'll come help me move  
**[0:32:29-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:32:29):**  my cows I'd give them the land to use at least to get their business started my apologies  to get their business started I that makes sense to me to try to bring in other people  who are excited about regenerative agriculture to find what we're doing real slowly and I  
**[0:32:48-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:32:48):**  guess you know put it out there on a podcast that's speeding it up a little bit but I've  been out looking for people somebody who would who would be interested in something like  that so that they could do all the cool stuff that we talk about on the regen ag side that  
**[0:33:02-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:33:02):**  I just don't always feel like I have the chance to do we should be we should either be a sign  of the savory hub or something like that and I I don't necessarily feel like I've got the  energy to put into that my it does take a lot of energy to our interests lie elsewhere  
**[0:33:14-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:33:14):**  and and while I would love to eventually host some big gatherings and some you know how  are we going to feed the world in the future types of gatherings the the best thing for  us to do is to look at how we can help other people to get started in this and maybe come  
**[0:33:30-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:33:30):**  in and take advantage of some of our resources that we can't right now so before we get too  far away from it you know I'm really in a very similar place that you are Chad if somebody  came up to me and was like hey I'll come help you move your cows I'll run your polywire  
**[0:33:47-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:33:47):**  you just let me run goats and I'd be like oh you're going to take care of that brush  problem for me and take care of and move my cows and I don't have to pay you deal so my  email my contact information is well known you contact me Chad put your email out right  
**[0:34:05-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:34:05):**  now so people can people know how to get a hold of you if they want to take you up on  that offer or send your proposal sure you bet my email is CA Tuttle and then the number  one at Gmail and then we've also got a pretty good website up and running now for C2TRanch.com  
**[0:34:25-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:34:25):**  you could go there and get hold of us as well and that has a lot of other stuff about our  story yeah pictures and all the other fun stuff you said our story so there's another  part right well yes I'm married my wife Cynthia we got married in 2017 but have been together  
**[0:34:43-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:34:43):**  since 2012 I guess I figured any woman who could put up with me through the drought of  2012 was probably worth keeping around that that's reasonable that's reasonable I only  lived through that drought too I know I understand every one of us that lived through it's got  
**[0:35:00-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:35:00):**  the stories to tell for sure and then we've got between the two of us we've got four children  and then we've also adopted two a niece and a nephew that were raised in a four and an  eight-year-old so yeah there's kids running around here and all kinds of crazy stuff  
**[0:35:20-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:35:20):**  so I just saw this article about Scotland and Italy or spending billions of dollars  to improve their infrastructure so that people can come and work there remotely so they're  gonna have like hubs for people to visit it's I mean basically what you're doing Chad like  
**[0:35:38-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:35:38):**  it's an amazing concept people are gonna go destination work from from home right remotely  exactly right why why wouldn't you if if you weren't tied to a physical place right we  just proved a whole bunch of people aren't if I wasn't tied to this ranch I would be  
**[0:35:57-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:35:57):**  somewhere else I would either I mean I'd be in Egypt or I'd be I mean I'd love to be in  lots of other places so yeah it makes sense we think that if you can offer up a nice secluded  resort style feel but still a campground people will come to it we're sure of it we we saw  
**[0:36:17-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:36:17):**  that last year yeah I've been able to work from home for the past four years now so I've  been able to live in the Caribbean, California, Texas, Idaho, and Kansas and people are like  what is that like what is that life like I'm like it's actually really great because when  
**[0:36:34-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:36:34):**  I go on vacation I just have to let them know I'm gonna stay in Idaho for an extra week  or stay here and they're like as long as you have good internet that's all that matters  right so yeah it's a paradigm change for a whole lot of people right it's gonna be a  
**[0:36:49-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:36:49):**  major way we do things in the future so let's see how we can fit into that as an industry  appeal to the people who are looking for and in my experience people want to know where  the fruit's coming from the vast majority of I met more people from New York City, Washington  
**[0:37:05-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:37:05):**  DC, and LA last year in the summer than I had my entire life before that and without  exception they were all very interested and COVID made it very obvious to them that there  were some holes in the in the food chain right and so they're very interested in this deal  
**[0:37:21-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:37:21):**  what what could we do different and talk about some great campfire conversations with people  outside of agriculture learning about an opportunity here to really make a difference it was it  was an eye-opening experience and I think it's I think going around and talking to farmers  
**[0:37:37-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:37:37):**  is a great idea I think that the guys that go around like well I've heard Gabe Brown  speak several times and lots of other guys but you know most most of us sat in that audience  and you change you change lives pretty slowly at that rate because most farmers aren't gonna  
**[0:37:55-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:37:55):**  be changing their paradigms real quickly we do that pretty slowly in agriculture but boy  if you can expose some people from LA to the honest truth about how we could be raising  our food and how we are raising our food their eyes pop open that's a big difference for  
**[0:38:11-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:38:11):**  them they start making different changes in how they buy things right away they start  making better choices with their food dollars and they start asking questions and I think  these a lot of these big mega multinational mega food corporations do not want a lot of  
**[0:38:29-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:38:29):**  these questions being asked.  Sure shining shining the light on some of this stuff is probably the silver lining of  COVID right we can we can now stand up and say hey what we were predicting was wrong  
**[0:38:43-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:38:43):**  with your food supply system really is and here's a better way to do this if you if you  know your farmer or if we develop the regional food supply systems like Mike Calacrate talks  about or however we go about this entire system the food hubs is a great idea our system of  
**[0:38:59-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:38:59):**  trying to be direct market our goal eventually is to be direct market as much as we can through  campground stuff and then the rest of it we hope to be producing at a low enough cost  that we could go wholesale or wherever it's got to go I know that's not the best choice  
**[0:39:15-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:39:15):**  but until you've got a whole lot of population you can sell a product to you kind of have  to take what you can and I think that'll still work out here it's just it would be nice to  have that wholesale option be something other than the big corporation that you know is  
**[0:39:29-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:39:29):**  screwing you over because that's what they've been doing hopefully someday we'll get that  system built I think it's possible  you know I I was just sitting here thinking about the genius of offering your guests a  
**[0:39:44-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:39:44):**  beef basket and you know they're getting a good deal you're getting a good price and  they're taking the ranch with them for several days and they're going to talk about it for  several days as they consume that meat and maybe they're running around maybe they're  
**[0:40:01-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:40:01):**  hitting other campgrounds and they're sharing that meat with people that they meet and and  share a meal with over a fire so you know those kind of things we can't underestimate  the value in positive public relations of some of those things and just planting those  
**[0:40:22-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:40:22):**  seeds and sparks of getting people to start asking questions about where their food comes  from and what's in it exactly and that's all you really do is plant the seeds and see where  they go and and again the thing that we love about this is about the campground idea is  
**[0:40:38-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:40:38):**  that you get to constantly do that new you get this constant influx of different people  all the time and yeah eventually you'll you get to where you get some repeats and everything  else but constantly having a new bunch of people interested in this is is truly unique  
**[0:40:55-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:40:55):**  that's not easy to come by in an industry like that it's pretty hard to go out anywhere  locally you know if you're trying to go to a farmer's market you don't necessarily find  a new clientele every week because the same people go there but boy campers they change  
**[0:41:08-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:41:08):**  and they're always moving and so you get to see somebody new all the time tell that story  so what what are some of the what are some of the best reactions you've had from campers  about either your land or regenerative agriculture or or about your beef  
**[0:41:23-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:41:23):**  again we're very fortunate we I think we had 170 written reviews left last year and they  were 100 positive oh wow and yeah so and that doesn't happen very often on the internet  everybody knows how snorky internet reviews can get we were we were very pleased to see  
**[0:41:44-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:41:44):**  to see us 100 positive and and that'll go away someday we'll get it we'll get one in  that we don't make happy but you know the obvious the land beauty is something that  we are just blessed to have where we had no control over that for me the the most valuable  
**[0:42:00-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:42:00):**  feedback I think has been just through the whole conversation of regenerative agriculture  we had we had a couple of motorcyclists make reservations last September and they wanted  to hammer camp and so we found picked out the right spot and they turned out to be documentary  
**[0:42:17-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:42:17):**  filmmakers making their way across America for Sony and NBC and they were at the time  they were headed out west to to shoot stuff on the wildfires but they were shooting a  series called Accra or in America I guess is how they titled it and they ended up staying  
**[0:42:32-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:42:32):**  an extra day and we took them all around the ranch and they shot footage and had similar  conversations to like what we're having now about how we how we should be approaching  feeding the world what you know how this should look that was easily my most positive feedback  
**[0:42:48-0:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:42:48):**  was those two we we continue to correspond with them and I don't think anything's made  the air yet but from the footage they shot but I know they're working on all that stuff  editing apparently takes forever on things like that but regardless those guys they're  
**[0:43:04-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:43:04):**  from New York City and you know traveling all around and looking for good human interest  stories but they were blown away by the idea that we could fix all this by how we farm  we could fix all this by raising better food by by doing away with with the pre-processed  
**[0:43:20-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:43:20):**  junk that's not helping anybody they left here thinking there might actually be a little  bit of a solution which is fun there's an awful lot of cynicism out there if if you  live in New York City and you just watch the news I don't know are you very optimistic  
**[0:43:37-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:43:37):**  about the future I most of them don't seem to be until they get out here and kind of  do something different yeah yeah I think if you watch too much CNN and NBC and CBS you  just can't help but be depressed about the state of the world even Fox like like you  
**[0:43:53-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:43:53):**  know the heat of the elections and COVID and just everything else thrown into it right  last year I was pretty depressed because I was I was staying inside not going out not  going like out shopping or whatever or outdoors going you know to restaurants and then I think  
**[0:44:10-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:44:10):**  it was my girlfriend was like you need to get out like you are just you're absorbing  a lot of negative energy when that's not how your real world is so and it's right you're  I mean even my wife if she's not if she doesn't get into the Ranger every couple of days and  
**[0:44:26-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:44:26):**  ride around and help me check cows and help I mean you absorb that like you said negative  stuff that you're hearing all the time I mean weighs on people I I'm convinced regardless  of even even if you don't watch the political stuff even if you've decided to completely  
**[0:44:42-0:44:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:44:42):**  leave all that stuff behind the general news is going to be negative those people here  that's just how it is and like I said a lot of people left here thinking what maybe there's  a little something different and about that time kiss the ground came out on Netflix so

**[0:45:10-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:45:10):**  how about this and it's fun because once they go down that little particular rabbit hole  they find that they can change a whole lot of things in their life which is cool start  changing lives for the better all the way across  
**[0:45:25-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:45:25):**  right on right on  I'm gonna see Kay you got anything  I'm gonna have to go to go to the folder  
**[0:45:43-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:45:43):**  so your wife's no longer nursing right no she's a full-time housewife yeah yeah that's  me good  I'll make a note we'll fix this little part yeah I'd like one of the questions if you  
**[0:46:07-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:46:07):**  didn't bring anyone back from the dead who would it be  bring anyone back from the dead  maybe you're you're past the past landowner  
**[0:46:21-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:46:21):**  mark was an interesting individual I'm trying to think I listened to I've listened to most  or all of your other podcasts I think how did Brian ask that question differently he  said who would you have if you could bring him back to have supper with yeah yeah okay  
**[0:46:41-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:46:41):**  to visit and actually I wouldn't bring anybody back I'd love to sit down with Elon Musk yeah  I think he'd be fascinating to talk to and honestly I think he needs to hear what regenerative  agriculture could do I think he would be somewhat interested yeah do you think you'll listen  
**[0:46:57-0:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:46:57):**  though you know Elon's all about solutions and it's a solution it's a truth solution  so and I get that you know I I've been trying to chirp at him on Twitter for for months  now I've been chirping at Bill Gates too I'm reading that book and yeah I don't even want  
**[0:47:15-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:47:15):**  to get started on it on Bill Gates's book and wow but yeah yeah Elon Elon my biggest  problem with Elon is like I love what he's doing with SpaceX I'm a big SpaceX fan like  I'm just waiting for him like as as we're recording this sn15 is on the pad I think  
**[0:47:37-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:47:37):**  they're gonna go for a test maybe today or tomorrow the big booster they're getting ready  to test the big booster like maybe next week yeah it's pretty cool what he's doing but  I've also kind of looked into logistics of just how many starships that guy's gonna have  
**[0:47:55-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:47:55):**  to build to get his Mars goal in 30 years like he's gonna have thousands upon thousands  upon thousands of those things to move all the tonnage to Mars and then for those of  us not following Elon Musk's what is this what he wants to colonize Mars okay like and  
**[0:48:17-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:48:17):**  he wants to do it in like 30 years he wants to put I don't know this is absurd amount  of people on Mars in 30 years I mean it's a very it's a very audacious plan I just want  to know how he's gonna feed everybody with food grown on Mars without taking ruminants  
**[0:48:38-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:48:38):**  and poultry with him agreed and I think that there's some challenges there that that you'll  have to deal with for sure and on the Mars mission especially that'll probably look a  little different than we normally think of as regenerative agriculture although it's  
**[0:48:55-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:48:55):**  probably going to look something like it only done without the ruminants done with biology  brought in undoubtedly which is kind of what you have to do when you're talking about colonizing  a different planet but I mean can you replicate the complex interactions of biology and the  
**[0:49:13-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:49:13):**  cow and the forage in a vat not completely I'm sure I would agree I mean I think I think  that there's all kinds of challenges technological hurdles to overcome on that entire project  and that's not even really for me what I what I enjoy about Elon Musk is he's taken at least  
**[0:49:40-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:49:40):**  three different industries the finance industry he sat on its head through PayPal he's just  oh and honestly they forced him out a CEO at PayPal before he could really make the  changes but he was going to do some other stuff there that he's still got in the back  
**[0:49:55-0:50:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:49:55):**  more but he loves the idea of upsetting all these industries and then he did the same  thing with the automobile industry with Tesla these are the revamping how they look at things  and and then he's doing the same thing obviously with space SpaceX and I think those are the  
**[0:50:09-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:50:09):**  people who are early adopters into this regenerative ag movement I think that we like the idea  of or at least I like the idea of paradigm breaking because most of the industries most  of the just the institutions that we have as humans the paradigms are wrong most of  
**[0:50:27-0:50:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:50:27):**  us would like to change a lot of things about how education's done health I mean don't don't  go down the hole of health because that's going to tie right back into the AG stuff  and it right but what the further I went down the regenerative agriculture rabbit hole the  
**[0:50:40-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:50:40):**  more I realized everything was wrong with lots of different institutions out there Elon's  really good at tearing that stuff down and he would be if he would understand it and  would agree with it he would be an ideal spokesman just to lead the charge yeah because people  
**[0:50:57-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:50:57):**  will listen and and while I think I mean I would think people like Gabe Brown are super  excited right because this movement's picking up steam he's been out here talking about  this stuff for 20 years and we finally start to see some stuff picking up steam well we  
**[0:51:11-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:51:11):**  could move it really quick in our generation if we could find somebody who could stand  up and get the attention of all the people who are talking about reductionist solutions  and instead go here's the holistic solution and and Elon thinks holistically he doesn't  
**[0:51:25-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:51:25):**  necessarily talk about the holistic thought process but that's how he thinks if you read  his books and pay attention to what he's talking about he thinks holistically he'll understand  that yeah in my opinion I think the last thing I really listened to of his was the interview  
**[0:51:40-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:51:40):**  with Rogan where they were smoking on the air oh really and I'm not sure I finished  that one yeah but I know I do watch this I do watch a lot of his stuff that he talks  about SpaceX and you know his big Tesla announcements I try to pay attention to that stuff and sure  
**[0:51:58-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:51:58):**  keep up with where he is on energy energy density of batteries per cost unit and see  where he's at per cost unit of mass to orbit right because you know we're in business too  we can understand those terms but right and both I was gonna say and you and I've talked  
**[0:52:19-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:52:19):**  about that before how how that could very easily change on him pretty grand I mean the  supply chains could change a lot and it and it not be near as advantageous for him to  be doing the things he's doing and it'll be interesting to see how he deals with those  
**[0:52:33-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:52:33):**  problems again he's he's a holistic thought process manager it seems like anyway and we'll  see we'll see if he can find his way through those hurdles like they have this new format  battery coming out they've been talking about it for a couple months it's called the 4680  
**[0:52:49-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:52:49):**  it's a really short fat cell and they've come up with a new manufacturing process and it's  it's a big deal but they're having problems scaling it up but the reason they had to the  reason they're designing these batteries and they're they're keep trying to find more abundant  
**[0:53:11-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:53:11):**  materials to use for their batteries is because they realized there isn't enough of these  you know neodymium you know there isn't enough neodymium in the world to make all the batteries  that we need so we got to find something else like similarly you know like a thousand starships  
**[0:53:28-0:53:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:53:28):**  the guy's got to build thousands of starships and bfr's like that is just an absurd amount  of stainless steel and each one of those bfr's is going to have like 30 freaking rocket engines  on it like you know even though it's reusable we're talking about a lot of raw materials  
**[0:53:46-0:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:53:46):**  that have got to go into it and a lot of energy to manufacture it  and i guess for me and i completely agree with you and and i understand people are concerned  about the use of those materials for me i read articles about a 750 billion dollar pentagon  
**[0:54:06-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:54:06):**  budget or something like that next year and i think maybe maybe if we all put resources  into something like colonization instead of the other direction maybe maybe that's a better  use of them i i don't personally necessarily buy into the whole super limited resource  
**[0:54:25-0:54:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:54:25):**  idea there's enough asteroids there's an asteroid out there that if we mined it it could turn  every one of us into a trillionaire there's enough gold and silver on it we just have  to get to it so and that's and now we're back to technical stuff which is something that  
**[0:54:39-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:54:39):**  people like elon musk and and just generally we tend to be good at so let's figure it out  then there's enough stuff out there i i think the question needs to be do we want what kind  of society we do we want by 2050 do we want a technologically advanced interstellar thinking  
**[0:54:58-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:54:58):**  society or do that that also understands how to raise their food in such a way to not destroy  their home planet and and can do that or do we want bill gates's version which is different  he wants lots more of the technological stuff involved in agriculture right and i again  
**[0:55:17-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:55:17):**  i think that that's stuff that should be posed to elon because i think both stories end the  same way i mean both both stories start the same way but they end dramatically different  you know one way if we go down bill gates's route if we go down bill gates's path we'll  
**[0:55:33-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:55:33):**  be living on a chemically dead world within within a century and we will have to leave  we'll have to leave i want to ask a question do we really think bill gates understands  what he what's he what's being done in his name right now like is he aware of it or is  
**[0:55:53-0:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:55:53):**  he just that rich that he has people pulling all these strings and bill gates's name uh  well he came out and said the other day like you know he he owns like 242 000 acres of  farm ground right so that kind of got to be news and then he was interviewed and then  
**[0:56:11-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:56:11):**  he said well i didn't really that that really wasn't my decision my people did that because  we want to own the seeds and it has nothing to do with climate it has nothing to do with  the climate it has nothing to do with the environment we just bought those farms because  
**[0:56:29-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:56:29):**  we want a place to raise our version of patented seeds and it's like dude you just you seriously  became the world's single largest polluter by by being the world's largest farmland owner  in the united states he's the world's single largest polluter i guarantee it well he just  
**[0:56:48-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:56:48):**  buys offsets it doesn't matter he buys offsets that's what he said that's true and that's  how he's going to approach this is buying the offsets and uh i mean it's it's it's a  little premature to get into some of the economics but you know the price he's paying for offsets  
**[0:57:05-0:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:57:05):**  are 10 times what they're being sold for on the european market sure and it's almost like  you know i'm not very far through his book and it's almost like he's bragging about how  much money he's spending on these solutions because we have to do something we have to  
**[0:57:22-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:57:22):**  try we have to find these things even though they may may not pay off or it may be a loss  we have to invest in these technologies and it's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds  of millions of dollars but not a piece it's amazing that somebody can throw around money  
**[0:57:38-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:57:38):**  like that yeah like you know to us three the like that's not even a comprehensible amount  of money no right and and sure ck i would i mean i i would think that um no matter how  much and i saw the same article you did brian about how he doesn't how that was his team  
**[0:57:59-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:57:59):**  buying the farm ground and everything else at the end of the day he's an investor in  the fake meat um he's an investor into all of the chemical stuff um whether or not he's  really out to show us how we should be feeding the world which is kind of my take on it um  
**[0:58:15-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:58:15):**  or if he's just doing it for an investment i think either way we end up in the same pretty  negative spot with him calling the shots that's that's going to be a problem for doubt to  doubt yeah definitely i can't disagree with anything you just said chad at all and then  
**[0:58:30-0:58:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:58:30):**  to add a layer he wants to do the technology to dim the sun right so he's gonna have ultimate  control oh yeah let's dim the sun and then i'll have all the patented seeds that can  grow in the shade and you'll have to buy all your food for me and it'll all be impossible  
**[0:58:45-0:58:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:58:45):**  burgers if there was some evil person trying to take over the world this would be the script  for it it's right that's hard to believe and i'm not accusing him of that but this is how  you would write that script um you would say oh well now i'm going to control the sunlight  
**[0:58:59-0:59:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:58:59):**  that falls on the ground it's like the betterment right for the good yes it's like we almost  have about it so it's like we have a lex luther coming up in in bill gates but then we have  a billionaire rich guy of elon musk that's going to be batman and even though yeah i  
**[0:59:16-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:59:16):**  know lex luther batman never happened but that batman didn't have a comparable rich  guy villain because he was the rich guy oh superman wasn't rich i guess huh no no yeah  poor farm kid yeah poor farm kid from our part of the world actually right exactly but  
**[0:59:33-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:59:33):**  yes that's what i mean elon musk could play that role that's why i'd love to have dinner  with him um let's set up the two rich men in the world and well if the two richest men  in the world both believe that we're going to do this thing real really differently and  
**[0:59:48-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=0:59:48):**  get behind it both of them one of them is going to win and we think we know who that  would be i think there's an obvious choice that the public would like versus more processed  stuff more chemicals let's go the regenerative ag route it's just a matter of getting that  
**[1:00:03-1:00:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:00:03):**  message out there and that's that's why i like elon musk that's the only reason really  to be honest with you oh you know i'm i just i'm i'm like having dreams right now like  of joe rogan alan savory elon musk and bill gates like i was thinking oh man i'd that'd  
**[1:00:27-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:00:27):**  be pretty cool if we get elon and bill on this podcast and get them to debate but you  know i don't think i'm the right guy for that but i think that's joe rogan material yeah  you can do it right yeah i don't know that gates would do that just because he'd get  
**[1:00:41-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:00:41):**  open to so much stuff but because he doesn't do a lot of those kinds of things yeah he  probably wouldn't want to ask he doesn't want to be asked questions he doesn't already know  in advance i don't think i would agree and i would i would hazard the guess based off  
**[1:00:56-1:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:00:56):**  of my reading of his book and his interviews he has decided that that is um he knows the  answer to this question already he knows how we should be feeding people in 2050 and again  i we're all going to disagree with that the three of us will anyway unfortunately you  
**[1:01:13-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:01:13):**  know i think there's a lot of people that are going to end up going along with them  but you know that's i guess that's neither here nor there you know and that's there's  our challenge right that's kind of what what we found out um by talking to the people straight  
**[1:01:29-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:01:29):**  out of the cities straight out of la and washington dc and new york um they didn't necessarily  want the processed food they were as concerned about glyphosate in their food as as some  of the other people are um so yeah i mean it's more better of getting the message out  
**[1:01:45-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:01:45):**  i think i i still think that our message resonates much better with the average person far better  and when you start talking about you know adding in some transparency in there and as  i like to say shake the hand that feeds you you know get that direct connection between

**[1:02:18-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:02:18):**  that i mean obviously we could never say that the cows have never been anywhere else than  the ranch because they were all bought cows when we first started but at this point in  time as we're starting to bring cattle into the supply chain that's what we can say the  
**[1:02:30-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:02:30):**  cattle have all been on the ranch the whole time they were born they were you know they  were harvested here locally they never had anything given to them people love that people  people will buy extra from for something like that  
**[1:02:43-1:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:02:43):**  i actually i've changed my operation up a little bit this year and i'm thinking that  uh that i've got two bulls that are going to go to the grinder this year just because  i'll get a lot more money out of them than i will at the sale barn and all i think we  
**[1:03:02-1:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:03:02):**  can both agree all you have to do on social media right now is a livestock producer say  hey i've got 400 pounds of ground beef seven dollars a pound who wants it and it's gone  that was sure the case for quite a while i i don't know how it's moving through social  
**[1:03:20-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:03:20):**  media now but i mean it seems like everybody's moving the product they get um the challenging  part of course is is finding butcher dates and things like that around that's that's  been our biggest take-up actually is finding enough slaughter capacity to keep up we're  
**[1:03:33-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:03:33):**  not wanting to go super big right away um but just finding dates is hard right and so  you said you were caught up on podcasts so what did you think about mike calicrate back  in episode four and you kind of got into that a little bit earlier what are some thoughts  
**[1:03:48-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:03:48):**  you have on that i i like mike i've known mike for a lot of years i mean another western  kansas farm guy and i actually was at a bank in goodland and that's just south of where  he used to be at st francis and so i knew of him then and actually have a calicrate  
**[1:04:01-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:04:01):**  bander and things um mike and i approach things a lot differently lots of times and can get  sideways when it comes to what we think our politicians should be doing for us um and  that and i'm okay with that yeah that's that's i'm i'm there with mike too it's okay right  
**[1:04:19-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:04:19):**  exactly um but i i've always i've i was very interested in his mobile processing platform  that he'd been doing um if we could ever find somebody who wanted to come down here and  start their own enterprise i think some kind of mobile processing would make great sense  
**[1:04:38-1:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:04:38):**  for our area or even like he talked about a standalone deal that was at the right spot  or something i think that that's a great thing that he's been a pioneer on was is those kinds  of smaller processing plants um that was that was probably the most interesting part plus  
**[1:04:53-1:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:04:53):**  um of that podcast he was very upfront that if you try to get into a wholesale market  with that kind of a deal they will eat you alive he was very direct stay stay direct  to consumer if at all possible um if you can pick up some restaurants all well and good  
**[1:05:07-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:05:07):**  or like in our case you know a campground is a great deal but um the wholesale deal  stay away from so that's why we're trying to stay small enough we're not worrying about  wholesaling meat because i don't think it's possible to be profitable and that invite  
**[1:05:21-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:05:21):**  made that very clear so i and that's a great point you know because as soon as you get  it'll work for a while but as soon as you start doing the volume that one of the biggies  notice you yeah it's over you're done they're gonna shut you down yeah you won't be able  
**[1:05:37-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:05:37):**  to compete clearly i mean if mike califrag couldn't compete for all those years with  full feed lots of cattle and everything i mean when they decided to shut him down and  not buy his cattle that's just what they did and um so yeah you're absolutely right you  
**[1:05:49-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:05:49):**  just yeah you learned i i think the goal should be if we think this food system isn't right  and mike is completely right on that i read a lot of his blogs and he's talking a lot  about the local and regional food systems um so we don't think this food system is right  
**[1:06:04-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:06:04):**  at all so we shouldn't be selling into the wholesale market we should be trying to avoid  that deal at all costs and we should just be building it from the ground up unfortunately  that's what it looks like um it would be nice to see some people trying to come in and be  
**[1:06:17-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:06:17):**  conglomerators who don't make us all reinvent the wheel from the very beginning because  not everybody wants to do that i've got my wheels spinning so mike and i have been corresponding  so i think there's opportunities out there like i was so excited  
**[1:06:37-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:06:37):**  so what have you been talking to mike about ck um okay so you know secret plans um it's  not really a secret it's just kind of daydreaming at this point but uh so we're gonna be moving  back to idaho late this summer and joe will be doing the food animal veterinary practice  
**[1:06:54-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:06:54):**  i want him to get a usda certification so he can approve the slaughters um and then  he has you know he has five brothers and and four sisters and they all need jobs so i'm  i was thinking about maybe we get this butcher unit and have them outfit it and i actually  
**[1:07:14-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:07:14):**  pitched the idea to to his brothers them being like you know equal investors um they were  super excited about it i think we're gonna we're gonna try to do that in like the boise  area and have the marketplace there um since you'll have the traffic um and then i've just  
**[1:07:31-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:07:31):**  been kind of asking mike where he went to get the the msus i think that that charity  organization is not in in practice any longer so i went to freeze that work brian sent me  as well and looked at their their units um and i think um i think in the pasture map  
**[1:07:51-1:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:07:51):**  soil works natural capital side too they're looking at investing in mobile butchers too  for texas so i mean i know montana is looking to do it some people in virginia were looking  to do it so i think because of covid and what you're saying and i think just just rural  
**[1:08:07-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:08:07):**  food security it makes sense to take back that power couldn't agree more i'd love to  see you and a lot of other people do stuff like that i think if we could i think we can  start a whole new entrepreneur class absolutely centered around that and and you know how  
**[1:08:24-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:08:24):**  long has it been since you could really be a true entrepreneur in agriculture because  yeah it's been since before my time i'm 48 years old and trying to get started in any  facet of whether you wanted to open a butcher plant or whether you wanted to start a farm  
**[1:08:38-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:08:38):**  boy it's just almost impossible and that's what's so exciting about this that we see  people like yourself that could they're thinking their rails are spinning they're ready to  go out and do something that's what we need yeah so what are some other things that people  
**[1:08:53-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:08:53):**  can do to start moving the needle i mean we've covered a lot um you know what are some other  ways what are some other unexplored avenues that we could be using to to get our message  out chad anything come up for you well you know for us obviously the campground stuff  
**[1:09:09-1:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:09:09):**  is going to be primary um yeah we i think it's pretty hard to get much traction on lots  of social media i think we can go out and make posts and have a nice good farm page  and everything else but that doesn't necessarily move the needle a lot for a lot of people  
**[1:09:29-1:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:09:29):**  excuse me i think it takes some real direct interaction um whether we're going to them  or they're coming to us so for me that's what it's going to be is the direct interaction  well how do you think we can get more of that as these paradigms change i think we get more  
**[1:09:50-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:09:50):**  of it by appealing to what people want to do differently as people are able to go out  and work remotely um and and travel more and but maybe fly less because that's obviously  going to be the case i think that's i mean that's our goal clearly that's our focus um  
**[1:10:08-1:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:10:08):**  a again if you if you decide to go to farmers markets you only see a certain number of people  and so you the goal really should be to try to get out to as wide of a base as possible  and um building something that appeals to people to come to you whether it's on one  
**[1:10:24-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:10:24):**  primitive site or whether it's a bunch of them i think makes sense i think that's how  you do it okay so i'm kind of curious now so what's been your biggest wreck besides  the flood what's been your your the biggest management induced wreck and what what did  
**[1:10:47-1:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:10:47):**  it teach you that's the fun part about this holistic management business right every every  screw up you make just shows up in glaring detail because there's there's i mean you  can't blame anybody else you're the one that left the cows on too long for sure and that  
**[1:11:06-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:11:06):**  probably my most ongoing management challenge anyway and it's been a wreck at times has  been to not move cows fast enough to take too much and leave enough residue and especially  you know there again as we got into flood situations all of a sudden 600 acres of farm  
**[1:11:23-1:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:11:23):**  ground are out of production and you're faced with colon and you're faced with not in there  as much forage resources as you thought you had and um that the tendency to doodle over  and try to get all you can get out of the grass has been my biggest single challenge  
**[1:11:41-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:11:41):**  through this whole process and i am i am i start out each season reminding myself to  not let that happen again and i i'm going to figure out a way to get it tattooed on  my eyelids at some point just just because that's i think that's the biggest challenge  
**[1:11:56-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:11:56):**  that a lot of people get into other than that as we went through the floods i with all of  that ground there was all of a sudden out of production we were faced with having to  reclaim it we were faced with it just not being anything at all making decisions quicker  
**[1:12:19-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:12:19):**  and this is where some of the ranching for profit stuff would help i think for for my  situation making the decisions to call quicker in retrospect i should have sold an awful lot  of animals in november of 18 and instead i held on to my original marketing plan and and  
**[1:12:37-1:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:12:37):**  unfortunately we got into a really wet winter in 18 too we had a wet summer in 18 and then another  one in 19 but the winter was wet and we actually had springs opening up on the hillsides and  springs popping up where we didn't used to have them at first you're like oh this is pretty  
**[1:12:51-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:12:51):**  exciting because this stuff is working and then you realize that um you've got a real mess because  cows are getting stuck in the mud and it's just a miserable it was a miserable winter the winter of  18 and that was i guess that was a wreck as far as i was concerned no matter what would have happened  
**[1:13:07-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:13:07):**  on that um i should have if i would have known what i know now i would have sent a lot of animals  to the sale that we should have called quicker managing in a crisis is tough and that's part of  what's been interesting watching people who have never managed in a crisis politicians try to  
**[1:13:25-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:13:25):**  manage their way through covet um a couple of years of managing through crisis like we've seen  out here and you're like oh well sometimes you just have to stop and wait and see because you  don't know you don't know the right answer and there might not even be a right answer you just  
**[1:13:37-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:13:37):**  have to make a decision based off the best information at the time and if you're wrong  you live with consequences if you screw the field up you think well i'm gonna try to fix it next year  and go back and do it again and if you screw it up bad enough and it upsets you that much  
**[1:13:53-1:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:13:53):**  don't go over there stay away i heard you talk about that lane that you thought you'd screwed  up and then you went back and it was totally fixed and we've got some areas like that where  i thought man i don't even want to see this and and then you go back and you think well that wasn't  
**[1:14:08-1:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:14:08):**  there as bad of a deal as like as it could have been yeah man that was worse yeah well then you  just don't go back there again for another year well maybe it's fixed maybe it's not and honestly  you know we break out some battles and paradigms on a pretty regular basis because i'm actually  
**[1:14:26-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:14:26):**  disking up ground right now um as part of this reclamation process if you haven't farmed ground  for two or three years and it's had water sitting on it for 18 or 24 months out of it and you've  had to graze cattle because that was the only thing green on the ranch at the time or the only  
**[1:14:41-1:14:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:14:41):**  extra forage you had um sometimes you just have to start all over that's the only thing i could  think to do i'm a no-tiller by nature but we pulled the disc out and started disking it up  to reclaim that ground and helped ourselves we proved last year we got better stands if we did  
**[1:14:55-1:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:14:55):**  that so sometimes it's a matter of throwing the whole rulebook out the window and doing stuff  that doesn't seem right at all that's you just live with those i love that you brought that up  because i feel like i've noticed in a lot of like the region ag groups of people like quitting the  
**[1:15:11-1:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:15:11):**  group because they're like man these holier than thou people are telling me what i shouldn't do  and that's not like the point of this group and um i don't know i just hear that common thread  and i'm like okay like you know sometimes you do things that aren't in your guidelines but  
**[1:15:26-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:15:26):**  but it makes sense for my context and what my needs are and that that's the point it's  more of a community than a rulebook i think it's like an 80 community i think we can all find  80 commonality out of the regenerative rulebook with any other producer but to get closer than  
**[1:15:46-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:15:46):**  that i think that you know you have to be you have to look real hard and find two very specific  operations that are extremely extremely similar i agree what what's the phrase that you use brian  about conception or contextually appropriate contextually appropriate management yeah  
**[1:16:04-1:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:16:04):**  i and i think that makes sense i mean we don't want to be like joel salatin because i can't mimic  that i don't have the same resources i don't have the same population base he doesn't have this he  can't do the things i'm going to be able to do but like you said 80 of the time we can agree that  
**[1:16:20-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:16:20):**  we're holistically working to make better decisions to make positive progress for the soil that's my  goal anyway and hope that everything else will kind of fall into place once we get to that point  and we can agree with that with most people gabe brown told me not to diss the ground i totally  
**[1:16:38-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:16:38):**  understand why they are against that kind of stuff but until you're living this life and you  look at those fields that have been flooded and plugged up and you think until you actually have  to make that decision it's it's a lot easier to just say oh no stick with the no-till and the  
**[1:16:51-1:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:16:51):**  chemicals but when push comes to self sometimes you you have to make changes you just do you do  what's appropriate and we'll get back to it um tearing up that ground is going to be a good thing  because now it'll be in good production and then we'll get back to the no-till and and our regular  
**[1:17:04-1:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:17:04):**  crop rotation on it and it'll be it'll be the right thing to have done i hope so that'll be  covered that'll be high density grazing cover crops right yeah yeah yep yep we do an oak cover  crop in the spring and then um usually what we're going to be doing the oats it's an oat based cover  
**[1:17:21-1:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:17:21):**  crop obviously it's got a whole bunch of other stuff in there and then we'll try to do a wheat  one also in the fall and graze both of those out and then the next year we'll go in with a  summer-based feed mix that it will graze either either graze or stockpile so that's basically

**[1:17:58-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:17:58):**  wanted to see um we also have not been able to do it as as consistently as we wanted to because  we were fighting the floods and so it's been and we don't track things like daily gains or anything  obviously with the cows um but we we saw enough of the progress to feel like we were on the right  
**[1:18:16-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:18:16):**  track we it sure feels a lot better than the typical the way we were doing it anyway um  and and as far as the rest of it the fact that we were rotationally grazing and doing the other  management is what's allowed us to keep the cows out here that we've still got we didn't have to  
**[1:18:31-1:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:18:31):**  liquidate as many cows we didn't have when we lost all that production so yeah we definitely and and  again we had we went through a rainy period but we saw we saw springs that were supposed to be  springs that had stopped come back online and haven't stopped since so we feel like we feel  
**[1:18:47-1:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:18:47):**  like there's some positive things there that that we could already see the water cycle was starting  to respond to us we live the water cycle on this place because the river is right here we have lots  of spring in addition to the river we have about two miles of spring-fed creeks that feed into the  
**[1:19:01-1:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:19:01):**  river and so when that stuff all kind of went away when spring started drying up i thought i  gotta figure out what i'm doing wrong here and and to have those come back up um is is wonderful  because we don't we only have one windmill on the whole ranch we don't pump it it's we water out of  
**[1:19:16-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:19:16):**  live water year round and so um we live that water cycle and that's where we saw it first for sure  wow that's i've got quite a bit of live water on my place uh but i also pump a lot i i'm probably  60 to 70 percent of my water is is all pumped water during the growing season but you know  
**[1:19:39-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:19:39):**  when it's when it's dormant and it's cold i like to put them down on the creek so i don't so much  have to worry about going out and beating ice out of tanks with a freaking sledgehammer so yeah  what's the best advice you wish that you had gotten on day one of ranching  
**[1:19:56-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:19:56):**  well move your cows i guess move your cows more often the advent of polybraid makes that whole  deal look differently than back when i first started doing it because it wasn't as polybraid  wasn't as readily accessible um and all of that stuff is good i you know since we started since  
**[1:20:16-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:20:16):**  i started kind of down this process with kitt farrow uh the easy thing is to just keep going  i don't know if that's the most important thing to do is to move to ranching in sync with nature  whatever that looks like on your place for us typically we calve in may and june we actually  
**[1:20:33-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:20:33):**  have some early calvers this year due to covid um changes that we made um and that reminded me  why i don't calve calving during the the polar vortex or right before the polar vortex right  after i didn't have any during the cold weather but calving during that time reminded me why i  
**[1:20:48-1:21:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:20:48):**  can't have in may and june and so calving in sync with nature i think is a huge thing  there's a few different things that our goal ultimately typically we would retain 100 of our  heifers and roll them into the breeding herd and whatever gets bred gets bred and gets retained and  
**[1:21:06-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:21:06):**  what doesn't get bred would go into meat production for what's going to be campground meat sales  and i really like that model i've worked that model as a banker  versus comparing it to having to buy your own replacements and everything i love that model  
**[1:21:21-1:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:21:21):**  that's the one thing that i would do different from day one probably is just retain all heifers  and keep that pipeline really full all the time those heifers um for me that's that's something  we don't talk about regenerative agriculture very much but for me that's a smart profit decision  
**[1:21:37-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:21:37):**  that's a ranching for profit decision actually is for for me personally um and then the other  side of the regenerative act stuff if you can make two ranches out of one just because you move your  cows every day why wouldn't you do that um so to me this is a great opportunity a great time  
**[1:21:54-1:22:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:21:54):**  you can meld a whole bunch of really cool information that's out there and come up with a  pretty cool ranch by the time you're done especially somebody like uck that's talking about  getting into a different business or something like that um you've got so many more so much more  
**[1:22:07-1:22:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:22:07):**  knowledge out there than we had 20 years ago on this stuff yeah yeah it's been really fun um  i feel like when i first wanted to get an ag it was a conventional paradigm i felt like there was  not a lot of hope there were not a lot of opportunities and it wasn't even just because i  
**[1:22:25-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:22:25):**  was a woman like i had nothing to do with that because i knew once i can show up to a room i'd  always gonna outperform the men anyways um that's joking uh but but i felt like man i can't afford  land i can't afford cattle i can i can make the consulting decisions yes but but is that really  
**[1:22:43-1:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:22:43):**  what i want to do and now i feel like because of covid and because of regenerative ag there's been  these perspectives that have made like maybe legacy thinking people realize you need to invest  in the youth because they're the ones that have the creativity the innovation and the motivation  
**[1:23:03-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:23:03):**  to do things and so that we can figure out like what you said to turn two ranches into one  i think you know the reason that the next generation doesn't move on to take over for their  family is because they don't have a place for them right they're they can't afford to take care of  
**[1:23:22-1:23:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:23:22):**  two or three families and so you know what they should have done has been like can you can you  figure out a way to build stack an enterprise so that we can afford to keep you like let me give  you that so you can make that decision instead of just saying no so yeah agreed and that's why i'm  
**[1:23:38-1:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:23:38):**  where i am because my dad's place couldn't couldn't add an extra person knowing what i know now it's  closer to being able to for sure and i completely agree with you about the young people that are  why we're kind of looking for somebody to to run that part of it because i think the energy they  
**[1:23:54-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:23:54):**  bring to something like especially the soil health and regenerative agriculture movement  i think that can be done so well by a 20 and 30 year old that's got the energy to go out and do  things and really really see those things accomplished it's not that i don't want to  
**[1:24:11-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:24:11):**  i enjoy that stuff but um when you're getting pulled into a hospitality enterprise and also  got some other interests that are totally off farm and way out there um i don't necessarily  want to be 70 years old and moving cows i just don't exactly i think it's more fun to find  
**[1:24:26-1:24:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:24:26):**  somebody else let them get their operation up and going um and then we'll work together on this  thing and see where the future takes us ultimately we probably approach um the the planning for the  future a little differently than a lot of places because we're not a long-term plan but we're not  
**[1:24:46-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:24:46):**  multi-generation ranch here um we're we're actually probably angling more towards a community of  like-minded individuals who want to gather here and and do something you know whether it's an  intentional community that's focused on regenerative agriculture or does other stuff um eventually  
**[1:25:05-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:25:05):**  given our location and the beauty of the area and who the type of people we can attract um holistic  health healing type places would would just be a natural for this and so c2c holistic healing  spa on the banks of the seline river and that's exactly right i mean there's there's no reason  
**[1:25:27-1:25:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:25:27):**  that that stuff won't be very very not just popular but needed down the road here i mean i  i think that that's if we're going to build something really different and try to blow out  some paradigms let's go ahead and do it let's blow them all out and try something really different so  
**[1:25:43-1:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:25:43):**  that's kind of kind of why we're approaching this um i'm not as worried about about estate planning  as much as i am figuring out how to set up an organization that could be doing some real good  in a hundred years way after i'm forgotten um by whoever does it because continuity of stewardship  
**[1:26:03-1:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:26:03):**  continuity of stewardship instead of continuity of ownership  right right yeah that's exactly right i mean nothing against my kids but um my my i've got  an 18 year old son he's about to graduate from high school and he was he was you know 12 10 to  
**[1:26:17-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:26:17):**  12 when we were running real big as farmers and and so he grew up on the tractor on the sprayer  on the combine that was fun stuff for him and then all of a sudden dad gets a wild hair and  completely changes everything so he's out there as an 18 year old going i don't know if i want  
**[1:26:32-1:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:26:32):**  to move kennels the rest of my life he likes he likes the equipment um and he totally understands  why i'm doing what i'm doing but still he's going to go find his own way in life and yeah if he  comes back here that's great if he if he decides this is a good solution and he wants to do it  
**[1:26:45-1:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:26:45):**  that's wonderful but it's also okay if he doesn't and because i found my own way in life that's  important that's the way it should be so we're more about trying to find people who can really  identify with what we're doing here who can see the vision and are willing to work towards it a  
**[1:27:01-1:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:27:01):**  little bit brian we need to have a retreat at chad's place hey we're ready yeah it's not real  far i think it's uh it only takes me like two and a half maybe 245 to get up there to chad's  yeah we went right by it like seriously we were right by it the last time we were going to rapid  
**[1:27:21-1:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:27:21):**  city i pointed to listeners who are listening in let's plan a ranching reboot retreat that's a great  idea and you know it's been we've actually talked to a couple of different people and some of the  leaders in this movement about doing something like that maybe not this year but next year doing  
**[1:27:40-1:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:27:40):**  some kind of a get-together you know whether it's a you want to call it a so i have something or  something i will make it happen i'm happy oh what idea did you just plant my head girl  no i'm serious i'm not kidding i'm ready i like i said it's it's ice how do you pronounce his  
**[1:28:00-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:28:00):**  last name seph it's good it's good it's good right he and i talked a little bit about it  because he's got a cool place in virginia and and it's talking about you know hosting some people  and i messaged him too i said hey we could do something like that and i've talked to gabe  
**[1:28:12-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:28:12):**  ground about coming down at different times so at some point um assuming we don't have floods and  all the other fun stuff to deal with we're hoping to be set up to do that exact thing we're not doing  everything right here at all um the the challenges the time challenges when you're trying to do all  
**[1:28:29-1:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:28:29):**  these different things are real but as we start to i'm not necessarily worried about having it  all right either i'd rather bring people down let people see it see the challenges and then  you know we can we can talk about how to do things better i don't think any of our operations are  
**[1:28:45-1:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:28:45):**  exactly where we want them to be and they probably never will be um to host something like that but  i'm all about it i'm i'd be thrilled to do something like that  oh i think we actually have seth it's on the schedule uh what is it so yeah he uh  
**[1:29:03-1:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:29:03):**  i think he might actually be the release after this one depends on how we do the schedule but  clearly seth will either be released next episode or in two episodes and if i change that later and  i forget to edit this episode you can send me some hate mail whoever's listening  
**[1:29:21-1:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:29:21):**  that would be a good one though i mean yeah good smart people that's the nice thing about this  deal there's some really good smart people at the leading it i guess if for lack of a better word  and you know if we can look past a lot of superficial things we can find a lot of common  
**[1:29:37-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:29:37):**  ground with a lot of people and like i was saying you know we need to be looking for that 80 common  ality instead of trying to find that 90 to 95 commonality or 100 commonality you know as long  as that 20 you disagree with isn't actively going the wrong direction it's going to be a  
**[1:29:59-1:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:29:59):**  relatively going the wrong direction just deal with it and deal and let's let's 80 of us get in  the same spot and get moving the same direction i agree i yeah i and i think you're right i think  that most of us who are who are actively practicing regenerative management or holistic  
**[1:30:20-1:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:30:20):**  management for us but if regenerative management specifically on the on the farm side of things  i think we you're right we can find common ground with with about any other producer out there who's  trying to do the same things the goal is to be as good of a steward as you can be and it's going to  
**[1:30:34-1:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:30:34):**  look different for you versus me that's that's because our operations are different and that's  that's okay and it's going to look for different for every one of your fence line neighbors in  every direction because everybody's going to have a subtly different management context absolutely  
**[1:30:50-1:31:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:30:50):**  absolutely i would love to have some neighbors who are doing this um do you have any um i have one  that i work with i've been um we've been running cows together now for over 11 years and he does  you know he does rotate um he doesn't over graze his products are still a little bit on the big  
**[1:31:10-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:31:10):**  side but uh he's on rented land so what's his incentive to go out there and spend a lot of his  time and labor putting out hot wire on electric fence when what he's doing works for his cost  structure whereas i'm on my own land and part of its least from the family partnership which is  
**[1:31:32-1:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:31:32):**  me and my dad my sister you know i've got to pay a fair wage i've got to pay a fair rate on that and  i want to try to maximize my production to keep my costs low so that's why i do some of the daily  moves in a strip graze sure does it make sense for me yeah that makes perfect sense for us we're kind  
**[1:31:54-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:31:54):**  of the prayers out here right now it feels like there's a few other operations probably in the  county i guess but nobody close that that's for the most part they all think we're crazy they're  still very very traditionally wheat corn milo run the cows i've been that guy it's okay yeah and i  
**[1:32:13-1:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:32:13):**  have i mean i came up as that guy and you could go you could go out to the internet and find  arguments that i've written that are probably not much more than about seven or eight years old  justifying the use of the gmos and the chemicals and that's nothing that's not a negative at all  
**[1:32:28-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:32:28):**  it's just more like once you're once your focus shifts on that you just approach it all  differently and it would be it'd be nice to have some neighbors that can start to see some of that  but we can admit that we didn't know everything and that we've learned something the the key to  
**[1:32:44-1:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:32:44):**  this whole thing was me looking myself in the mirror and saying you're not profitable you're  gonna have to figure this out and so we went on a search for the truth and this is where we landed  is it a banker i can tell you most people don't want to ask that question until you're forced to  
**[1:32:59-1:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:32:59):**  until the banker says you are not going to make this another year and then then there may be a  little bit more open but um i don't know it's a real challenge to change minds on that and that's  okay um if it's working for them that's the way it works for now anyway we'll see what happens  
**[1:33:16-1:33:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:33:16):**  as supply chains change i know brian you're into the supply chain thing quite a bit um as if diesel  if diesel doubles or like you know phosphorus all of a sudden gets hard to get hold of because  the mine in florida is poisoning the gulf oh yeah that's that's going to change some things for  
**[1:33:32-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:33:32):**  western kansas wheat producers if phosphorus triples in cost and it very well could um do  all this so are you ready for the latest one i saw this today so we've been having like semiconductor  shortages have been kind of bubbling around if you know where to look all all most major

**[1:34:15-1:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:34:15):**  oh yeah who knows but your supply chain has been disrupted over and over again that's exactly right  and you know since we don't make tires in america anymore you can't get them  continuing supply chain disruptions i'm telling you i'm every week we talk to  
**[1:34:32-1:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:34:32):**  new new beautiful people but it makes me more and more becoming a a prepper like i need to be  100 self-sufficient by next year it's a good goal because you can sound like a conspiracy  for us real quickly if you start following some of this stuff around its source but the truth is  
**[1:34:59-1:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:34:59):**  it's hard to ignore the fact that we should probably be prepared to be able to live  independently for a while you know most of us would have no idea of what to do if the electrical  grid went down for any length of time i would thrive would you um i think i would  
**[1:35:14-1:35:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:35:14):**  i think i would uh i might not do well  i might not do well if the power went down i mean as long as the as long as the light stay on and  the fuel keeps flowing you know things things are pretty rosy but you know when the lights go out  
**[1:35:35-1:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:35:35):**  and i can't keep my bulk tanks full anymore that's when it's time to go to the hills  yeah there's going to be problems then i agreed and for most of us that would be the case most  of us i don't want to do without you know technology at all much less something as basic  
**[1:35:50-1:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:35:50):**  as electricity at this point in time hey think about that you know my dad remembers getting  power out where he grew up in in rural goth county so we've only been like this for a generation  generation and a half but we're very reliant on stuff like that for sure and it's only been the  
**[1:36:06-1:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:36:06):**  last 15 years i mean smartphones have been around for 15 years they've really only been kind of mass  for about the last 10 but you know in the last 10 years everybody carries around the super computer  in their pocket that is connected to literally every repository of information in the world like  
**[1:36:28-1:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:36:28):**  exactly there's no excuse to not be educated about a subject exactly yep when you can carry a third  brain on your pocket that accesses the the totality of human knowledge and basically  instantaneously you're right you might as well you can be informed and you can be educated on  
**[1:36:47-1:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:36:47):**  all this stuff agreed it's changed everything  wow i don't know where to go from there but i don't think we've left a whole lot on the table  today i understand is uh is there anything you want to ask me or ck chad  
**[1:37:05-1:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:37:05):**  yeah if i heard you ask this question i'm kind of curious if you could  have ramshed anywhere you wanted to where would you go oh gosh  i should have known this one was going to come up  
**[1:37:19-1:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:37:19):**  you know it it'd be real hard for me to want to leave my red hills honestly  there's a lot of you know there's some negatives there's some cons  but the pros are i've been walking the walk in the soil and learning the soil for 30 years  
**[1:37:37-1:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:37:37):**  right and i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that but i'm not sure if i'm going to be able  to do that for 30 years right so that's that's worth something and i've put a lot of time and a  lot of i put a lot of time and a lot of blood and a lot of love into into cleaning it up and you  
**[1:37:55-1:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:37:55):**  know so did my father not to take anything away from what he did i don't know i don't know  i'd want to go somewhere where there's maybe a little more elevation a little more consistent  and a little more grass production so they don't have to be so spread out so big to to make a living  
**[1:38:15-1:38:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:38:15):**  for one guy um i don't know maybe a little more in your country is tough for those of us from  even i'm just from a slightly wetter environment but i would have a hard time going to your country  and wanting to ranch because of that rainfall situation it's oh well 22 24 26 is kind of where  
**[1:38:34-1:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:38:34):**  the normal-ish range is but you know how much of that we get in the dormant versus growing season  you know that's always a question and the timing you know like we talked about timing during  during the growing season can matter a whole bunch and then timing of sun oh yeah so you know there's  
**[1:38:53-1:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:38:53):**  it's challenging everywhere i mean everybody's gonna have to deal with some weather crap and  and changing environment from year to year and you have to have the contextually appropriate  management that is adaptable sure and and not dogmatic and systematic to your environment  
**[1:39:12-1:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:39:12):**  right when we were going through the inheritance process of the ranch and  before things were even fully settled it was such a mess it was such a challenging time there was  some times i was like i just don't know if i'm gonna want to stay around here and so i actually  
**[1:39:27-1:39:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:39:27):**  put your question that you've been asking people um if you could ranch anywhere i actually put that  into practice and started kind of researching all right if i sold this place once we're done  where would i go um and what i found was about every place that looked real promising to me  
**[1:39:45-1:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:39:45):**  had some real serious challenges out there and i knew my own challenges like you said brian you've  been walking your own fields for a long time i knew these challenges a lot better and you know  like one of the places that i picked up that would have just been a beautiful place up on a big river  
**[1:39:58-1:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:39:58):**  in nebraska up on the niguera when they when we had our big floods they had big floods with ice  flows um they had challenges come through that area that i wouldn't want to go through um and  so you know i remember seeing those pictures that did not look like fun yeah no the floods are hard  
**[1:40:17-1:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:40:17):**  enough to clean up after floods with feet of ice in them would be things i don't even want to think  about so yeah i kind of came to the same conclusion it was easier to stay where i was at and because  i understood these challenges but like ck you've been everywhere then and you're a lot less tied  
**[1:40:31-1:40:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:40:31):**  down than he and i are yeah would you go it's so funny okay so i've i've been to ranches in  new york the carolinas florida louisiana texas great plains nebraska love the sand hills i don't  think i would survive those winters i'm sorry i'm with you there that's where we're going to go  
**[1:40:52-1:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:40:52):**  because that's where joel's family is um but if i could pick anywhere with stipulations that there  wasn't regulations it'd be northern california it would be northern california by the foothills so  that i could have summer summer grazing in the valley and then had then send them to the mountains  
**[1:41:09-1:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:41:09):**  because you're going to run all the californians out so you don't have the regulations right yeah  i don't i don't want the regulations i don't want the land prices yeah yeah so yeah california is  a great place i mean it's beautiful the only problem is it's full of californians and they  
**[1:41:25-1:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:41:25):**  ruined it exactly and i'm one of them yeah so i'm from california but i left because because i felt  like there wasn't a lot of opportunities uh so that's why we left you know and you know we met  a ton of people from specifically like la and the big cities of california this last summer  
**[1:41:45-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:41:45):**  and i was surprised by how much in common we had with them too they it's not like they're from  another planet by any means um they just have a lot different focus of their reality um and that's  how we all work right we we know our own reality best and that's it so but yeah we again we could  
**[1:42:03-1:42:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:42:03):**  find commonality at least 60 or 75 commonality with almost everybody that came down the driveway  from out there because at the end of the day they still worry about the same things that we worried  about you know yep healthy land happy families thriving communities yeah yeah  
**[1:42:22-1:42:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/11--Chad-Tuttle-Down-the-Regenerative-Rabbit-Hole-e1021ia#t=1:42:22):**  i think that's a great place to end chad it's been an absolute uh it's been a blast having  you on today it's been a great conversation i've enjoyed it as well thank you to both of you yeah  it's been amazing well gang radall's rancher here thanks for riding with us for another great

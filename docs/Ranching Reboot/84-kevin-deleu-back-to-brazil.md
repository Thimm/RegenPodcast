So here we go with episode 84.  Well, I think I got all the right buttons pushed. How are you today, man?  Good. Good. Just hanging in there. Caught calves dropping on the ground and bailing hay and just  
**[0:02:04-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:02:04):**  busy, busy. Well, thanks for being here. I don't know how much of an intro I'm going to edit in  in front of this later. So why don't you tell us who you are and where you're at real quick.  Yeah. So I'm Kevin De Lue. I live on my family's operation in Collinsville, Texas,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:02:20):**  where my parents are reining horse trainers and I just do registered Angus.  And it's just me and my mom and dad. Okay. Just doing our thing.  How long have you guys been there? So we've been in Collinsville since 1996.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:02:36):**  We're originally from Brazil. My mom's American. My dad's Brazilian. And I was born there in  Sao Paulo and we had a ranch in the state of Sao Paulo. And we moved here in 1996. My parents  lived there together, probably eight, nine years, eight or nine years before that. And  
**[0:02:56-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:02:56):**  so did your mom was your mom in Brazil and that's where she met your dad?  No. So my grandfather, my dad's dad had a fabric factory in the city of Sao Paulo and he wanted  all his kids to work there. My dad didn't want to, he wanted to work with horses. So he saved  
**[0:03:14-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:03:14):**  up whatever money could sold his car and he moved to the United States and he was working at a ranch  in Illinois and he was just picking stalls, just doing dirty work. And at one point he was just  sick of the cold and he was like, you know, I'm out of here. I, this isn't going to work. I came  
**[0:03:31-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:03:31):**  to learn to ride. And the guy was like, well, this way, you know, I got a girl coming to,  to help train and stuff. She's won the Appaloosa world and whatnot.  He was like, fine. Well, it turned out to be my mom. And so pretty much ever since then,  
**[0:03:47-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:03:47):**  that was back in the eighties, I think early eighties and ever since then just took off.  Okay. And then and so then my mom and my dad had to go back to Brazil cause of visa.  Then my mom ended up moving to Brazil with him and they built a ranch there and did their thing.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:04:07):**  Okay. So if they had a ranch in Brazil, why did they come back to the States?  Uh, well for me, uh, so that way I, cause we, where we lived, I mean, it was  the road now for us to drive from Sao Paulo to there, it's about two hours, but you know,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:04:23):**  back in the day it was a lot longer and there's no, you know, not a good hospital, no good school.  And cause where we lived was pretty much a village and next to a kind of next to a small city, but  like not good electricity. Yeah. Uh, I mean, there's electricity running water and stuff, but,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:04:43):**  uh, Brazil, the infrastructure in Brazil is a lot, a lot different, especially the education.  They wanted me to have a good education stuff. And, uh, there was a couple of times when I was  a baby that I got sick and I think that kind of scared them, you know, if I got sick and where  
**[0:04:58-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:04:58):**  they were, you know, if something bad happened, they couldn't. Yeah. If it's, if it's two hours to,  you know, any kind of PJ pediatric care on the best of days, it's like in rainy season.  Oh, well, cause one time, uh, my, our, we had a window propped up with a book and I,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:05:15):**  I had all my fingers and I mean, I was two years old at this point, had all my fingers there in  the window, dropped on my fingers and broke all four of my fingers. And, you know, you can imagine  my parents live in two hours away from the nearest hospital kind of deal. Yeah. That's less than  
**[0:05:30-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:05:30):**  ideal. Yeah. Yeah. You can imagine. So they came back to the States in 96. Did you guys,  you came back to, did you, okay. My brain's getting in front of me again. Did your parents  come back to Collinsville? Is that, is that where they landed, where you've been ever since,  
**[0:05:47-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:05:47):**  or was there some other intermediate stops? Nope. Uh, we've lived here on the ranch since 96.  When they bought the property, it was just a house, a shed behind it and a small pond. And  we just expanded and we're at 130 acres now. And, uh, most of it's all in the same area. We,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:06:09):**  we have two, uh, uh, 45 acres of hay pasture, just half a mile down the road. Okay. And that's  actually where my house is. We have a mobile home here that used to be for workers and I live in  here now. So it's nice living close to the farm or close to the ranch. I have like an eight mile  
**[0:06:30-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:06:30):**  commute, which is kind of, it's nice because I can work at work, but I leave work at work and  it's not like, you know, it's, it's kind of hard for me to get motivated to go back out in the  cool of the evening, go work in the shop or go do something. Cause yeah, it's eight miles, takes 12  
**[0:06:46-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:06:46):**  minutes, half hour round trip. Yeah. I mean, I ideally it all done in one trip, I guess is what  I'm saying. Yeah. It was where we're hoping. Cause right now there's so many people moving in around  here. The price of land is going up. We're hoping to sell some of like our hay land at some point  
**[0:07:02-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:07:02):**  and be able to sell that and get some more property. You know, if it's gotta be a little  bit of a commute, that's not a problem, but, uh, try and get some more land at least to be able to  have some more cows out on. So without looking at a map Collinsville is, is where from DFW Metro?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:07:19):**  It pretty much straight North. Um, yeah, I, if you take I 35 go up North we're in between, uh,  Sherman and Gainesville practically. If you look on the side of the highway, uh,  East side of I 35. Okay. And then West of I 75, they go through Sherman.  
**[0:07:41-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:07:41):**  Well, just because we're probably going to give him a shout out anyway, that's not too far away  from, from our friend Richard hat Creek farms over indicator. Yeah. So he would be, he's West of me  probably about 40, I think 40 minutes West of me. Okay. So, um, now let's see, where do we go?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:08:01):**  You said you're at a registered Angus now, but, uh, you know, doing a little bit of Facebook  stocking about, you know, I don't know an hour ago, just after you approved my friend request  and then looking at your Instagram, um, you haven't always been in Angus, have you? No.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:08:16):**  So, you know, like I said, my parents are horse trainers and I wasn't able to get in the horses  quite as, you know, quite as well as them. And  there's so much work and they're so expensive and, you know, I'm not judging you. I'm not a  
**[0:08:36-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:08:36):**  horse guy either. Well, they get, you know, and they get hurt so easily and stuff and just watching  my parents go through that growing up. And I don't know once, uh, cause once I started ninth grade  in high school, I joined FFA and we decided to get me a heifer to show. And, uh, we were looking  
**[0:08:55-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:08:55):**  around and we actually started, I started with Brahmas. I started, um, bought a heifer, bought  another heifer, and then we started buying some cows and that's where I started with Brahmas.  Well, so in Brazil, we have friends that are Brahma breeders and just knowing them and also  
**[0:09:15-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:09:15):**  growing up, I always liked Zebu cattle. Every time we'd go to Brazil to visit, we'd go to, uh,  sometimes we go to a cattle show there because in Brazil and South America, it's primarily going to  be Nalori cattle, just all Zebu pretty much. Okay. So, um, let's spend a minute and kind of  
**[0:09:33-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:09:33):**  unpack that a little bit. Uh, Zebu, is that an African breed? So when I say Zebu, it's, um,  kind of like all the breeds that encompass boss Indicus cattle. So it'll be Nalori, uh,  Guzera, which would be, they look like Brahmas, but they have the big horns that go straight up,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:09:55):**  not like what to see. So there's nothing, nothing has, yeah, no, no. So there's Nalori, Guzera,  there's a jeer or, uh, in those pronounce a gear sometimes. Um, there's the bop one there's, uh,  uh, Sinji and, uh, Indu Brazil. There's a bunch of different ones and they're all considered Zebu  
**[0:10:22-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:10:22):**  breeds. So like in Brazil, the association there, um, is a Zebu association of Brazil.  Is what they call it. It's kind of like an amalgamation of Indicus bloodlines.  Yes. Yeah. Okay. And then like when you see many Zebu cattle, I don't even, I think that is what  
**[0:10:43-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:10:43):**  they're called. I don't know if there's a specific breed to them or anything, but they call many Zebu,  but it's just cause they're miniature boss Indicus cattle. So back to the question,  why did you start with Brahma? So we had kind of the Lehman Charlet is down the road. So  
**[0:11:06-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:11:06):**  we were thinking about maybe Charlet and we were in Whitesboro and there was a trailer full of  Brahmas and they were going to a Brahma show in a town called Greenville, like an hour and a half  from here. We're like, you know, let's go to, let's go check it out there and go see it. One of my  
**[0:11:22-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:11:22):**  dad's best friends in Brazil, he's a, he was a Brahma breeder and, uh, just kind of talked with  him and stuff. And we went and visited ranch there. And one thing I didn't really want to  deal with was all the, uh, the blow drying the hair. You know, I can deal with brushing them,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:11:38):**  but not, you know, a beauty pageant kind of deal with it. I can get that. Yeah. And so I just  got a Brahma heifer as a first show heifer and that was an experience all in its own, but, uh,  yeah. And then from there just kind of took off. We love doing it. And  
**[0:12:00-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:12:00):**  my dad was really into it also right there with me. And, uh, yeah, it's kind of, it kind of  sticking to our Brazilian kind of roots with it as well. Trying to as much as we could.  I kind of wondered if it had something to do with that.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:12:14):**  Yeah. Yeah. I think that had a big, you know, big part to do with that also, but.  So since we're talking about breeds, why'd you transition to Angus?  Oh man, I could go on a long time about that. Uh, the biggest thing for me is that the Brahma breed  
**[0:12:33-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:12:33):**  is really focused on the show ring. And another thing is that  you can't really better your genetics as well as you can other breeds.  Um, semen sales, for instance, in the Brahma breed are really hindered.  
**[0:12:50-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:12:50):**  Uh, a lot of times they're the semen cells are foreign only.  Or if it's a way to, they control some ranches really control the market. So  okay. So they'll do it for an only, because the majority of the Brahma market is going to be south  
**[0:13:06-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:13:06):**  of the border. It's going to be in the tropical climates, you know, Mexico all the way south to  Brazil. And because of that, some ranches have majority of the control over the genetics here.  And so like in the show ring, you can go show against a bunch of bulls, but chances are,  
**[0:13:27-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:13:27):**  you don't have access to those genetics. You can maybe go buy a bull from those ranches,  but sometimes they're not going to sell you the best bull, or they may sell you a bull  and you're not allowed to sell semen domestically. And if you want to sell to a foreign country,  
**[0:13:47-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:13:47):**  they have to approve of what country that you sell to. And it's, it's, it's not going to be  a good thing to sell to you. And it's, it's really, they're trying to take care of their sandwich.  What was that? I'm sorry, they're trying to take care of their sandwich and not take a bite.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:14:07):**  And so because of that, once I learned how to AI, it just became so difficult because, you know,  I could buy semen on some bulls, it may be $250 a straw, and I can only buy 10 straws at a time at  a time. Well, if I only have, you know, maybe 10 cows to breed, and I have to buy so many straws  
**[0:14:30-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:14:30):**  to see me because Brahma is also aren't as fertile as like Angus. I've never heard that.  Well, it at least the show cattle, it can get that way. And so a problem that I saw with the Brahma  is because genetics are not allowed to be used openly, like it is an Angus, because an Angus,  
**[0:14:52-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:14:52):**  you know, you buy semen on whatever bull for practically 30 $40 a straw. And so because of  that, now they're doing a little bit better where they'll sell semen on a bull, but it'll be like  $1,000 unit $5,000 unit, some $25,000 unit. So what happens is that unit of semen you can only  
**[0:15:12-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:15:12):**  flush to right, right. And because the majority of the market is going to be centered around the show  ring, there's not a whole lot of emphasis on maternal value as much anymore. There's not as  much emphasis on carcass quality, and just what's going to win in the show ring. And because of that,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:15:37):**  I wanted to be able to raise my own seed stock cattle, I wanted to be able to raise cattle that  when I go out in the pasture, I'm proud of my production, other people are proud of my  production. And I could I could do that with the Brahmas. But the cost for me to do it was going to  
**[0:15:53-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:15:53):**  be I wasn't really going to see an actual return on investment in the long run.  Brian sounds like that would be Yeah, getting your own established Brahma genetics that are in demand  would be a long term project. And you'd have to, you know, fight against some other giants in the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:16:11):**  industry. One name comes to mind when I think of Brahma's, and I'm not going to say it. I think  we've talked about it before. I'd like to think that they're not that they're not doing that. But  if they are, I guess it's just business, right? Because what's tough is what a lot of American  
**[0:16:32-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:16:32):**  breeders started doing is going to Mexico and buying the American genetics already born there  and importing them here. Right. So there's a ton of bulls that are American genetics that I can buy  that were imported from Mexico. And a problem I see with that is all the money that's being spent  
**[0:16:52-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:16:52):**  in the Brahma industry here is going overseas. All that money should be going to American ranchers  here. You know, there shouldn't be $100,000 going to Mexico to bring a bull back, you know,  it should be going to an American rancher here that was able to raise their own cattle,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:17:12):**  be able to do that and support American ranchers, at least in the seed stock sector. And I feel like  if they were able to bring the price down on Brahma semen and actually have more of a market  for commercial operations to AI to Brahmas, we'd be able to see more consistency in the production  
**[0:17:34-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:17:34):**  of bulls instead of just seeing like, well, this bull he is his cell, he sells semen for $10,000  a straw. So every single calf that he produces going to be out of a good cow because it's only  going to be from a flush, right? You're not going to flush it a bad cow. So for me, I would rather  
**[0:17:52-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:17:52):**  see a bull. Take two bulls, for example, each bull has 100 progeny, one bull has 100 progeny out of  10 cows, and the other bull has 100 progeny out of 100 different commercial cows. And the bull  out of that has 100 progeny out of 100 different cows, I feel like you'd be able to get more of an  
**[0:18:13-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:18:13):**  idea of what his progeny are actually like if he's able to correct calves on certain traits.  I mean, I think with any bull and cow, I mean, even if you took your best cow and put her on  a copier and hit 100, made 100 identical copies of that cow and AI'd everything with the same semen,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:18:37):**  you're still going to have a wide range in your calf crop.  Yeah, exactly. Because I still have one Brahma cow, it was the first cow ever raised. She was  number two, number one was a bull calf. And she's produced a calf every year. I was able to get her  
**[0:18:52-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:18:52):**  AI pregnant at 14 months of age and got her bred back and she has drops a calf every year. And  now she is, she's going to be 15 next year. She's about to calf again right now. And she took the AI  and she's kept herself up, you know, has ideal feet, ideal teats, pretty much an ideal cow.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:19:14):**  She's not a perfect cow, but that's the kind of quality.  She even hasn't missed. I'd say she's pretty fricking good.  Yeah, exactly. And I've actually AI'd her twice to $700 unit semen and she took both times. So.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:19:29):**  Are you, have you stayed with Brahma on her? Have you tried crossbreeding out of her?  I've put my Angus bulls on her for the past several years and just F1 calves. And then I  ended up just taking the cell barn after. Okay.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:19:44):**  But actually I think she took now to, to Brahma semen. I did AI her once and put her with a bull.  But it looks like she, I think she took to the Brahma semen.  Okay.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:19:55):**  But we'll see. We'll see what comes out if it's black if it's a problem.  I know I've talked to some other folks like Brahma breeders and some,  Burke Teichert actually a couple of years ago said that there could be a lot of value in a  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:20:13):**  quarter indicus, a quarter Corriente and then half continental slash English.  A quarter Corriente?  Yeah.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:20:21):**  On them? Really?  For the natural selection and adaptation that they had around mostly in Copper Canyon and  in the desert Southwest for 400 years. Yeah.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:20:33):**  I don't think there's another breed that's as adapted or that has the genetic reservoir  of adaptation than as the Corriente does in North America.  You're you're I think you're right on that. Because the Brahmas are the Brahma is actually  
**[0:20:48-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:20:48):**  the first registered American breed. They're the first breed developed, you know, specifically for  the United States, which would have been, you know, back in the back in the day it was JD  Hudgens helped out a lot on that with their Manzo bloodline. And I think, you know, definitely  
**[0:21:08-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:21:08):**  with Brahma influence in the in the mix, at least.  We can't talk about JD Hudgens without saying hi to my friend John Coleman Locke. Hi, John.  No, of course. Of course. Of course.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:21:20):**  You know John, don't you?  Yeah. Yeah. Done business with John and yeah, really good guy.  Small world sometimes, isn't it? Isn't it strange? Like every every once in a while,  
**[0:21:29-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:21:29):**  you just get one of those those weird off connection. It's like, oh, yeah, so and so  you've known that guy for how long?  Yeah, there was a there's a Brazilian that went and did a halter braking class. And I stayed with  
**[0:21:44-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:21:44):**  John. I think it was in his guest house. And he let me borrow his truck and stuff to drive around.  And it was really, really nice family. It was really good people.  Was that fairly recently? Like within the last?  
**[0:21:56-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:21:56):**  No, that was gosh, I think I was still in high school at that point. That probably been 2010.  Oh, yeah. So you have a lot longer. I was just wondering when you were there,  if they're doing any of the high density, you know, multiple daily moves.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:22:11):**  I don't believe so. I listened to the podcast. I don't I don't remember. I don't think they were  at that point. And they I mean, they had some beautiful land out there. Yeah, that's prime  cattle country out there too. They've got some really good looking cows too.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:22:26):**  They the best they really do. I mean, they're, they they're the best Brahma breeders there are.  Their cattle are incomparable.  So let's pivot Angus, obviously, much more of a market improved genetic selection.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:22:42):**  Why else did you get into Angus and out of Brahma?  For one, well,  in the Brahma's there is, it was difficult for me to sell bulls. Whenever I had a bull calf,  
**[0:22:54-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:22:54):**  we pretty much just try to sell them at six months old if they weren't going to  look that good as a shovel. But with the Angus, I mean, I can start, I can start semen testing them  at 14 months of age. And I can already sell them at that age, I try not to just closer and maybe  
**[0:23:11-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:23:11):**  18 months and older. So that way, they're a little bit more, more, more, more, more,  not going to go out to the pasture breed cows and just lose everything and then completely  stunt their growth or anything like that. Right. Just from my experience, at least.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:23:28):**  Their pregnancy rates are a lot better. They're a lot easier for me to put in protocol and be able  to do a fixed time AI. And I can get I was able, I mean, they prolific breeders also,  compared to the Brahma's. I had a lot of times with with my Angus, at least I can drop a calf  
**[0:23:49-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:23:49):**  out of a cow every single year. But with the Brahma's sometimes it just, I'd have to AI,  put them with the bull, wait for that bull to get them bred and stuck. And with the Angus,  I mean, I was able to just multiply my cows almost, almost too much at one point.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:24:12):**  Right. And the difference between an 80% conception rate and a 95%, it doesn't sound like that much.  It doesn't sound like it'd be that bad to a lay person or somebody that's not in our industry.  But that 15% is off of make or break. Yeah. Or even between 80 and 90%. I mean, that 10%  
**[0:24:32-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:24:32):**  of your calf crop could be your make or break. Yeah, especially if you have a small herd like  I do. And you know, you need every cow bred because just one cow is eaten. So much, you know,  taking so much more resources away from the other cows that are that are producing and are doing  
**[0:24:49-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:24:49):**  well. And you just about open the door back up for the great hay war of TikTok. Oh, yeah.  Yeah. Man, that was fun. That's fun to watch. Maybe we'll get back into that later. I have  that written down. Okay. No problem. No problem with that. Oh, okay. So where do we go from here?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:25:16):**  What the, let's talk about your trip. Yeah. Let's talk about the trip. So we started,  I wish we'd been talking for a little over a month. And I got the I wanted to, I wanted to  talk to you into a podcast. And we started talking to her like, Hey, I've got this. What was it? A  
**[0:25:32-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:25:32):**  two week trip back to Brazil? Yeah, like 10 days. Yeah. Yeah. You told me you had that trip coming  up. I'm like, Oh, wait, let's do that. After you get down, you can talk about weird shit that you  saw down there. So, Oh, yeah, I don't even know where to start. So, let's see. Well, it's been  
**[0:25:51-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:25:51):**  eight years since I went back to Brazil. Last time I went was in 2014. And we used to visit every  single year. And I told my dad, because he's been wanting me to go back and visit. And I told him,  I was like, the Expo Genetica, which is a real big show. I was like, it's, it's going on next week.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:26:10):**  He was like, Oh, you think next week you think you can go? I was like, No, no, that's, that's  too quick. I got too much stuff to do. And then my dad went and just started doing his thing and  started calling people and pretty much set up the dates for me to go. It's like, all right, you  
**[0:26:24-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:26:24):**  know, calving is going to start right when I get back and might as well just go ahead and get it  over with. And so we set up with our friend Claudio and a Claudio Carvalho and he runs Navidad,  which is like a seed stock Nalori producer in Brazil. He's, we consider him the best  
**[0:26:48-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:26:48):**  Nalori breeder in Brazil, at least when it comes to seed stock genetics.  And just because I'm dumb, that's, that's one of the Zebu breeds.  Correct. Yeah. And that's the Nalori is to Brazil what Angus is to the US in terms of popularity.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:27:02):**  So if you, if you're in Brazil and you said, cow, somebody would think of a Nalori.  Yes. Okay. They wouldn't think of Angus or anything. They would think of a Nalori.  A lot of times when you say cow here in this country, people think of something  
**[0:27:15-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:27:15):**  black and white with horns, but yeah, exactly. Yeah. And and so we set it up with him for,  we have, you know, my dad has so many friends in Brazil, so I went there so that way I could also  visit my grandma. And we also have another friend, Paulo Marquez of Casa, Casa Branca  
**[0:27:37-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:27:37):**  ranch, which is probably two hours away from Sao Paulo. And he's a real big Nalori,  Brahma and Angus breeder. And he's one of the bigger Angus seed stock breeders in Brazil.  So on the first day we went and visited him. I, because I went by myself and my dad's best  
**[0:27:59-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:27:59):**  friend there, he drove me over there. And so we went and visited them the first day and then came  back. And then from there, I took another flight to Campo Grande, which is a city out in the  Pantanal area of Brazil, which is kind of like a it's it's south of the Amazon.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:28:19):**  Man, I don't know any Portuguese. If it was Spanish, like maybe I could kind of  catch some of the birds, but like Portuguese is.  So like you have the Amazon and the, and the area of the Amazon is called Matu Grosso down below it.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:28:35):**  And then below that is called the Pantanal. The Pantanal is it's like the Everglades,  right? But it's yeah, real swampy, but it's a lot of cattle country. And also down there,  there's a lot of it would be like Illinois also, when it comes to cropland, Illinois,  
**[0:28:56-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:28:56):**  you know, that whole area, all it is, is cropland, cropland and cattle land out there.  That's where most of the agriculture is. And so I was going to fly out there and stay with our friend,  with our friend, Claudio, for I think three, four days when I stayed there. And it wasn't a part of  
**[0:29:14-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:29:14):**  the trip, but we ended up being able to visit our other friend, which lived about an hour and a half  away, which was that really big ranch I went to was over, or it was about 100,000 acres at that  ranch of theirs. And they ran 20 to 25,000 head steers.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:29:33):**  Okay, what's really big ranch for 20 to 25,000 head of steers?  I mean, because, well, that guy has about 500,000 acres total. They're in Brazil,  Paraguay and Bolivia. And they run a total about 100,000 head. Because they're at that particular  
**[0:29:57-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:29:57):**  ranch, it's just steers. They don't have any mama cows out there.  Wow.  And they're really trying to implement more regenerative practices. And, you know, because  
**[0:30:12-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:30:12):**  out there, they can have a crop of corn, sorghum, and have the cattle raising it.  In the same year.  In the same year.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:30:22):**  That's wild. Let's put a pin in that, you know, regenerative pasture cropping grazing and  come back to that. Let's talk more about your trip.  Yeah, so, Clogino and Naviday, he has two ranches. The ranch I went to was the main one,  
**[0:30:43-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:30:43):**  and they have another one where closer to Sao Paulo. But at that place, they  run, I think he said 1000 cows there. And that's where he does most of his seed stock. And he has  his own feedlot there. And they do a lot of pasture rotations where they have the pastures  
**[0:31:09-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:31:09):**  pretty much already set up with electric fence. And they can rotate them all. And then the,  like at the four corners where the pastures will meet, they have a corral where they'll have the  water tank there. And right now it's been really dry. So they'll put hay in there. And what they'll  
**[0:31:26-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:31:26):**  do is let the cows graze for like half the day and then bring them in, because they have calves  on the side as well. So they'll bring them in, let them eat whatever hay they have there right  now. And then turn them back out for the next day and just keep rotating.  
**[0:31:42-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:31:42):**  Excuse me. And yeah, and out there, I mean, it's pretty much seed stock. But they also run a lot of  Angus crosses on their Nalori cows, where they AI'd Angus to their Nalori cows, retain those females.  And he's trying to make his own bringus. Would those be for export back to the US?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:32:10):**  You mean like, like beef products at least?  Yeah. Yeah. The, yeah, the beef from the Nalori Angus crosses.  Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, Angus is really starting to take off there at least for the crossbreeding  
**[0:32:26-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:32:26):**  because, you know, one they're black and they're got a lot of hair. So out there in Brazil,  they're going to be a lot more susceptible to ticks. Ticks are really bad in Brazil and they'll,  they'll, they'll tear a cow up real bad. And so just running straight Angus out there,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:32:44):**  it's not going to be ideal. So the cross at least to have a better carcass quality  is pretty much what their goal is right now.  That's kind of why I'm putting, you know, trying to put in some Angus and continental bloodline  
**[0:32:58-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:32:58):**  is just to make the carcasses that I have. They're good. They're small. They're efficient. They just  need to be a little bit bigger. And if I have to sacrifice a little bit of efficiency, I think I  can do that as long as I can go, you know, all the way to the wrong end of the efficiency scale,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:33:13):**  which is where I think a lot of, a lot of the industry is.  Are you talking about like grain efficiency or are you talking about like kind of grass efficiency?  For me, grain efficiency matters exactly zero because I don't have access to any of it. I  
**[0:33:27-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:33:27):**  don't grow any of it. Any of it has to be imported at great cost or stored in infrastructure that I  don't own. The resource I get is grass. Yep. That's what matters to me. And, you know,  we're looking at winter coming up and, you know, I'm a couple of hundred miles north of  
**[0:33:45-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:33:45):**  Yupyter, Kansas. So my winter situation looks completely different. I have stockpiled grass  to get through all winter, but what I don't have is protein in the forage. So I have to,  I still have to import that. What do you supplement for protein at least?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:34:02):**  Two years ago, tubs and stockpiled grass. And then when we had the snow, I, I hauled some feed hay  out and some alfalfa. We had, we had like 10 days of cold in, what was that? 21, 10, almost 14 days.  Didn't get above freezing. My Creek even froze up and it never freezes. Like, okay, gotcha. Like  
**[0:34:24-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:34:24):**  halfway into that deal, I was where it put my cows. They were the only ones on the ranch at the time.  I had a 16 foot stock tank. Okay. And a half a mile of Creek.  Me, you know, I sometimes I get focused on doing dumb things like, okay, every day I got to go out,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:34:43):**  I got to chop ice in the tank. Yeah. We made it through the first week. And then when it  started getting down like 10 below at night, I would go out just before dark and I'd open  the hole back up, come out the next morning and have to break, you know, six or eight  
**[0:34:57-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:34:57):**  inches ice back out of the tank. It got to the point where I was trying to, trying to break  nine inches of ice out of that tank. And I said, this is bullshit. I'm going to go look, see if the,  see if the creeks froze over. Gosh. Yeah. You said that was last year. That was 21. Yeah.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:35:13):**  Was that during that, that vortex, that winter vortex we got, cause I, we've never experienced  negative four at our place. And when I woke up to that, I mean, we, we didn't lose any animals  thankfully, but I mean, we had to work hard for the next like four or five days breaking ice and  
**[0:35:33-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:35:33):**  all the tanks. I mean, what I do is just, I have a big pitchfork and I'll just throw all the ice out  and then, because normally, you know, just break it, then it'll just, and it gets,  it seems like it gets a lot harder if you just leave the ice in while I take the ice out. Well,  
**[0:35:49-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:35:49):**  it was so cold. It's just ice right back up so quickly. I think there was one day  the wind was blowing like 25 miles an hour. And I was out there. I'm really strange. I take a big  sledgehammer and a shovel to go clear ice. I don't take a pitchfork because I get frustrated when,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:36:07):**  when it like doesn't sit on the tines right. And it just slips through. I feel like I can get a  lot more out in a hurry with a shovel than I can with a pitchfork. And I feel like I can get a lot  more done with a 12 or 16 pound sledgehammer than I can with little acts. Oh, I mean, we,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:36:24):**  we definitely had the sledgehammer though with us. It was sledgehammer, break it up as much as we  could then just get that pitchfork because the pitchfork that I have, I mean, it's,  it was one of the real wide ones with the thin tines. So at least that, that helped a lot,  
**[0:36:37-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:36:37):**  but then it started getting to a point where the cows, they need to drink out of the pond too.  While the pond is starting to get, it started getting thicker and thicker and thicker. And  there was one point my 1200 pound bulls were walking on top of the ice and I was like,  
**[0:36:52-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:36:52):**  no, no, no, no, no, no. That's my income. I got to put, I got to bring them back in the,  in the small pen and just do. And we ended up getting,  I can imagine the panic setting in you going out and you're really expensive seedstock bulls  
**[0:37:09-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:37:09):**  out there trying to ice skate, having fun. Yeah. Yeah. And I was surprised to see him  walking on the pond. And so I, cause I was going back to my house. So that way I could  warm up my feet. Cause I was not prepared for that. And so I went back to the house,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:37:25):**  got my parents. We went up there, brought them all in and we ended up just getting a water tank and  using the hot water out of the barn and just backing up there with our RTV and  filling up the tanks like that at that point. But we, we got really lucky because Texas was  
**[0:37:41-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:37:41):**  doing really bad with with our electrical grid. I think you probably heard about that.  And we're lucky because we're on a co-op. So we only lost power for one hour throughout the whole  thing. So we were really lucky on that and, but a lot of people around here were not lucky  
**[0:38:00-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:38:00):**  when it came to that. Yeah. If the grid goes down, I lose two water systems, which is going to be  four tanks. Is that pumped out of the ground? Yeah. Yeah. I pump almost everything out of,  out of wells in the ground with solar pumps. Just cause when, when dad was developing all the water  
**[0:38:23-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:38:23):**  systems out here and putting them in, you know, there's a little bit of cost share money  involved available. Well, a solar pump was, you know, even when they were like $20,000 for a  solar well and just enough panels to run the grid, they were able to do that. And so I was like,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:38:37):**  I want to pump that with solar well, and just enough panels to run it when they were $20,000.  That was still a lot cheaper than trying to run. Even like two power poles to get anywhere.  And there was, there was a couple of systems that dad set up that the power company was like,  
**[0:38:51-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:38:51):**  yeah, sure. We'll take the power over there. Here's your estimate, sir. It was like $150,000  to run, run a mile of power lines across pasture to get down. Nobody wanted maybe we could pump  with solar. So I have two big solar pump storage water systems. One of my pump out of a creek,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:39:13):**  the other one I pump out of a little pit pond that's basically a spring head. We pump like  10 to 12 gallons a minute out of it and it still flows 10 to 20 out the overflow. No  kidding. Yeah, it's a pretty impressive spring. Then the other one we have down on the creek,  
**[0:39:30-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:39:30):**  down on the water table that's on a creek. One of them pumps uphill like 120 feet, the other one  pumps uphill about 180 feet. Got 18,000 gallons of storage on what I call Bob. And that's the one  that only comes up about 125 feet. And then on the other one, we've got, it's probably about 18  
**[0:39:53-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:39:53):**  to 19,000 gallons of storage up there too as well. That's not even a third of the ranch.  Really? Yeah. And how big is y'all's ranch? About 7,000 acres. I own some of that and I lease some  of that from a family land partnership. I have another really interesting water system down south  
**[0:40:15-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:40:15):**  that I don't have storage on. So when it was put in, it was put in on a grid tied water pump.  And it's a super good well. They couldn't bail it at 25 gallons a minute, but we just put a 10  gallon a minute pump on it with a choke. Just so if we do have a leak, we don't have any extra ponds  
**[0:40:37-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:40:37):**  in the pasture, which happens every once in a while. When you put a water line in the ground  over 30 years ago, there's going to be glue joints that are going to start leaking every once in a  while. So we had to dig one up back in the spring and re-glue two joints. Anyway, so that water  
**[0:40:53-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:40:53):**  system, it's about two and a half miles of pipe. And it started with that grid tied pump. Well,  and there was another windmill down on the south end of the place. And sometime probably in early  2000s, dad found one of those 10,000 gallon tanks that I've since moved. And he put it down there by  
**[0:41:13-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:41:13):**  that windmill. So for a while the procedure was go down there four or five days before the cows are  going to be down there make sure the windmills turned on, fill up the storage tank, the storage  tank isn't filled up. Later, we installed a cross connect where we could cross connect it into a  
**[0:41:27-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:41:27):**  main water system and fill that tank from from that main water system. Okay, so that worked  pretty well. Then we had an 85 mile an hour straight line wind for about four hours. And that  windmill did not survive. Yeah, I went back out in the morning and the head and the wheel were all  
**[0:41:46-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:41:46):**  laying on the ground. Just kind of lucky they didn't end up in the tank. Yeah. Because because  all my tanks are fiberglass. I use 16 foot fiberglass tanks. Gotcha. So I just said, Okay,  this is no big deal. I we replumb the storage tank replumb the float valve toward work on the you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:42:06):**  know, where I could fill that storage tank up, keep it full and run on the float valve. That  worked pretty well for a couple years. And then I got the bright idea like, hey, why don't I just  go recaste that old windmill and throw a solar panel on it and another pump. So we did that. And  
**[0:42:23-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:42:23):**  now I've got that water system. So it's got the solar pump on a pressure switch. And the grid  tide pump is on a pressure switch. We reset that grid tide pressure switch really high. So it  doesn't kick on. It's like if that solar pump can meet all the demand that good type kick on.  
**[0:42:42-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:42:42):**  Gotcha. So cool. Yeah, that works pretty smooth. And the grid tide pump is the backup for when my  solar goes down or if it's if it's a couple of cloudy days. You know, kind of likewise, you  know, 18,000 gallons of water. Yeah, it's a lot of water. But you know, for 250 cows, that's like  
**[0:43:01-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:43:01):**  four days, maybe. Yeah. So I like to keep my storage tanks full case I have a problem  somewhere. I know I've got water to keep my stock tanks full. And that gives me a few days to fix a  problem or to figure out how I'm going to get my cows to water. Yeah, like hauling water to 200 or  
**[0:43:21-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:43:21):**  250 cows out here. That's, that's a feat. Good way to waste a lot of time and energy. Yeah, much.  I can imagine. It's like an art. Go ahead. Sorry.  I get the hauling water, you know, is a thing. If you've got 10 cows. Fine, whatever. I don't care.  
**[0:43:44-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:43:44):**  But if you're trying to haul water to 200 or 500 cows, yeah, maybe we need to ask a few questions.  Yeah, is I mean, because we're a small operation. So most of our pens have a pond. But we also have  the city water. We've always had it. And right now, because we have so many people moving in, it's  
**[0:44:03-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:44:03):**  starting to worry me about I don't I don't know how water rights and stuff would work because I  know there's a town near us that they started having water issues. And they were telling the  town like don't water your lawn and this and that. Well, when you have so many suburban development  
**[0:44:22-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:44:22):**  in the area, you know, we only have we have three lakes over here where we get all, pretty much all  the water comes from. Well, with if we have cities over here that are normally, you know, 5000  population, and in the next 15 years, they're saying we're going to have 30 to 50,000 populations  
**[0:44:39-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:44:39):**  in these cities. You know, water is going to, it's going to be pretty important and to be able to  water all my cows and our horses all the time. And we have a we have a way to be able to collect  water, we have a huge indoor arena. And we have this base that it I'd like to try and find a way  
**[0:44:59-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:44:59):**  to be able to make all the make all the culverts or make all the water go into storage tanks, at least  so we could collect off of these to be able to save water like that. And just do something  different up until we can at least sell the property. You know, and move somewhere bigger  
**[0:45:21-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:45:21):**  somewhere else where there's less people.  So you're talking about selling and moving. And so here's a couple things on my mind. You know,  our mutual friend Hobbs, fire and sell.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:45:32):**  Yeah, yeah.  When he was planning his move out of Sisters down to Lufkin, like he made a series of videos about  the area that he was going to look in and why. So for those kind of unfamiliar what I'm talking  
**[0:45:49-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:45:49):**  about, there's there's kind of like, there's an area where where Hobbs said, and I agree with him  almost 100%, that it doesn't snow too much in the winter that you should be able to graze your  around. It gets enough rain consistently not affected by you know, not horribly affected by  
**[0:46:09-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:46:09):**  seasonal droughts like I'm dealing with right now. And I've been dealing with for a couple of  years. And there's also population density. And the land is still semi affordable, to be able to  at least pay for it with cows or at least, you know, pay the interest on the note with cows. I  
**[0:46:29-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:46:29):**  don't think there's anything where you can go and buy dirt in this country and pay for it with cows  anymore. And that and that that also kind of leads into another point. So we talked about  Interstate 35 earlier. And Interstate 35 kind of more or less parallels the 100th meridian. Okay.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:46:48):**  And it kind of goes back to something John Wesley Powell said, probably back in the 20s or 30s, that  that 100th meridian is pretty much the dividing line of civilization. And it's really weird  because if you look at a map of where the people live in this country, 80% of them either live on  
**[0:47:05-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:47:05):**  the callous either live on the Pacific Coast, or east of the 100th meridian.  When I mean, down here, when once you go past Gainesville, that's it for population, then, you  know, it's going west. Yes, going west.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:47:23):**  That's the thing. North from Gainesville.  Oh, no, no, no, no. And all the way to then you're fine. But yeah, going west. I mean, it's just,  it's like your your background. That's what it starts to look like at past that point. And then  
**[0:47:36-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:47:36):**  once you start going east, you know, it's a lot more water, it's a lot more trees. And I mean,  it's, it's definitely different. We were kind of had a plan, if we could find a place in Oklahoma  where land is cheaper, and do like that, but not at least too far. We're kind of thinking of have a  
**[0:47:56-0:48:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:47:56):**  place where we could keep the cows and still keep our house, our ranch there to be able to develop  anything or keep certain animals there, the bulls there, that we're going to end up selling, just  keep the cows out at the other place, and try like that. But it's still, we're still waiting, you  
**[0:48:14-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:48:14):**  know, for that. Because when we sell, we have to sell a lot of it all at once, right? You know, we  can't and have to have something as a backup to go ahead and take the cows out there and kind of do  on.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:48:27):**  I think like, Eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Oklahoma, especially, I think would be a pretty  good spot.  It's pretty out there too.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:48:35):**  Or the western half of Arkansas, I think might be all right, too.  Yeah, that area there's, you know, there's always property available out there. And it's, it's,  it's good land. And it's not too many people, but it's, it's enough out there that there's also  
**[0:48:51-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:48:51):**  enough rainfall, typically, you can manage well.  If I moved 150 miles east, I could do everything I'm doing on less than half the land.  No kidding.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:04):**  Yeah.  Would that be in Missouri still, or is still in Kansas?  That'd be southeast Kansas, kind of over by like, Coffeyville area.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:15):**  Okay.  Coffeyville, Pittsburgh, you know, that kind of southeast Kansas where it's a little bit of  wooded, maybe kind of on the east edge of the Flint Hills before it gets taken over by trees.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:27):**  Okay, gotcha.  Gotcha.  We're actually heading over there tomorrow.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:32):**  And I get by the time this comes out, it'll be a couple weeks in the past.  I'm headed to Fuller, Gail Fuller's field day, field school, gonna go camp in my friend Gail  Fuller's yard and hang out with like minded human soil health nuts that are trying to rebuild  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:48):**  local food systems.  I'm looking forward to that.  Cool.  
**[0:49:51-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:49:51):**  That'll be fun.  And if you're wondering where you can find some of these events at, there's Kansas Soil Health  Alliance has an events calendar that's at kssoilhealth.org forward slash events.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:06):**  And I'll try to make sure I have a link for that and a show notes and that should have a lot of,  you know, soil health and regenerative events coming up.  If you can send that to me, I guess later in the WhatsApp.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:19):**  Yeah, yeah.  For sure.  That was kind of an unplanned little ad read promo thing.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:24):**  No, that's fine.  For at least for the listeners.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:28):**  And you know, for the listeners that are interested, I've just admitted to being part of the team at  Soil Health U.  I probably should have the dates in front of it.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:39):**  It should be like third week of January.  Tony's event center, Salina, Kansas.  We'll have some, I'll be getting some details about that and hopefully a discount code for all of  
**[0:50:52-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:50:52):**  all of y'all to be able to use to get discounted admission to Soil Health U.  So I get that it's probably a little far out of your out of your travel zone, but I like to travel.  I like I mean, I've traveled a lot by myself to ranches up in Illinois, North Dakota, Montana.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:51:12):**  I love to travel, love to see cattle, love to.  I think it's really important to get off the ranch and go get exposed to new ideas and, and  guys, just go get training.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:51:24):**  I mean, it's a conversation that's that's been started on a, on a social media platform.  How do you feel about that?  Oh, uh, from that video, the other day of like all the training, the CEs, stuff like that.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:51:35):**  I think it's important.  I think everybody needs to do it.  Cause then if you, if you just get stuck in your old ways all the time, you don't, you can't better  
**[0:51:43-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:51:43):**  yourself, you can't grow as like my dad always taught me.  Whenever you, if you have a question about something, ask that question to every producer.  When you go to all the ranches, doesn't matter where they are, you can't do it.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:51:56):**  Every producer, when you go to all the ranches, doesn't matter where they are in the country.  If they're in Brazil, if they're here, ask the same questions of the way they do it.  And gradually, you know, you'll be able to at least learn what's going to work best for you.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:09):**  And you'll also come up with your own way, what works best for you.  And also just what's the correct way.  What's the average way somebody does something.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:21):**  So like, if I asked this producer, what mineral program is yours?  What vaccination program do you have mineral program for you?  You know, how do you feed hay?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:30):**  How do you raise a bowl like this?  So any way to learn something.  And I think at least on Tik TOK, it helps a lot on there because you can learn from a lot of different producers  
**[0:52:40-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:40):**  also whenever they're get on their soap boxes about that stuff.  Oh yeah.  There's some people that have some pretty, uh, pretty wild soap boxes.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:50):**  They want to get on a rant about them.  Yeah.  We all do on there.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:52:55):**  You know, it gets, it gets to the best of us sometimes, but I think it's, it's a really important platform.  At least it's bringing, bringing a lot of good conversations.  Yeah.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:53:07):**  Hey, we've got a break here, so I'm going to do an ad read and punch a button.  So we'll, uh, we'll be right back.  Introducing C90 Ocean Minerals.

**[0:54:22-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:54:22):**  And we're back.  So back to your trip to Brazil, you mentioned regenerative grazing.  So that can be kind of a conscientious term sometimes.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:54:37):**  So how do you define regenerative ag or regenerative grazing?  So that's when we're talking in Portuguese and English, that's just kind of the way that they try to describe it.  How do you describe it at least?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:54:57):**  Because I don't think I have a good definition or understanding completely.  So I guess we can kind of talk about it in broad strokes.  There's the traditional or there's the production slash commodity type system, which my friend Michael Thompson would say is like farming in a flower pot.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:55:20):**  It's you're treating your soil like it's basically just aggregate to grow plants in.  And then as you transition to the sustainable side, people are more thinking about, OK, is this really going to be here for my kids if I keep doing this?  And if people start down that path, they realize that almost 99% of things they're doing are destructive to the earth, not 99%.  
**[0:55:46-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:55:46):**  A lot of the things they're doing is destructive to some part of the ecosystem.  And they get a little bit farther down that path and to get into regenerative.  And the production commodity guys, they get up in the morning and they'll load up a sprayer and they're going to go kill something or they're going to go hook onto the disk or the plow.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:56:06):**  And they're going to go out and plow it up and kill something.  OK. The regenerative guys, we like to wake up in the morning and go out and find new life, find some new weed we haven't seen before, find a grass we haven't seen before, see a plant we haven't seen before.  Get those bonus baby calves that we weren't expecting out of our big giant horned calves that are big giant horned cows that won't fit down the chute to get preg checked.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:56:29):**  Yeah, gotcha.  That's the biggest difference.  You know, and it's a mindset, too, I think.  
**[0:56:39-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:56:39):**  You know, if a producer is going to be regenerative, I find that almost all of them are asking questions about their operations, other folks' operations, what they can do better.  And not just that, they understand that they don't know everything, that this business is always evolving, that the land is always evolving.  We're learning new things and we have to spread those ideas.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:57:05):**  And those ideas get spread at a lot of conferences, seminars, webinars.  Well, probably on some podcast.  I don't know what we're doing here, but, you know, there's probably some other podcasts out there that have useful information.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:57:17):**  Yeah, so the way it sounds to me is working with nature and not against it.  Nature plus one.  Nature plus one.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:57:28):**  Nature with gentle guiding nudges.  Let the cows express themselves, make sure they, you know, when I'm rotating my cows, you know, I got to move them into a pasture where they know they've got forage.  And there's, Kevin, it's really weird that, you know, I'll move out of a pasture with waist deep grass.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:57:50):**  And people are like, you got plenty of grass here, why are you moving out of this?  Because I've been in here 11 days and yeah, there's waist deep grass, but a lot of it was over my head when I moved in here.  Yeah, gotcha.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:58:04):**  They might've already taken half out of it and I still have, you know, a thousand, 12, 1500 pounds per acre of forage in a pasture.  I can't take that.  I mean, if we keep taking that over after we've already taken, you know, the first half of forage, we stay in there, we're likely to over graze our pastures.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:58:22):**  Yeah.  You know, and it's funny, our friends at Noble, they're starting to make some great content, you know, to talk about what overstocking and overgrazing really means.  It's possible to be under stocked on a ranch that's overgrazed.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:58:39):**  Gotcha.  Yeah.  So like with my operation right now, I, I'm, we've always kind of had the mindset of with as small of an operation as we have, we need to have the maximum output that we can with the cows.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:58:52):**  So we need to be able to have as many cows as we can on there.  Yeah.  And that means feeding hay.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:58:57):**  That means feeding grain.  Well, then look what happens whenever all the inputs are super expensive.  Well, as taking away from the profit that I need to make in the long run that I normally make.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:59:07):**  So, and right now, you know, because we also still have the mindset of maybe transitioning to another operation at some point.  So I don't want to get rid of, because also do seed stock, you know, the purebred register.  So I don't want to get rid of bad genetics or certain cows that I can still try and retain some daughters out of.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:59:30):**  And so that might perform better on another ranch.  Is that what you're saying?  Well, that I need to cut down on cows.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:59:40):**  Let's say like, I I'm a little overstocked right now for my operation, but right now there's some cows that I'm, I'm not ready to get rid of, you know, cause I know I, I really want to  want a daughter out of her.  She can still produce a good bull for me.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=0:59:55):**  So right now I have maybe, I feel that that's why I have this year.  I have.  So I completely called my open cows, my bad foot cows, because even my bad foot cows, they could raise a good calf.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:00:09):**  So I put embryos in them.  Well, I got them bred to a bull and took them to the sale barn and got rid of them.  And so now I maybe have eight cows that are going to calf now.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:00:20):**  They're good cows.  I don't think they belong at this to go to the sale barn.  I think I can sell them to somebody who's had to sell out a bunch of cows.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:00:29):**  Now that we have a lot more rain and a lot more hay and stuff, I'm hoping that there's going to be more of a market coming up soon that maybe people will be wanting to buy some more good cows.  And then once I can cut down on them, then I think I'll be at kind of a number right now that I'll be able to manage my pastures a little bit better.  Cause I have cows in every pasture.  
**[1:00:50-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:00:50):**  And that's tough to rotate cows in less than 20 acre pasture, trying to rotate them and still maintain the grass and not use as much hay.  The things separate that you want to keep separate.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:01:07):**  Yeah.  Cause I can't, you know, cause some, cause I'll still use a bull and I can't use, you know, I can't separate out, uh, certain cows from certain group because they're related to that bull.  And so I I'm small group of cows here, small group of cows here, small group of cows here, and just trying to work around that right now.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:01:29):**  It's, it's a work in progress, but it's still going.  I, I understand.  And I, everybody has to make, you make, you have to make sacrifices.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:01:42):**  You have to make sacrifices and I think one thing that's important to understand about regenerative ag, it's not a destination.  It's a journey and you start where you are.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:01:57):**  Um, I haven't really, I haven't ever told this, this little anecdote on, on a podcast or on social media.  So several years ago, I think it was, uh, I think it was 2021, I was at soil health, you, they had me up there to speak and I had, or maybe it was 21.  I got to share, not the stage, Ray Archuleta was also there speaking and a lot of listeners know who Ray Archuleta is.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:02:26):**  Are you familiar with Ray?  I, it may, if I saw the name.  He's a, he's a former NRCS employee that basically for the last, since he retired, I don't know, eight, 10 years ago, he's basically been traveling around the country saying, Hey, everything I told you to do for 30 years at NRCS was wrong.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:02:43):**  This is what you need to do now.  Um, huge advocate for regenerative agriculture and gotcha.  Gotcha.  
**[1:02:49-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:02:49):**  He loves the, like, he loves to start off a keynote by making everybody get up and do jumping jacks or some shit.  But I, one of the things they do at still health you that's really cool is they have a speaker's room.  So you know, all the speakers and presenters, we can go hide and not get, you know, get a break from getting cornered in the hallways, which I don't mind, but there's a point where I'm just like, I'm done with people.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:03:11):**  I need a break for a minute.  I have that thing to go hide.  So, you know, over the course of two days of being there, I got to know Ray a little bit.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:03:18):**  And, and at the time we were kind of referring to, to soil health as a bus, like, all right, so it's, I was on the bus.  This guy's on the soil health bus.  And a few of us, we kind of expanded that to talking about, well, this guy just got his ticket, but he's not sure if he wants to get on.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:03:34):**  And then we started wondering like, well, who's driving the bus.  And that kind of led to a, to an email chain with Gabe Brown and Ray Archuleta.  And I said, well, Gabe's driving the bus.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:03:44):**  And Ray's reading the map and I'm trying to make the map in crayon.  I'm trying to write the map in crayon as fast as I can to get it to Ray to read to Gabe to drive the boat.  But maybe not everybody will get that one.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:03:57):**  So everything, everything, not in one herd.  I get that.  I get you have to make some sacrifices.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:04:07):**  And like I said, you start where you are.  You're not going to get the same thing.  I get you have to make some sacrifices and like I said, you start where you are.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:04:14):**  And part of it is, is understanding that you're not doing everything as good as you could be.  Versus, you know, some of the conventional guys that, you know, went to college 20 years ago, maybe have a piece of paper on their wall that says ag management and they've never gotten, gone and got any other education or.  You know, it, it always kind of strikes me when somebody says, I'm just here for the CE or I have to go to this much a year.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:04:42):**  Like have to know you should want to.  Yeah.  I mean, if you didn't have to go, if you didn't have to go to maintain that certification, how many hours would you go to?  
**[1:04:54-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:04:54):**  Yeah.  That's kind of what I'd like to know and probably never know that number.  That's okay.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:07):**  And you know, hopefully this next year I'm going to be, be able to go to more, try to go to as much as I can, as long as my parents are around and you know, somebody's watching doesn't need help or something.  But.  There's a game coming up in November called regenerate in Denver.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:25):**  In Denver?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:27):**  Early bird tickets are still on sale, I think for another few days.  But by the time this comes out, you're going to have to pay full price.  But yeah, regenerate 22 in Denver.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:36):**  That's a covera coalition puts that on.  I've been twice Albuquerque both times and it was awesome.  Really?  
**[1:05:46-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:46):**  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:05:47-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:05:47):**  That's, that's, that's, that's a good thing.  Yeah.  That's if you want to find, if you want to go hang out with a bunch of other soil health nerds and people that are in regenerative ag, regenerates, regenerate would be a good one.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:06:00):**  Probably be five or 600 people.  Really?  Yeah.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:06:05):**  That ranch that I went to in Brazil, the, that real big one, they're trying to, it's, it's like you said, it's like a journey.  They're not all the way there yet, but they're trying to transition their operation to a more regenerative means instead of just depending on buying fertilizer all the time and having to use that and then having to use pesticides and herbicides and all the time.  Just being able to do in a way that they can maintain it all with, with as minimal amount of extra input as they can.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:06:41):**  Can you talk about that a little bit, what that kind of looked like or?  Yeah.  So in Brazil, they have a grass called brachiotia grass.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:06:54):**  It's kind of like a crab grass and both the ranches that I went to, what they'll over seed, the, their corn crop with the brachiotia, and then they'll get all their corn and then the brachiotia.  I mean, it's, it'll be huge, tall.  So then they'll turn out all the cattle on that and rotate them.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:07:14):**  And at that place, like I said, they have, you know, 20 to 25, excuse me, 20 to 25,000 head.  And they have 15 Cowboys to handle them all.  And so they'll just use electric fences, rotate them around.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:07:28):**  Don't let it get, you know, don't let them hit it too hard.  Keep going and keep going.  And often they'd be moving them like in a situation like that.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:07:38):**  I'd have to go back in, in, cause I, I recorded pretty much all of our conversations.  So, uh, as, as I go on and start going through those videos, I'll, I'll send them to you also.  So you can, you won't know what they say, but, and, uh,  
**[1:07:54-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:07:54):**  Portuguese, but I can at least look at pretty pictures.  And yeah.  And another thing that they're doing is, um, over seeding cert.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:08:03):**  Over seeding cert, I don't remember exactly when they do it, but they oversee it with, uh, with mixes.  So they'll, and I'll send you the pictures after they have like big turnips.  I guess they'd be like a turnip and the root would get huge and they'd have that they'd have, um,  
**[1:08:22-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:08:22):**  uh, a bunch of legumes that they plant.  And so that way they could, uh, might have to help me with the wording, but to, um,  nitrogen fixation in the ground, because they were telling me the problem is, is that when  
**[1:08:39-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:08:39):**  all the nutrients that are really way down below that the grass on top, isn't going to get,  you need to bring them up, bring them up.  And so that's what they want to do is, uh, deep rooted plant plants do that.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:08:55):**  And they'll still use glysophate.  I don't know.  I don't remember when it is that they do it because I think they, cause they can't do  
**[1:09:02-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:09:02):**  the brachiotia grass with their sorghum because it'll, it can get taller than the sorghum.  Okay.  At times.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:09:10):**  So it, that will affect the crop.  So they'll just do it with, uh, with the corn.  So they mainly do corn at least on their, on that operation.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:09:22):**  And like they're 10, they have a 10,000 head feedlot and that feedlot has a pond in the  very back where all the, the poop and the wastewater goes to, well, all of the water  and waste from that pond is that's all the fertilizer they use for 12,000 acres of sorghum.  
**[1:09:42-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:09:42):**  If they're grazing it at higher densities and moving frequently, there's also a very  large value of fertility per acre that those cattle are dropping at ultra high density.  And, and that fertilizer coming out of the back of a cow is bioavailable to all your  
**[1:10:06-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:06):**  soil life.  Yeah.  And when, when you have a feedlot type situation where your manure and your urine goes to a  
**[1:10:14-1:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:14):**  lagoon for a period of time before it's, it's transported back out and sprayed back out  and sprayed back out in a pasture, there's different decomposition processes that start.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:25):**  So you don't want a cow pat just lands in the pasture.  That's going to be, that's going to be, um, aerobic decomposition, decomposition with  air and, you know, our microbiome, uh, the microbes and the dung beetles, you know, they're  
**[1:10:38-1:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:38):**  going to get in there and they're going to make tunnels in it, let air get in there,  dry it out and whatever.  But when it's in a liquid form and it stays in a liquid form and gets mixed with urine,  
**[1:10:48-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:48):**  you know, then you're getting into some anaerobic decomposition products, which is where, which  can lead to some toxic gases and some, and some not so great decomposition byproducts.  Okay.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:10:59):**  Gotcha.  Cause of the urine in it as well.  And, you know, while I'm talking about it and like this isn't on you or anything, but  
**[1:11:08-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:11:08):**  just in general.  So, you know, we talk about feedlots and feedlot waste management and how, with all the antibiotics  that we use in this country, like 80, some almost 80% of antibiotics by weight in this  
**[1:11:29-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:11:29):**  country are fed the livestock in a confined feeding operation.  And it's a, it's a very similar percentage for sodium bicarbonate.  Mm-hmm.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:11:38):**  We feed so many tons of sodium bicarbonate to cattle.  Like, okay, well, why do we do that?  Well, we have to feed them sodium bicarbonate to prevent acid forming in the rumen.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:11:47):**  Why do they have so much acid in the rumen?  Because they eat a lot of grain.  Yeah.  
**[1:11:52-1:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:11:52):**  You know?  So it's like, yeah.  Anyway, it's there, there's a better, it's like, we're pushing the cattle too much to  
**[1:12:04-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:12:04):**  do something that they're not made to do.  It seems like sometimes we, you know, we've been able to make the cow more efficient.  You know, we talk about the size of the cow to produce more beef with less head of cattle  
**[1:12:18-1:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:12:18):**  and stuff, but today it's like, well, at what cost?  More pounds per animal.  Is that good for the producer or is that good for the packer?  
**[1:12:27-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:12:27):**  Well, exactly.  So in Brazil, the price of cattle in Brazil is the same here.  JBS controls the entire market there in Brazil also.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:12:36):**  They control the entire market here too.  Yeah.  And so a lot of times I'll see people, they get all huffy and puffy about Brazil.  
**[1:12:44-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:12:44):**  It's like, well, well, the Brazilian cattle is probably just Amazon rainforest cattle.  And it's, it's really not because JBS also wants to have, they, you know, they don't  want a crap product at the end of the day.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:01):**  That's too, that's why they're also, they don't want negative image either.  Yeah, exactly.  So they're going to try and do what they can to save themselves, you know, over everyone  
**[1:13:11-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:11):**  else.  And at the same time, I saw USDA report that, you know, Mexico and Canada, I, if I remember  I, Mexico, Canada, and Australia, we import more beef from them than we do Brazil.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:28):**  Not like as a whole, but Canada, I'll send you the link after, but Canada and Australia,  I believe we import more beef from them than we do from Brazil.  And I see a lot, at least on social media, it's probably just a few loud mouths about  
**[1:13:45-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:45):**  it.  I'm kind of a loud mouth against Brazilian imports.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:49):**  I love to say that the American beef consumer wouldn't have to get upset about the rainforest  being destroyed.  Animal agriculture if we quit importing beef from Brazil.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:13:58):**  Yeah.  And one thing I noticed about like the American beef industry is they try to have the best  absolute product that we can produce.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:14:09):**  You know, it has to have a lot of marbling.  It has to taste good.  It has to, they try to make it too perfect of a product.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:14:20):**  And to me in the long run, I feel like we're making a commodity that is, how do I put it?  Only for those at some point who can afford it because beef is so expensive, at least  if you catch one.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:14:37):**  I don't know if you're.  Yeah, I mean, it's expensive, but at the same time, I still think it's too cheap.  A lot of it's too cheap.  
**[1:14:47-1:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:14:47):**  Too cheap.  Yeah, well, if we're going to talk about commodity beef, you know, and feedlots and the environmental  cost of feedlots and the crop agriculture to support that.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:15:06):**  We also have to talk about exploited labor in packing plants.  Yeah.  You know, we could talk about, you know, what kind of people work in the packing plants,  
**[1:15:19-1:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:15:19):**  what the working conditions are like, what they get paid, what the living conditions  are like in Southwest Kansas and Texas and Oklahoma panhandles where a lot of packing  and feeding is concentrated.  
**[1:15:28-1:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:15:28):**  Because they have like one person for every single step along the way practically.  Yeah.  And you know, Mike Calacrado makes some really great arguments about the perception of  
**[1:15:42-1:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:15:42):**  efficiency of scale in those big plants.  And you know, he's got some, you know, he's got some good solid numbers to back up what  he says.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:15:52):**  But you know, I like, you know, I'd like to pick on JBS.  So don't take it personally that you're.  No, no, it's fine.  
**[1:16:02-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:16:02):**  I mean, it's, I don't care if it's two billionaire brothers or whatever it is.  You know, they hire migrants, low skills, immigrant workers to come in, in these horrible  working conditions because these immigrants want the opportunities afforded in America.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:16:24):**  And they've gotten away with it for a long time by being able to use exploited labor  that's basically underpaid.  And the horrible, horrible thing about that is, and I'll pick on JBS again.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:16:38):**  And you know, we can pick on Marfrig, we can pick on Smithfield because those are three  of the biggest protein companies in the entire world.  And they're taking advantage of exploited labor to sell us overpriced meat.  
**[1:16:52-1:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:16:52):**  Yeah.  And then turn around and say grass fed beef is too expensive.  And I think that a lot of these big companies hide their environmental and social costs  
**[1:17:08-1:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:17:08):**  with efficiencies of, with so-called efficiencies of scale.  Yeah.  And they, you know, it's, they get told a lot, well, it's the best protein and we,  
**[1:17:19-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:17:19):**  you know, it's because of protein, we need the protein and stuff.  Well, you know, at what cost?  I see a lot, I'd like to look well more in, or, you know, dive more into the numbers on  
**[1:17:31-1:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:17:31):**  it, but I always see a backup.  Well, most of the feed that we feed cattle is, what is it, byproducts of what we make  for corn and stuff.  
**[1:17:41-1:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:17:41):**  Well, I see a lot of cattle that, you know, operations are making their own corn silage  that's there on the, there on the property or other places that, you know, do the same.  So how much is it actually that it's just byproducts?  
**[1:18:00-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:00):**  And.  Yeah, it's, it's real easy to grow cows when you have a feedlot next door to an ethanol  plant.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:09):**  Yeah.  I mean, let's, let's be real because that ethanol plant is going to have tons of grain  to deal with every day.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:17):**  And if you just say, Hey, I'll take that off your hands for $20 a ton.  Yeah.  You can feed that to cows and make a shitload of money, but somebody's getting exploited  
**[1:18:28-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:28):**  along the way.  And it's the American taxpayer.  Yep.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:31):**  Because they're buying your feed stuff to feed your cows.  So your cost of production is super low.  You capture all the premiums you want at the sale barn.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:41):**  Think you're getting a good deal while you're cutting every other honest cattleman's throat.  JBS or Tyson or Cargill get the ultra premium on your carcass.  Get the, get, get the meat, the gravy and the cherry and give you back 10 cents and  
**[1:18:56-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:18:56):**  make you think you did them a favor.  Yeah, exactly.  Cause that's just the way that the market's been built around.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:19:02):**  So anybody who's been in it, they don't think that there's, there's better ways to  be able to make your, your money back, or at least not, you know, get the, the, the  you know, giving it to these, these corporations and these people who control it all.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:19:20):**  And there's, I've always thought, and this is, this is some of the libertarian to me.  If I can't run my business and be profitable without government subsidies, I shouldn't  be in business.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:19:33):**  Yeah.  And that, well, that's what our, our friend in Brazil was, was telling me that he thinks  in the U S you know, we have just as much capability to be able to do like what they  
**[1:19:44-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:19:44):**  do down there.  You know, I mean, even though they're growing season is a little bit different and stuff,  but he thinks that they're able to do it here.  
**[1:19:51-1:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:19:51):**  It just, the subsidies are what's preventing it pretty much.  And I'm not, I'm not very knowledgeable on all that.  I'm trying to learn right now as much as I can on that.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:04):**  But it's.  It's the broad strokes of it is when you go to say farm credit or the bank to get a  loan, they're not going to tell you what you can and can't grow.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:15):**  They're not going to tell you how to grow it.  They're not going to tell you what kind of cows to have.  They're just going to make sure that all your numbers line up.  
**[1:20:22-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:22):**  And if you're planting a crop, they need to have security on that crop.  What's the security on that crop insurance.  So if you go borrow a hundred thousand dollars, cause you want to grow a crop of something  
**[1:20:33-1:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:33):**  because you need that money to pay your tractor, your fuel, your, you know, your inputs, your  implement and your land rent.  The bank's going to want to say, okay, we need to make sure we get our money back.  
**[1:20:43-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:43):**  So go put insurance on that crop.  So then you take your paperwork and you go to the NRC or go to the farm service agency.  And what crops can I plant that I can get insurance for here?  
**[1:20:55-1:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:20:55):**  And it's usually a very, very narrow range of commodity crops that you can plant.  And even if they do ensure crops that you would like to grow, there may not be a co-op  market for them.  
**[1:21:10-1:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:10):**  So that's, there's, you know, there's a lot of farmers that look, let's face it.  I don't want to deal with customers anymore than I have to.  I don't want to deal with the public anymore than I have to.  
**[1:21:19-1:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:19):**  Ideal world.  I could just sit out on my ranch and grow cows and people would come, they would come  out, hand me money and I would give them beef and no words would have to be exchanged and  
**[1:21:30-1:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:30):**  they would leave.  Okay.  Like that would be a perfect world for me.  
**[1:21:34-1:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:34):**  We don't live there.  We have to, you know, we can't as producers, as livestock producers or crop producers,  we can't be content to just sell, sell in bulk to the easiest middleman.  
**[1:21:48-1:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:48):**  Yeah.  Like here there's, yeah, there's basically four crops that are grown in this area.  And I think there's six or seven that crop insurance would cover.  
**[1:21:57-1:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:21:57):**  But for those three or four that crop insurance will cover, if you wanted to grow it, you  got to have somewhere to sell it.  Gotcha.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:05):**  You already got to have the guy that's going to buy it lined up.  And if you're, if your local co-op won't buy it, you need on-farm storage to store it until  you can find a buyer until the buyer that you have arranged can come pick it up.  
**[1:22:18-1:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:18):**  So it starts to become a problem.  And one of the, you know, one of the solutions is, and I just throw this out there cause  I'm thinking about it.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:26):**  Like, so say you're a big corner soybean farmer listening to this and saying, Hey dude,  you're full of shit.  There's no way I can sell anything else.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:34):**  My friend, Russell Hidrick, who I did a previous episode with, he put a grain mill in a 20  foot cargo trailer with a bagging unit.  Really?  
**[1:22:47-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:47):**  Yeah.  So somebody that's growing a whole bunch of corn, you know what, take five acres and grow  a different variety or grow, you know, some barley or some heritage wheat or something  
**[1:22:56-1:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:22:56):**  different that might have a hundred X profit margin, but you won't, you wouldn't be able  to get rid of a whole circle of it.  But if you grow a couple, you know, a couple acres and have it milled into flour and put  
**[1:23:09-1:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:23:09):**  your farm label on it, how many of your neighbors would love to bake bread with wheat flour  from down the road?  I, I, I would.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:23:17):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sure would.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:23:20):**  And so like right now, like I said before, we have so many people moving in around here.  I feel like there is a market, at least for me, that, that I can tap into when it comes  to like producing beef.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:23:33):**  So I personally, I'm, I'm wanting to, from this crop I have right now, I'm wanting to  see if I can raise some steers that I can, you know, sell my own beef.  And I, I think that, you know, that's just something, a lot of us, if we're going to  
**[1:23:49-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:23:49):**  want to really stay in this and still be in, have our farms and ranches, especially on  a small scale, like I do, I think that's just something we're going to have to start  looking into to, to start being more, for a local production.  
**[1:24:06-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:24:06):**  It doesn't, you don't have to sell very much meat direct to consumer.  You don't have to sell very many halves or wholes before that starts to make a big  difference on your bottom line versus just the commodity market.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:24:19):**  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm, that's something I'm trying to dabble with now and just try, I'm  trying to move my, the operation in, in a different approach instead of just, I raise  
**[1:24:32-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:24:32):**  seed stock bulls, I sell the bulls to people who need them and that's it.  You know, if I got females to sell, that's it.  And just trying to make more out of, out of the land that we have, at least while we  
**[1:24:43-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:24:43):**  still have it, you know, and I'm going to try, I'm trying to implement as much  regenerative means as I can.  Like you said, it's a journey.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:24:56):**  It's not like it's a, you know, I still have my market with what I do, but in the  meantime, I want to try and, you know, steer it in a different direction.  Also, what do you think the most first step on your, on that regenerative journey is  
**[1:25:12-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:25:12):**  going to be, or what do you think your next step would be?  One cut down on a few more cows.  So that way I can, I think I can, uh, just handle what I have better.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:25:27):**  I think if I was able to cut down a few more cows, I could keep more together in a,  in a pasture.  I can leave other fields to grow back a lot more easily instead of having, you know,  
**[1:25:40-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:25:40):**  two, three pins of, uh, of electric fence in between them and stuff in, you know, 20  acre paddocks.  And something that I learned, I I'm dabbling with this, so I haven't even started, but  
**[1:25:56-1:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:25:56):**  I we'll, we'll see how it goes.  So with our horses, we have a lot of shavings, right?  And we have a big old shavings pile that where we've been, what kind of pine shavings for  
**[1:26:09-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:09):**  the horses in there.  Yes.  Yes.  
**[1:26:13-1:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:13):**  And so we have a big pile that's just turned into compost pretty much at this point.  It's real old.  So in Brazil at our friend's operation, they're doing a Mike microbial fermentation process  
**[1:26:26-1:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:26):**  where they have a huge water tank and they'll have a barrel in the middle.  And what they do is they go out in the woods and they collect all the dead leaves, all  the organic matter on the bottom, the top soil they'll take and they'll go and they'll  
**[1:26:40-1:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:40):**  put it in this barrel and they'll fill it with water and molasses as, uh, I forget what  the term is.  Probably some kind of like accelerant.  
**[1:26:51-1:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:51):**  Yeah.  For the bacteria.  And then they'll put a water aerators in there for 24 hours.  
**[1:26:58-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:26:58):**  And then they'll take all that and put it in there and they'll spray it on their compost.  Right.  And then from the, I'm still getting all the data on the compost.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:06):**  Yes.  Okay.  On their compost.  
**[1:27:09-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:09):**  And then the compost, they go and spread out on the pasture as fertilizer.  Okay.  And so just, I thought you were going to tell me that they like, they were making compost  
**[1:27:20-1:27:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:20):**  tea and liquid extract.  I mean, it's, it's, I guess it's kind of like that, but yeah, that's, that's what  I guess it's kind of like that, but yeah, they, they, they have their, their compost  
**[1:27:31-1:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:31):**  areas and, uh, they have this big, uh, it goes on their three-point and it's just a  big turner and it turns it all up pretty much the compost.  And then they put it on their spreader, put it out on the pasture.  
**[1:27:44-1:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:44):**  So I'm going to start trying to implement that.  I've got my pile going right now and I'm going to be going in the woods all around and  just collecting as much as I can.  
**[1:27:54-1:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:27:54):**  And, uh, I got a lot of limbs.  I use a wood chipper to, you know, throw in on there too, and all kinds of stuff.  Even there, all the cattle that die, they have a compost area where they put all the  
**[1:28:06-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:06):**  bodies of the dead cattle in there and they use that after a while.  What's biomass.  Yeah, it's biomass.  
**[1:28:12-1:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:12):**  So do you already have a wood chipper?  No.  Okay.  
**[1:28:17-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:17):**  There's a lot of places that ran them out around here, but I was just wondering like,  if you had one, cause you know, when the revolution comes, that'd be a great place to  stick a bunch of pedophiles.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:25):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  
**[1:28:27-1:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:27):**  We got enough place to hide it around here.  Oh man.  I haven't hardly asked you anything on this stupid list yet.  
**[1:28:37-1:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:37):**  Oh, geez.  Yeah, I know.  Right.  
**[1:28:39-1:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:39):**  We might have to come back and do this again.  That's fine with me.  I enjoy this.  
**[1:28:43-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:43):**  This is.  So while we're, while we're here, we're talking about the farm and, and possibly do a  sport regenerative practices.  
**[1:28:50-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:50):**  You mentioned that you have quote dirty soil.  Yeah, I did mention what that means.  So I call it dirty soil.  
**[1:28:58-1:29:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:28:58):**  I don't know if that's the best term to say this area has been cattle ranch for well  over a hundred years now.  And, but I see, like, I don't, I don't know what it's been here.  
**[1:29:15-1:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:29:15):**  Cause I looked at a picture from the fifties and I mean, it was just pasture land.  Well, now it's the lake that got, you know, they made a reservoir right next to me.  And I just, I have no idea what's what kind of cattle have been here.  
**[1:29:33-1:29:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:29:33):**  And when I raised Brahmas, my Brahma's never got sick.  But as soon as I started raising the Angus, those calves would get sick really bad.  They would get scours of fever and I would just have to start treating them all the time  
**[1:29:48-1:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:29:48):**  with, you know, Zach, Tran, Primo and just have to treat them all the time.  And to me, I think it just has something to do with the soil.  It's something in the ground that I guess the Angus are just more susceptible to than  
**[1:30:04-1:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:30:04):**  what the Brahmas were.  And now we have to, now we give vaccination and we hardly have an issue with it.  But that's what I, when I say dirty soil, that's what I kind of, as I get older, I  
**[1:30:18-1:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:30:18):**  have no idea what it all was around here back in the day.  Yeah, I mean, I just I kind of wanted to get an idea of what you're meaning, because,  you know, that could mean, I mean, a lot of different stuff.  
**[1:30:31-1:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:30:31):**  I mean, could mean, you know, everything from heavy metal or saltwater contamination to,  you know, residual herbicide or insecticide load.  So, I mean, we have a lot of oil tanks out here also.  
**[1:30:43-1:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:30:43):**  And just behind me, just south of me right here, we have a hayfield that we bought half  of the hayfield and our friend bought the other half.  Well, the other half that we didn't want that half, really, because it was the soil was  
**[1:30:59-1:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:30:59):**  completely saturated with oil because of that tank.  And I mean, it's still saturated.  It's it's bad.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:31:07):**  There's that.  And oh, also, all the old farmers around here, you know, who knows how many pesticides and  herbicides they were using all the time, all the time in the soil, because if you go out  
**[1:31:20-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:31:20):**  in the woods here, there's old sheds everywhere out in the woods around here.  There's an old shed here on our property right here next to my house.  There is a really old dump pile that there's still just pieces of tin you can find all  
**[1:31:35-1:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:31:35):**  over of oil cans even.  You know, so I, you know, I have no idea what exactly everything is.  It's all new growth, pretty much all the trees here.  
**[1:31:45-1:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:31:45):**  Just they're not old.  They're not.  Well, yeah, if there were trees here in the 1850s, they wouldn't our ancestors wouldn't  
**[1:31:52-1:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:31:52):**  have had to burn buffalo chips for cooking fuel.  Exactly.  And I mean, it's because we've also had a lot of cattle trails that pass in this journal  
**[1:32:06-1:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:32:06):**  area also.  So, you know, it's always been a real hustle bustle kind of area for the last couple hundred  years.  
**[1:32:17-1:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:32:17):**  So I got to ask, have you done any soil testing to see if there is a lot of residual herbicide  pesticide load in the soil?  So not soil tests like that.  
**[1:32:26-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:32:26):**  I mean, I'll do a yearly soil analysis, at least just to get an idea of what we need  for fertilizer, for lime, like that.  And not that I've seen anything on residual effects.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:32:40):**  Is there a test that you can do like that?  Well, I'm not sure what test you're using, but I like to, I'm familiar with basically  two soil tests.  
**[1:32:53-1:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:32:53):**  Okay.  One of them is the Haney test.  And the reason I think Haney test is good and not that I'm a testing expert, but the  
**[1:33:05-1:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:05):**  way I understand it, almost every other soil test or soil test uses like some kind of acid  to titrate the material.  So then they can break it down and see what's in there.  
**[1:33:19-1:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:19):**  Yeah.  It doesn't rain hydrochloric acid on my ranch.  I've never seen it rain hydrochloric acid on my ranch.  
**[1:33:26-1:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:26):**  It rains water.  Yeah.  So the Haney test uses water and it'll tell you, and Haney can tell you what's in your,  
**[1:33:38-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:38):**  I don't want to say something wrong.  The Haney test is what I would recommend.  That should give you an idea of what your nutrient load is.  
**[1:33:47-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:47):**  And then the PLFA, phosphoric.  Yeah.  I'm not going to get that one right.  
**[1:33:53-1:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:33:53):**  PLFA.  And Ward Laboratories can do those.  Regen Ag Lab can do those.  
**[1:34:01-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:01):**  We've always used Noble actually, because Noble's 45 minutes away from me.  Oh yeah.  And call them and ask them where to go get your stuff tested.  
**[1:34:10-1:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:10):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I mean, I used to send it to them.  
**[1:34:13-1:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:13):**  I sent it to A&M, I think last time is where we sent it.  But, uh, but yeah, we always use Noble for, for a lot of stuff.  I sent a lot of manure samples to A&M.  
**[1:34:25-1:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:25):**  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  Yep.  
**[1:34:26-1:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:26):**  They have a, well, I haven't seen it in a few years.  I'm pretty sure they're still doing it.  They have a program called, uh, GAN Lab, Grazing Animal Nutrition Lab.  
**[1:34:36-1:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:36):**  You send them a fecal sample and you tell them what kind of critter it came from and  they'll tell you what she needs to perform better.  Oh, no kidding.  
**[1:34:43-1:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:43):**  Fecal analysis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:34:45-1:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:45):**  Yeah. Whether she needs energy or protein or this mineral, this nutrient or whatever.  Really?  I'm going to look into that.  
**[1:34:51-1:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:34:51):**  Cause I, I bet that would have helped me last year because I switched mineral programs last  year and my cow weren't doing very well.  And, uh, but this year they're doing a lot better at least.  
**[1:35:03-1:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:35:03):**  I feel like, I guess we'll see once calves start all, they're all on the ground and go  back to rebreeding, but.  I will have to, we'll have to talk about mineral water some other time.  
**[1:35:16-1:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:35:16):**  So yeah, we will supplement, but, and I get that, you know, everybody's ranch is going  to be different, need a different, different supplement program.  Oh, what, um, what did you see different in working facilities down in Brazil that stuck  
**[1:35:36-1:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:35:36):**  out anything?  They're all made out of wood.  Okay.  
**[1:35:41-1:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:35:41):**  One, I mean, that's just cause all the wood that they use for their, for their crowds  and stuff, they, it came straight off the land, you know?  And, uh, so I mean, there's that, the shoots are really nice.  
**[1:35:55-1:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:35:55):**  Uh, they have, um, uh, I forget what the name is, but they're made out of wood and they're  really quiet or a lot more quiet than the, uh, you know, metal clanky.  They're not clanky and they have, they'll have three sections where in the middle section,  
**[1:36:11-1:36:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:36:11):**  they'll have like gate kind of like a door that shuts them on their side.  Also, you know how on a regular shoot though, entire sidle.  Yeah.  
**[1:36:20-1:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:36:20):**  The squeeze close the squeeze.  Well, they'll have one in the middle just to do that.  Okay.  
**[1:36:25-1:36:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:36:25):**  Sometimes, but, and, uh, the crowds, not, not a whole lot different.  Sometimes just work the cattle the way, the way they'll go in pretty much.  I, I kind of feel like I want to make a comment right now that when you're working  
**[1:36:45-1:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:36:45):**  in a set of wooden corrals, you've got to use a lot less pressure than you do.  If you're working in a set of pipe corrals or steel corrals.  And I think that, I think that since we have a lot of, you know, really strong,  
**[1:36:59-1:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:36:59):**  super strong working facilities in this country, it's let us get complacent with  our stockmanship and push too hard, too fast and get away with it because we've  got really strong pants.  
**[1:37:10-1:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:37:10):**  You're like, Oh, well, if they run in, they're not going to break anything.  And, uh, no, I understand what you mean.  I mean, in Brazil too, you know, cause they have no Lori and the lawyer.  
**[1:37:20-1:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:37:20):**  They can be pretty crazy, but if they're boss, yeah.  If you work them fine, you know, if you work them, uh, low stress, there's no issue.  They go in, uh, I was helping them out at that first ranch, just work some calves,  
**[1:37:37-1:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:37:37):**  some bulls, and there was one bull that didn't want to go.  Didn't want to go in, just would not go in.  Well, we worked a 60 and he always stayed in the back in the, in the small  
**[1:37:51-1:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:37:51):**  holding pin before the alleyway.  And he would not go in the alleyway.  We just wouldn't go in, wouldn't go in.  
**[1:37:57-1:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:37:57):**  We let another group come in and he'd be with them.  The entire group would go in, no problem.  He just kept back.  
**[1:38:04-1:38:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:04):**  So two of the Cowboys just went in there afterwards and just grabbed him and just  pushed them in the, in the alleyway.  And then, you know, he went on, but I asked them, I was like, do  
**[1:38:13-1:38:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:13):**  y'all even have a hot shot here?  They go, no, we don't need a hot shot.  You know, they don't need a hot shot.  
**[1:38:20-1:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:20):**  They don't, they're not yelling or not screaming at them.  They're not whipping them.  It's just, you know, you have a stick, just tap them on the butt.  
**[1:38:32-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:32):**  They understand.  Yeah.  And you know, here, it just, I see it way too often.  
**[1:38:41-1:38:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:41):**  There was, there was one place I went to for, I was, uh, just to  help out on my, uh, palpation skills.  And it was a family's operation while they had the kids with hot shots, you  
**[1:38:54-1:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:38:54):**  know, all the cows would be in the alleyway and I was working the cows up to the  chute and they were going just fine the way I was doing it well, then, you know,  their little girl gets the hot shot.  
**[1:39:03-1:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:03):**  The cows can't go anywhere.  And she's just sitting there, hot shot them on the side, on their side.  And the, and the, you know, the parents didn't care.  
**[1:39:10-1:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:10):**  Well, the parents also had a border Collie, right.  At the, at, at the chute, every time the cow would go into the chute,  bite the side of the cow, and when the cow had leave the chute bite the  
**[1:39:20-1:39:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:20):**  cow, whenever they leave the chute.  And the entire time it was just so stressful on the animals that like, you  know, you look at the cows are going crazy.  
**[1:39:29-1:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:29):**  There's slobber coming off of them.  Then the way I was everything that's been done to them.  They remember every time they get, they get gathered up stuffed in a set  
**[1:39:38-1:39:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:38):**  of pans and thrown down a chute.  They remember it every time.  I'm not sure they remember people, individual people, but I can damn sure  
**[1:39:48-1:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:39:48):**  tell you they remember every trip through that career, the trip through  the chute or every trip on that truck.  And one thing I understand is that every time I'm around my animals, I'm training  
**[1:40:01-1:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:01):**  them, learning from me, every time.  Every day.  I mean, I can't even drive into the pasture on the other side from where  
**[1:40:15-1:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:15):**  they're at without changing grazing behavior, change a little bit, but every  time you go out and you mess with those animals, it changes.  So what I'm getting at is every time they go through the  
**[1:40:27-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:27):**  chute, they're going to get grumpy.  I mean, I put together my herd, at a two different sale barns and a  buddy's and one of my good buddies calls.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:37):**  That's what I put together my cows from.  And with Corrientes and crosses, you're going to get some, you're  going to get some retired ropers.  
**[1:40:45-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:45):**  You get some cows that are retired ropers and 363 days out of the year.  They're calm.  They're gentle.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:40:56):**  They don't run from me.  We get in that corral and there's about half of them that remember their rodeo days.  And they don't want to be in those corrals.  
**[1:41:05-1:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:41:05):**  There's some of them, there's a couple of them that would fit down  the alley and through the chute.  We just don't send them because they're, I mean, they're a little bit wild.  
**[1:41:14-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:41:14):**  And I'm not afraid to admit that they're making really nice calves.  All my calves, all my yearlings, all my two year olds, they've all gone down.  And something I really would like to try is to have a day, to have a bluff day,  
**[1:41:31-1:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:41:31):**  like bring them all in, bring them all into the pens, sort your groups out,  run them down the chute and instead of doing anything, let them stand  in the chute for 30 seconds and eat cake out of a bucket.  
**[1:41:46-1:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:41:46):**  Just make it calm.  Make it calm and give them a really nice reward when they're standing in that chute.  I think that would really help, especially if a guy did it, you know, on your calves  
**[1:41:58-1:42:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:41:58):**  the first time your calves ran through.  Instead of running them through that first time and jabbing needles in them and,  you know, branding them and doing whatever you're going to do, run them in, let  
**[1:42:08-1:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:08):**  them eat a half a pound of cake out of a bucket that you're holding and then turn it out.  And that way, the next time, I bet you the next time, at least half of them  will be like, oh, that wasn't bad last time I got a trick that I ran down there and got squeezed.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:22):**  Maybe we'll, maybe that's okay.  We'll go do that again.  It was like some of my anger, but I'm not going to do that.  
**[1:42:28-1:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:28):**  It was like some of my Angus cows, uh, that the ones that we bought, you know,  they'd run into the chute and have to catch them and stuff super fast.  Well, now some of them get to where like, here's the head catch and they're like,  
**[1:42:44-1:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:44):**  just, are you going to do it?  Are you going to catch one?  You know, they, they let me catch their neck.  
**[1:42:48-1:42:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:48):**  They I've just gone super calm with them.  So now they're like, okay, it's not that bad.  He's just going to do what he's got to do.  
**[1:42:55-1:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:42:55):**  And then I'm out.  I have one of my Korean days that she will look at.  She'll walk into the chute, look at me and do that.  
**[1:43:01-1:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:01):**  Like she'll just walk up there and get her and just work through and let  me gently close the head gate on.  And there's some of them that are so fast going through there.  
**[1:43:10-1:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:10):**  Like I got a little hydraulic chute last year.  Oh yeah.  I make sure I'm running WFO.  
**[1:43:16-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:16):**  So those things are fast, but I've got relief valves on them.  So if I do get a missed catch, it's not going to crush anything.  Anything, man, there's, there's some of them that just, that come down through  
**[1:43:26-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:26):**  there and know how to work their horns through that alley and shoot fast.  I get, yeah, I think I had like three or four side, three or four, you know,  belly catches on the head gate.  
**[1:43:37-1:43:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:37):**  Last time.  We, uh, I used to work at a vet clinic around here and it was funny watching  the, the Longhorns, they, they, you know, make their head go like this and they go  
**[1:43:46-1:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:46):**  down the alley because they know the drill, but the alley there was a little bit.  A little bit shorter.  So they put their head pretty much like this, just going down the chute and  
**[1:43:56-1:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:43:56):**  everything, doo, doo, doo.  Yeah.  And you know, they know exactly where the tips of those horns are at every  
**[1:44:05-1:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:44:05):**  second of their life and a fly doesn't land on one of those things and they don't  know it, it's not like it's, you know, an inanimate weapon that they can't feel.  I mean, they've got feeling in that thing all the way to the tip.  
**[1:44:16-1:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:44:16):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, and, you know, that was one thing that I didn't like about the Brahmas was  
**[1:44:23-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:44:23):**  dehorning because that was so stressful when it came time to do it.  And if you did it the younger, they were the better.  But if you miss that point where they're not just little buttons anymore, you  
**[1:44:36-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:44:36):**  know, it, it causes a lot of stress on them and, uh, yeah, yeah.  That was, that was one thing I really wish that the Brahma is, cause now  they're doing a lot more pulled.  
**[1:44:47-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:44:47):**  But I wish that was something they had really focused on 20 years ago and  started really implemented then to try and, you know, get away from that.  Because even when they throw it in the, on their, on their F1 crosses, sometimes  
**[1:45:01-1:45:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:45:01):**  those can be even worse than the Brahma, you know, like the, uh, the F1 tiger stripes.  Yeah.  And I, you know, I've had, we had guys that go in there at that vet clinic to  
**[1:45:12-1:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:45:12):**  dehorn and man, it was, you know, the amount of blood and stress that would  come out of it sometimes cause they don't do it on time.  They don't do it when they, you know, need to do it when they're calves and stuff.  
**[1:45:25-1:45:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:45:25):**  And it's, it's just super stressful process on that.  And I agree with that.  I've had people ask me in the last couple of years, if I was going to  
**[1:45:35-1:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:45:35):**  dehorn and for a while, I kind of went back and forth, but yeah, maybe I  should, you know, maybe I should dehorn my calves, maybe I should dehorn all  my calves when they're born so I don't have to worry about it.  
**[1:45:49-1:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:45:49):**  And the more I thought about it, whether you believe in God or not, whether God  give them the horns or whether they evolved with them, they got them for a reason.  Exactly.  
**[1:46:01-1:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:01):**  Yeah.  You know, and I, I better have a good reason to take them away.  And I really don't, I'm just going to try to naturally breed them out and  
**[1:46:10-1:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:10):**  based on this year's calf crop which is out of straight up Angus last year and  my, and my falls, which are out of a fleck the influence sematol they're all  smooth headed.  
**[1:46:24-1:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:24):**  Really?  Yeah.  I haven't even seen any, nothing even really has buds.  
**[1:46:27-1:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:27):**  Right.  Do y'all have, I mean, do y'all have cougars out there?  Yes.  
**[1:46:34-1:46:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:34):**  Actually one that lives here on the river behind my house.  Really?  Well, I say that and I haven't heard her for two years, but there has been one  
**[1:46:44-1:46:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:44):**  living on the river near my house, which is six miles from there.  Yeah.  In Brazil, jaguars are a problem on a lot of operations.  
**[1:46:53-1:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:46:53):**  One of our friends, they would have, which actually it was, excuse me.  Um, the gentleman I went to his ranch in Bolivia, they run about 30,000 head over  there of mama cows and the jaguars at times would take five to 10% of the calf  
**[1:47:11-1:47:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:47:11):**  crop is how bad they would get.  And, uh, you know, at that point, you know, down there, they just have to hunt  them at that point in there, you know, uh, hunting is still legal in Brazil and, uh,  
**[1:47:26-1:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:47:26):**  in Brazil, at least I don't know about, you know, the other countries like Bolivia,  Paraguay and stuff, but,  Well, I imagine you can't just go to the gun store and buy a firearm in Brazil  
**[1:47:35-1:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:47:35):**  either.  So now, now it's different.  Now you can actually, you can own guns there and stuff.  
**[1:47:43-1:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:47:43):**  You, I mean, they, they've really relaxed it a lot.  Um, I don't know the specifics on it, but hunting is still legal except  for hogs in certain States.  
**[1:47:54-1:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:47:54):**  Um, which because before there wasn't, uh, no, there was no hunting in Brazil.  There wasn't, uh, regulations or anything on it.  So, you know, the wildlife population started really getting cut out and, uh,  
**[1:48:10-1:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:10):**  then they just, you know, made it illegal to hunt and, but now, you know, hogs took  off so bad out there that it's, they have to, they have to hunt them now.  Is that a, do you know if that's a recent thing or have they been there for a while  
**[1:48:26-1:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:26):**  and then their population is just getting around to exploding?  Um, it's, it's really exploded.  Um, there was, they've kind of been around for a while, but it not, not like it, it,  
**[1:48:39-1:48:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:39):**  it is now at least they just exploded way too much.  And I mean, it's, it's gotten really bad there.  If not worse than like here in Texas, it seems like.  
**[1:48:50-1:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:50):**  That was my follow-up is, are you in hog country?  Cause I don't think you are, are you?  Oh yeah.  
**[1:48:55-1:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:55):**  Yeah.  Really?  Oh yeah.  
**[1:48:57-1:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:48:57):**  We're definitely hawker.  Hog has been, there was a hog.  I chased on my four Wheeler.  
**[1:49:01-1:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:01):**  He was in one of my pastures, uh, uh, the other day, but there, cause  I used to raise hog dogs.  I used to raise black mouth curves for hog hunting and, uh, wrote down  
**[1:49:12-1:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:12):**  on my list of questions, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:49:15-1:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:15):**  And then, yeah, I use actually, that's what that back is over there.  That's a bore spear I've never put to good use.  Actually a few more spirits right there that I've been meaning to go after, but.  
**[1:49:26-1:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:26):**  Yeah, the hogs are, they're bad around here.  Really bad.  We got, uh, we got fortunate.  
**[1:49:33-1:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:33):**  The, um, the state never allowed people to hunt them here and our, our animal  health veterinary agency, Kansas, Katie H.  I don't know if that's right, but whoever's responsible for animal  
**[1:49:47-1:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:49:47):**  health in Kansas, that agency, they got with us fish and wildlife, uh, or fish  and game wildlife services division, which the wildlife services division of  fish and game, if I was going to go, if I had to work for the government, that's  
**[1:50:01-1:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:01):**  probably where I'd want to work.  Cause that would be do the cool stuff.  Um, they spent a significant amount of taxpayers money flying around in a jet  
**[1:50:12-1:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:12):**  ranger, hanging out the left side with a shotgun and they'd shotgun these things.  Like just mass wholesale.  Yeah.  
**[1:50:21-1:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:21):**  One of these hogs from the air and they managed to basically hunt them out of my  area for years, they basically hunted them out.  They did another four or five years of trapping and got the last few out.  
**[1:50:34-1:50:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:34):**  And it's been probably three or four years since anybody's seen hog sign up here.  No can cause around like right where my property backs up to the government  land that surrounds Lake Ray Roberts.  
**[1:50:45-1:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:45):**  Okay.  Uh, so, you know, they made it a reservoir and they sectioned off.  So it's all hunting land.  
**[1:50:51-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:50:51):**  It's public hunting land.  Um, Grayson County is the only County in Texas where you can't use a rifle.  It's bow only, but the hogs have so much.  
**[1:51:03-1:51:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:03):**  Place to live around here.  So they, and there's really not a whole lot of hunters and there could be 10 of  you in the area that are all trying to get rid of them and all trying to hunt  
**[1:51:15-1:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:15):**  the shit out of them and that one guy from Dallas that just comes out on the  weekends, doesn't give a crap.  And that's the hog sanctuary.  
**[1:51:23-1:51:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:23):**  Yep.  The w there's a farmer around here.  We actually rented his hog trap, a huge round pin, and it would sit up and he had  
**[1:51:32-1:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:32):**  a game camera and it was all in his app on his phone and so it alert him whenever  the hogs are there and on his app, he just click a button and the whole trap  would just fall right around him.  
**[1:51:42-1:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:42):**  And he, I think he'd send them overseas, like to Europe or something.  It's something like that.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:51:53-1:51:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:53):**  Get them out of there.  May I make them mad to make them into compost?  Yeah.  
**[1:51:59-1:52:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:51:59):**  Well, Hey, I seriously, I'm not even a third away through this question sheet.  We've been going for almost two hours.  Yeah.  
**[1:52:05-1:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:05):**  We're going to, yeah.  If we keep going, this thing is just going to be a monster to edit.  So I tell you what.  
**[1:52:11-1:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:11):**  That's fine.  Let's, let's come back and do a part two in a couple of weeks or a month or two.  Perfect with me.  
**[1:52:18-1:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:18):**  That's fine with me.  All right.  Before we get out of here, you got anything you want to promote traffic?  
**[1:52:23-1:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:23):**  You want to, uh, anywhere you want people to go?  Where can people find you?  How can they get ahold of you?  
**[1:52:28-1:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:28):**  Uh, you find me on my TikTok at least.  Uh, I think it's at DeLeu K C D E L E U K C.  I'll make sure we get the right one.

**[1:52:59-1:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:52:59):**  about checking out Squarespace.  That's what I moved to.  Yeah.

**[1:53:12-1:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/84-Kevin-Deleu-Back-to-Brazil-e1olnaa#t=1:53:12):**  Squarespace is on my short to do list.  Maybe we'll get to that today.  Yeah.

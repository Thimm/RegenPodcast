**[0:00:50-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:00:50):**  Hey gang, RedHillsRancher here with a bonus episode of Ranching Reboot.  And I got a special guest today.  Old friend of mine, we kind of grew up together.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:00:59):**  Our fathers knew each other back in the 80s.  Our mothers knew each other.  So we kind of have a history together and we had a great conversation coming up about  
**[0:01:11-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:01:11):**  clean food and cows and meat.  We even kind of dip a little bit into the Easter day farms conspiracy and, and what's  going on there with Tyson talked about antibiotic use and feedlots and a little bit of the market  
**[0:01:23-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:01:23):**  manipulation and getting a fair price.  And lastly, we kind of dove a little bit into the carcass size.  So this isn't the full conversation.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:01:31):**  This is just a little bit of it.  The rest of it was just between him and I.  So I want to thank you guys for tuning in.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:01:37):**  And before I introduce my guest, a couple of things I want to tell you about him.  He is a two time cancer survivor.  That's right.  
**[0:01:45-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:01:45):**  He has survived.  He's beat cancer twice.  It's my neighbor, my friend, Brendan Wheelock.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:00):**  So theoretically, you know, just like with your experience with changing your diet and  helping you get over cancer twice.  Yeah.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:08):**  You know, let's extend that out to how we feed our livestock.  Okay.  So we feed them a lot of, you know, processed grains now, you know, dry distillers, grains,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:18):**  wet distillers, grains, you know, okay, so that's a semi processed product.  It's had a lot of the sugars removed from it.  Right.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:26):**  You know, and those things are, you know, all those crops are grown usually in a monoculture  system and they have to use a lot of herbicides and pesticides in order to keep the crop healthy  and protect it, you know, crop protection.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:40):**  That's just, oh, the term crop protection bothers me so much.  I mean, like, it's what it, let's call it what it is.  It's chemical warfare against nature is what it is.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:02:53):**  Yeah.  A lot of those, a lot of those chemicals were developed because of the war.  Well, they came out of, you know, a lot of them can trace their roots back to Nazi weapons  
**[0:03:04-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:03:04):**  programs in World War I and even back to World War II, I'm sorry, World War II and back to  World War I.  I mean, and some of these same companies are still, you know, that produced chemicals during  
**[0:03:18-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:03:18):**  the Holocaust.  Some of these companies literally still exist and operate under almost the same name.  Yeah, I've just learned all that in the last couple of months too.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:03:29):**  I mean, that just, that should just blow everybody's mind.  That was one of the tasks that my, whoop, go ahead.  So we were back, you know, back to talking about like herbicide and pesticide residue.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:03:43):**  You know, we all, we know it's on the crop and maybe it's an amount so small that you  can't really detect it.  And then we're feeding it, you know, to cattle or to other livestock and, you know, it takes  
**[0:03:56-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:03:56):**  seven pounds of grain to make one pound of beef.  So all these toxins, all these toxins, you know, they all build up, you know, they're  in the feed that, that all gets sprayed.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:04:09):**  They're in all the crops that get sprayed that we process into feed.  And then we put them into the, into the animal that stay in a feedlot.  Have you, have you ever seen a healthy liver from a feedlot animal?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:04:23):**  Now that's where it's, uh, that's where it shows up as a lot of them have bad lungs and  livers.  So like, and I think, and I think this was even a problem with a lot of cattle back,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:04:38):**  you know, last year, you know, when the, when the supply chain totally started to break  down and, and plants backed up and, you know, feedlots backed up and you had, you know,  two month over finished cattle that were standing in a feedlot that weighed, you know, 1800  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:04:54):**  pounds and they weren't healthy.  Yeah.  Right.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:04:59):**  So it's, it's a good correlation.  You know, it's like, they started reading those cattle.  Well, just like the whole problem with the frames we've been producing a product because  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:09):**  it's cheaper to buy the animal once and put twice as much weight on them than it is by  the animal twice.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:16):**  That's why we've been injecting all this grain size to put up, pack all that meat on.  But who, who benefits more from a big animal that's inefficient to keep?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:27):**  It's made the producers program way more inefficient because of it.  But that's what that's what all the industries told us to do.  Make your cattle bigger, make your cattle bigger.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:38):**  We need bigger carcass size.  You need this carcass trait.  You need this carcass trait.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:42):**  I mean, every podcast you listen to, you know, that's, that's con you know, more on the conventional  production side.  That's what all the ads are screaming at you to do.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:53):**  You need this carcass trait.  You need this breed.  You need this.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:05:56):**  You need this.  And you know, okay, we need to look past breed and start looking at what genetics suit our  environment.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah.  That's a, it's information I was oblivious to naive.  I feel stupid about it now fighting this battle out here against an invisible something that  
**[0:06:23-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:06:23):**  I thought was invisible and then you then it's in front of your face all of a sudden.  You know, and I know we're going broke and creating a product for a man, a system that's  stealing from us.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:06:41):**  Losing liquid.  You learn things the first time that happens to you.  Better.  
**[0:06:48-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:06:48):**  Well, if you don't, you might not get a second try.  And you know, there's two ways out of it.  Okay.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:07:01):**  There's two ways out of it.  Number one is we start reducing our reliance on inputs.  We start making more of what of what we can have with just sunshine and rain.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:07:15):**  You know, we make the most of our native forages, we get better at using them and we reduce  all of our synthetic inputs.  Second thing that we can do to really start changing things is we got to have a grassroots  
**[0:07:27-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:07:27):**  effort in every community that's in cattle country to have small packing plants like  this and just to just a big enough packing plant to serve the needs of the community.  That's all it has to be.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:07:42):**  So we're not talking about totally dismantling, you know, the sale barn feedlot commodity  system.  That's not what we're talking about.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:07:49):**  What we're talking about is, is food security and bringing prosperity back to rule America  by putting small local meat plants everywhere.  Because that puts more money, that's more money in the ranchers pocket.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:04):**  That's more money coming back to the ranchers gate.  And that's a lot more money staying in that community and provide a lot of great jobs  for the community.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:12):**  I mean, there's a lot of food around here.  It's crazy that we have these cows readily available.  We send them to Pratt, you know, just your cows that you're done with that are not producing  
**[0:08:27-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:27):**  age anymore.  Yeah, you're going to cows.  You have a problem, you know, your coals.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:36):**  That's what these grocery stores buy back.  They're not buying the good meat that's corn fed out of the feedlots anyways.  No, that's going to restaurants.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:43):**  All that stuff goes to restaurants and export.  Yep.  And nobody knows that when they go down to the whites and buy their food, they're not  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:08:52):**  buying the best of the best.  They're buying junk.  I mean, sometimes they might run a holiday special or something and buy better meat,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:00):**  but all the most of the burgers, nobody knows where it comes from and why.  And that cow goes thousands of miles and ends up back here in a box when she was within  a mile of that grocery store to begin with.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:16):**  Yeah.  And it's like that in every rural community, you know, it's like that everywhere.  There's yeah, there's no traceability for for anything, you know, and you had you're  
**[0:09:28-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:28):**  absolutely right.  You know, and I think I'll give whites a little bit of credit because I think they actually  do, you know, they do buy larger cuts and then they then they cut on site and they break  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:39):**  them down.  Yeah.  And I think they even do some of their own grinding.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:43):**  But you know, that's that's obviously the model everywhere.  Yeah, I don't know there.  I'm just using it as an example of I know what happens when that meat ends up at Walmart,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:53):**  you know?  Yeah.  Where it comes from.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:09:56):**  You know, Walmart, Walmart's not going to go to Kiowa Locker.  And say, hey, Kiowa Locker for our Pratt and Alva stores, we want this, this and this and  this.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:10:07):**  No, they're going to go to Tyson or to JBS or to Smithfield or Marfrigg.  I think I think they do most of their sourcing from Tyson actually, with their beef.  They're going to go to Tyson and they're going to say, Tyson, we're going to buy this much  
**[0:10:22-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:10:22):**  beef from you next year at this price for all of our stores.  And Tyson says, Okay.  Because that because they know they've got a monopoly.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah, did you see that deal about them having 2 million head gone?  From one of one of their suppliers that embezzled 2 million head and that they're gonna long  to find it.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:10:45):**  Yeah, I, I did read about that.  And it's really like, and you don't know what to believe.  And you know that there's, you're talking about the Easter Day deal up in the up in  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:10:57):**  the Pacific Northwest, right?  Exactly.  Well, you don't really know what to believe.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:01):**  Okay, so it's a family operation.  They've got cattle and they've got grass and they've got farming and then they've got a  feedlot and they're all interconnected.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:10):**  Yeah.  And then I just think it's a little bit odd, I guess that that the patriarch of that family  died in a head on collision on the highway with one of his farms trucks, like right after  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:29):**  all this shit broke.  Oh, really?  Like like, how does that happen?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:35):**  Okay.  So the CEO of Easter Day Farms dies in a car accident.  He turns his pickup onto the highway going the wrong way and get hit gets hit by an Easter  
**[0:11:47-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:47):**  Day Farms semi that was hauling probably grain or some other commodity.  And he dies.  Ah, that's cute.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah.  And then there's you know, then there's Tyson saying, well, there's these cattle that don't  exist and yeah, and then the guy is conveniently dead.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:12:10):**  So it really, it really makes you wonder.  Yeah, how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, how deep does this shit go?

I know a lot of stuff turns out that way, the more you more you follow it.  It makes me not want to dance with corporations.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:12:38):**  Yeah, for sure.  I have family high up in the chain.  And it's like, I used to think that we were on the same team.  
**[0:12:48-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:12:48):**  And now I see that we're not and that makes things a little awkward.  Yeah, it's, you know, it's, it's hard to talk about some of these issues in certain crowds,  because, you know, because people don't want to listen, or they know something that they  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:13:09):**  don't want you to talk about.  Right, right.  They don't want to answer them.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:13:14):**  They don't want to answer the hard questions they know you're going to ask.  Yeah, like, I don't want to mention, I don't want to name any names.  But recently, I listened to a feedlot veterinarian speak.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:13:27):**  And it was a it was a really great conversation.  And he used a great quote, which I think is actually a Bud Williams quote, you can't fix  poor nutrition with a needle.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:13:40):**  Right.  Okay, I totally get that.  That'd be organic on some level.  
**[0:13:46-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:13:46):**  And then not even 10 minutes later, he basically told us that every animal that comes into  his feedlot, it comes off the truck and gets a shot of antibiotic.  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:00):**  Like, you know, I knew it was bad.  Okay.  You know, you know, what's bad, I think 75 80% of the antibiotics manufactured by weight,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:11):**  go into cattle.  Yeah, that's why I had that meeting with this guy that wants to buy my calves off the farm  because they've never had antibiotics and they've never had an implant yet.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:23):**  Now he's going to give him an implant, but he's not going to do the antibiotics.  I quit giving implants everything about four years ago, once I learned, you know, just  simply because you get a premium for not having it.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:37):**  Yeah, is they want to be the first ones to give it whoever the next guy is down the road.  That's a shame.  Yeah, but they don't, they don't want the NHTC cattle.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:46):**  They don't want they don't want the certification.  They just want to be the one to put it in there because they want to buy your smaller  calf at a discount.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:14:54):**  Because I'm gonna use the drug.  Yeah, I haven't had that exposure yet.  Yep.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:00):**  Because they want to choose when to put it in that animal like, you know, I can get why  I can get why.  It does work.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:11):**  It'll make them bigger, faster, more efficient, you know, talking 17 loads of corn to finish  one semi load of cattle.  That's ridiculous.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:22):**  And that's why they build the feedlots where the corn is raised.  Because it's, you know, it's cheaper to ship the cattle to the corn because the cattle  are the higher value product.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:32):**  You move one semi load of cattle to where the 17 semi loads of corn is.  Instead of shipping corn from Iowa, you know, and a lot of those northern states, yeah,  they can grow corn but the weather makes the cattle less efficient because in color trying  
**[0:15:47-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:47):**  to stay warm.  That's why Kansas works good in Oklahoma until we get a polar vortex like we just right and  we're not set up for that.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:15:57):**  That showcases the market manipulation that those guys have is box beef was going up through  all that and they find a way to knock fat cattle down.  When it's no secret that the markets usually love a storm because it disintegrates millions  
**[0:16:14-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:16:14):**  of pounds of beef off the off the cattle because they're walking around trying to stay warm  burning calories instead of packing them away on their frame.  Yeah, it's a big old chain.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:16:28):**  At least pay us for it.  I mean, that's what got me interested in what the heck's going on is not getting paid for  something that I know we should how much money they're making handling them cattle for 24  
**[0:16:41-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:16:41):**  hours just doing logistics and storage and  the checkoff has tricked us has tricked us into growing steak and paying us hamburger  price.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:16:56):**  I mean, that's what they've tricked us into.  Yeah, and we pay them.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:05):**  Just screw us.  Yeah.  I want 1940 1950 genetics, you know, that are made to grow on grass before they started  
**[0:17:14-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:14):**  the corn thing and the frame crap.  Hey, I want I want to grass finish organic and because I want to eat it too.  I know that that's what my family needs to eat and then sure me with my cancer stuff.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:30):**  I mean, yeah, so okay.  People complain about the taste.  Well, that's because you're you're eating basically corn flavor steak fat.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:40):**  Yeah, yeah, butter corn flavored fat butter and and you know that we're not supposed to  eat that stuff.  It's not I mean, it's a it's a luxury when you go to dinner on a Friday night.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:53):**  It's not stuff you want in your fridge that you feed your family seven days a week like  I do.  Right.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:17:58):**  I mean, my I have customers that like buying fat cattle.  So when I have an odd, you know, usually big ones, when I have a load of cattle ready,  I'll sort two or three big ones off that are going to sell for the same price as an animal  
**[0:18:13-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:18:13):**  that's 200 pounds lighter.  So I put them on corn feeders and sell them to guys that is that's what the flavor they  want when they're buying a you know, it's a big purchase to side of beef for a half  
**[0:18:26-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:18:26):**  of a beef for a local community family member around here.  You know, you're talking about having to come up with 1000 bucks out of your pocket plus  plus processing.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah, so they want that luxury flavor.  Because it's kind of a Cadillac item to have corn fed beef in your freezer.  But if you've had health issues and have awakened to reality, then you know, that's not what  
**[0:18:58-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:18:58):**  you want your kid to eat.  You know, that's what I keep in my freezer because that's what we raise.  And we do burger steak or a variation breakfast sausage made from goat or something seven  
**[0:19:10-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:19:10):**  days a week.  And it needs to be healthier than it is.  I don't do implants and I don't do antibiotics with the cattle that I finished but I still  
**[0:19:19-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:19:19):**  on finish.  Yeah, and that I've got the first set of cattle that are a year old now that have been organic  ground and it'll be one more year a whole nother year before they're ready to kill.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:19:36):**  Grass finished, but it's an inefficient process because they're so big.  It takes a long time and a lot of miles and then you have all that bone that was designed  for feedlot, you know, to carry a feedlot carcass around not a grass carcass.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:19:53):**  So I gotta get I gotta start over with different cows is what I've learned.  And that's that's a big swing for me, you know, to completely change your program on  800 or 900 mother cows.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:20:06):**  Yeah, buddy, I can see how that'd be a big switch.  I tell you what great conversation Brendan and I had.  And that wasn't really the end of it that went on for quite a while we got on a few  
**[0:20:19-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:20:19):**  rabbit trails that I'd rather not share with everybody else.  So just wanted to share this piece of it with you.  Thanks for joining me on this little special edition bonus episode ranching reboot.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-4-with-Brenden-Wheelock-Current-state-of-the-Cattle-Business-ersf2l#t=0:20:30):**  I'm Red Hills rancher.  You guys have a great day.

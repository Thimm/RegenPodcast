For this week we go out to California to visit a ranch that's been around since 1897.  But before we get into that, last week I mentioned some of the new links that are showing up  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:00:59):**  in the show notes page.  One of those is my link tree.  Well, I've made a few changes.

**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:01:41):**  Zoom for the actual recording of the podcast.  Being able to ask questions.  How about a live Q&A with me?

**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:05):**  Native from just north of the Bay Area, Lauren Poncha from Stemple Creek Ranch.  Lauren Poncha, good to see you buddy.  How you doing?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:12):**  I'm good.  I'm good.  How are you?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:15):**  I'm great.  You know, I don't do too many of these first thing in the morning.  I woke up this morning.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:19):**  We've got two inches of snow, it's 25 degrees and a 45 mile an hour north wind.  So I'm looking forward to getting out and feeding cows here in a little bit.  Well, I can't say the same here.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:32):**  It's still dark outside here and it's about 40 degrees probably.  And it's going to be epic sunshine, probably about 60 in the middle of the day.  And our grass is about this tall right now in a lot of places.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:46):**  So we're loving it right now.  But we are in a pretty major drought.  And it's hard to say that when you look at my grass, but the hill country is drying up  
**[0:02:57-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:02:57):**  fast and we haven't had a rain event in almost three months.  And this is the dead of winter.  So we should be having rain, you know, a couple times a week.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:09):**  Yeah.  See, we're the other way here.  Like winter is generally our dry season.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:15):**  And I like to have, I was just looking at my drought plan the other day and I like to  have like four inches before April 1st.  And before the moisture that started last night, we had about an inch and a half.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah, so it's pretty gruesomely dry.  So before we get too much deeper in this, Lauren, why don't you tell our listeners where  you're at?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah, I'm Lauren Pontius, Stemple Creek Ranch, and I'm in Northern California.  Where I'm sitting right now is the old schoolhouse that I went to preschool in and it's about  56 miles north of San Francisco, straight north on the coast, or about four miles from  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:52):**  the ocean.  Nice, nice.  So your family's been there for quite a while, haven't they?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:03:58):**  My family, yeah, legacy started here 1897.  My great grandfather immigrated from Garzano, Italy, with the sole purpose of coming to  this area to raise food for the Bay Area, which is pretty cool.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:04:11):**  So I'm the fourth generation, my kids are the fifth generation.  Actually, Brian, you've been here.  You got to see it when it was in good shape back in April, a few years ago.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:04:20):**  Yeah, that was great.  I really enjoyed that tour.  And I was sitting here this morning, getting ready for this, trying to remember some things  
**[0:04:31-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:04:31):**  about that tour, some good questions to ask you.  So what do you do there on Stemple Creek Ranch?  Well Stemple Creek Ranch right now is our brand that's basically go to market, but we  
**[0:04:46-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:04:46):**  raise beef cattle, grass fed beef, lamb, grass fed lamb and pork, it's pasture raised pork.  But the beef is a big majority of our business.  And we harvest that and sell it direct to consumers really all over the nation, but  
**[0:05:05-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:05:05):**  also mostly Bay Area centric and California centric is the majority of our business.  Right.  And I can only imagine what it would be like living that close to that much population  
**[0:05:24-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:05:24):**  that's concerned about their health and wants to eat better.  So can you talk about maybe some of the experiences you've had in the last couple of years with  people from the city that don't know much about their food production and the food production  
**[0:05:41-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:05:41):**  cycle that you've been selling to that have changed their viewpoint on food, I guess?  Well, you know, Brian, what you bring up there is a pretty interesting point because it's  very easy for us in agriculture to assume that people don't know anything about agriculture.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:06:01):**  And it's really the exact opposite here in the Bay Area, in my opinion, everything, I'll  probably refer to it more than once today, but everything is a bell shaped curve, right?  Ranchers, ranchers, people, you know, consumers, and you got the extreme right and extreme  
**[0:06:18-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:06:18):**  left.  And in this area, our number one customer already knows quite a bit about agriculture  and about regenerative agriculture and the reasons why they want grass fed and, you know,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:06:31):**  the difference between grass fed and grass finished.  And a lot of that are, there's some very sophisticated, well educated people out here that have money  that want to vote with their dollars and support what they think is the right thing.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:06:50):**  And they're, they're already really educated.  That being said, we have this great space out here at the ranch.  And we're super blessed.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:06:58):**  Honestly, we're super blessed to be able to be this close to a big population.  Because I know a lot of our friends that we both we both know, all over the country, they're,  you know, 10 hours from a kill point or 10 hours from a major, a major city, you can't  
**[0:07:15-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:07:15):**  do what we're doing as simply when you're in the middle of Nebraska as if you're, you  know, an hour and a half from the Golden Gate Bridge or an hour from the Golden Gate Bridge.  So we open up our ranch a lot to help educate that section of the consumer that you were  
**[0:07:34-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:07:34):**  talking about, that isn't very, you know, it doesn't know a lot about agriculture, or  maybe thinks that cows have caused global warming, and you know, all of these types  of things.  
**[0:07:46-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:07:46):**  And we're really blessed to be able to, to be able to help get people to come to the  farm and we have a competitive advantage to sell our meat because we're right here, people  can do a day trip, they can come and stay at the ranch.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:08:01):**  We have three little Airbnbs here, they can break bread with us and drink a glass of wine  and eat some steak together and hear our whole story.  They can, if they maybe they want to, frankly, they can go out in the middle of field and  
**[0:08:14-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:08:14):**  say I want cow number 1234 in a year and a half and I'd say sure everything I'll do whatever  you want.  So we're basically trying to adapt and change to tell our story and educate people on the  
**[0:08:28-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:08:28):**  environmental benefits of the of what we're doing.  And at the same time, provide a super nutrient dense high quality food that we feel good  about raising and that consumers feel good about buying and feeding their families.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:08:45):**  Okay, so how do we know that it's nutrient dense food?  Because that's what I say it is.  I don't confuse you with the facts.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:08:54):**  It's nutrient dense food, beef in a feedlot is nutrient dense food, beef in a out in a  beef out in a pasture is nutrient dense food.  Beef in general is very nutrient dense and I'm a disciple of Diana Rogers and love her  
**[0:09:10-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:09:10):**  work and I think she tells a good a very good story and an accurate story about there is  no other there is no other food on the planet that is full of vitamins, nutrients and minerals.  And you can get into an argument about whether it's you know, the right kind of fats, you  
**[0:09:29-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:09:29):**  know, more more, like the difference between omega three eggs, omega, more omega threes  and less omega sixes and all that.  And I don't really go there.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:09:42):**  I say you know, our our beef tastes, tastes great.  It's better for the animals better for for the planet, because we're actually creating  photosynthesis and and it's better for the people eating it.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:09:53):**  I don't get into all the details of why and you know, we have more beta carotene and all  this stuff because I'm not 100% sure all of that is 100% accurate all the time.  So I'd rather just be honest about it.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:10:10):**  Honestly, transparency and quality are like our core tenants.  I want them to taste that meat and say, man, that's the best piece I've ever tasted.  And what like what better than what I got from Walmart or exactly like what they see  
**[0:10:22-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:10:22):**  and like us and want to support us.  And I don't want to get too confused or make it us versus them.  I just want people to eat more meat.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:10:32):**  And before our time is over, we should talk about that too, because the amount of vegans  that we've converted to eat meat is is stunning.  So we can talk more about that before our time's over.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:10:44):**  Well, let's let's talk about it.  I think it's like you were talking about nutrient density.  And one of the one of the things that we need to remember those of us that are kind of in  
**[0:10:53-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:10:53):**  this regenerative sphere is not to talk down to other production methods and not to try  to demonize or attack other production methods just to present the other side of the story.  Like this is what we do.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:11:10):**  And this is why not saying that other way is bad or that that the other thing is bad.  But this is just how we do it.  And this is why.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:11:19):**  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of throwing stones, especially in the industry, and I look at  our industry and like son of a gun.  All the time I get people saying, oh, you guys are grass fed.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:11:34):**  You know, I have tons of friends in the industry that are, you know, feedlot operators all  the way down to grass fed people like me.  And it's like, hey, guys, we're working, we should be working together to get more people  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:11:45):**  to eat beef in general.  Because the more people that eat beef, they're going to eat grain fed, grass fed, whatever.  And it's better for the whole industry.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:11:55):**  And some people might, you know, frankly, I work with a lot of other producers that  they actually they actually raised some cattle for me as part of our program, but they're  pretty conventional producers, you know, a bunch of their cattle go into feedlots and,  
**[0:12:12-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:12:12):**  you know, corn, corn fed beef, and you know, a small section of 10 10% or so of their herd  comes to me before it goes to a feedlot.  And so it's like, you know, we can do both.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:12:27):**  And the part about that, that to me is kind of crazy is right now, the industry, the grass  fed industry and and you would have to fact check me on this, but it's, I think I'm pretty  close plus or minus 10%.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:12:42):**  There's like, like 85 plus percent of the beef, the grass fed beef that's in grocery  stores, and consumers are eating here in America through places like butcher box and home delivery  services.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:12:56):**  It's, it's foreign beef, it's coming from other countries.  And it's like, hello, I don't need to check you on that one.  That's that's close enough.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:13:04):**  It's like, come on, guys, why do we want to, you know, import all this other grass fed  beef when we could be making a premium at the farm level.  And then export all of our really good stuff to China or, you know, Hong Kong or Japan  
**[0:13:19-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:13:19):**  is it's it's kind of silly the system right now.  But it is what it is.  And really, the whole reason why I'm doing this grass fed grass finished beef is because  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:13:30):**  I had to figure out a way to make a living here on the ranch with only a finite amount  of acres.  I mean, we can talk for the whole show just about that too.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:13:39):**  It's a situation that a lot of guys are in, you know, they've reached the carrying capacity  of the cows, they can't add more cows to the ranch.  We can agree that, you know, if you don't have enough grass for your cows to eat, it  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:13:53):**  doesn't make a whole lot of sense to go buy a bunch of hay to haul hay out to your cows  in the middle of the pasture.  So it's, you know, you have to maximize the resource that you've got.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:14:02):**  Once you've maximized the production on your resource, you've got to start maximizing the  return on that.  And you know, if you're not a 10,000 acre outfit in the Nebraska Sandhills anymore that  
**[0:14:11-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:14:11):**  selling pot loads of calves, you got to find some of these direct marketing channels.  Right.  And and consumers are consumers are begging for it, really.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:14:23):**  It's not the whole set of consumers, you know, not probably not the flyover states, but both  sides of the country and you know, any, any hubs of people, large, large numbers of people,  they're begging to know where the food comes from.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:14:39):**  Even here in flyover country, we're seeing increased demand for grass fed, we're seeing  increased demand for consumers wanting to connect with the story of their food and directly  connected the producer.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:14:51):**  Like it's, it's spreading here, but I wouldn't say that the the adoption rate is what it  is where you are, or the or the the percentage of people, it's, it's probably lower than  where you are.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:04):**  And I could be wrong.  I mean, it could be just a pretty much, you know, kind of an even level all across the  country.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:10):**  It just doesn't seem like that out here.  Because, you know, we don't have, we don't have 5 million people living 40 minutes away.  Well, get ready, though, get ready, because what's happened, I mean, we'll probably talk  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:22):**  about this later, we have a lot of time to talk.  But I mean, there's a mass exodus of California, and they're going all the places where you're  all at right now.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:31):**  And and messing everything up in one way, but they're also a whole new set of consumers  that's used to eating one way, you know, it's maybe a huge opportunity.  So I always look at things, you know, is this an opportunity or a threat?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:43):**  What's the best way to handle it?  But I mean, we were basically growing up here in the business, we were basically making  enough money that we could do it for one more year, and then we'd make enough money that  
**[0:15:55-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:15:55):**  we could do it for one more year.  And my background, when I went away to college, I was dead set on coming home be a full time  rancher.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:16:05):**  And around my junior year, I realized there was no economic opportunity for me at home  unless I wanted to come home live with my parents and make 1000 bucks a month like a  farmhand or whatever or less, then it was like, No, so we had to bring a new enterprise  
**[0:16:23-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:16:23):**  to our current operation.  And and before today's over, I'd love to talk to you about all the different stack enterprises  we do here at simple but on my list, I want to talk about it.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:16:34):**  Okay, cool.  So we, I went away.  After college, during college, you know, I had to figure out what to do to make a living.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:16:43):**  And I actually did some internships with veterinary pharmaceutical companies.  And I went and I went and moved to Texas, Florida, Georgia, Montana, Wyoming, and then  the Central Valley of California.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:16:59):**  And I sold veterinary pharmaceuticals.  And I did that for 18 years.  But I still had my fingers in the ranch business.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:17:07):**  So I'd fly home on the weekends, or I'd drive over and, and do, do ranch work.  And I was making most of the decisions, but as you can imagine, working with your family,  and then you make a decision, and then you leave for a week and you come back and nothing  
**[0:17:23-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:17:23):**  has been done, it can get very frustrating, right.  And so that was a challenge.  And my real passion, no matter where I was around the country, was the ranch and trying  
**[0:17:35-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:17:35):**  to make agriculture go.  And so about, geez, oh, geez, about 15, 17 years ago now, I was around my 30th birthday,  and I'm 47.  
**[0:17:47-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:17:47):**  So I came home to my wife in Sacramento, we were living there, double income, no kids  at a great life.  And I came home from working on the ranch one weekend, I said, Hey, Lisa, we got to  
**[0:18:00-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:18:00):**  go back home and try and make this a real business.  And I'm perfectly fine if we go home, try and make it a real business and fail.  But if we don't try, I don't want to wake up when I'm 61 day and be like, what if I  
**[0:18:12-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:18:12):**  would have done this, you know, I've heard enough of that in my life.  And so thankfully, she said, Yes, and we moved over here.  And well, actually, we met with my parents.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:18:24):**  My parents are on the ranch, I was living in Sacramento, we met in Napa halfway.  And we said, Hey, Mom and Dad, we want to come home.  And, and we want to take over the ranch.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:18:36):**  And they were like, Oh, this is great.  And I said, but quite frankly, we don't want to do it with you.  We want to buy all your cattle, lease all your land, and you're going to make more money  
**[0:18:47-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:18:47):**  than you are right now running it and you're and you're going to have a better lifestyle.  And less risk if you just let us take over and roll with it.  And that was a massive conversation as probably many of your listeners, we can attest to know  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:02):**  the old guard or the next generation doesn't even want to show their debt to their cards  a lot of times.  And it's a real challenge.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:09):**  But for us, it was like, hey, we're either going to do this here at home, or we're going  to move to Colorado or somewhere else.  And we're going to do it there.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:17):**  And and they saw that and they had confidence in us.  And they stepped aside and it was a miserable for about five years with family dynamics,  because we went from having, you know, 100 180 mama cows and five fields, you know, and  
**[0:19:32-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:32):**  we'd bring hate to them all winter.  And you know, all that to putting all the mama cows together and having a big bob and  having 100 pastures rotating around.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:42):**  And my dad was like, you're batshit crazy, what you're doing.  And I think I was too at the time, but I was like, well, this is what I'm doing, you know,  and, and a lot of a lot of it was just luck.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:19:54):**  And a lot of it was just, I made tons of mistakes, and I tried to make the same ones twice.  But so that was kind of how we got started out here on on that.  That was 17 years ago, I guess.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:08):**  Okay, what are your folks up to now?  My folks are still here.  They're super proud of us.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:15):**  My dad's 82.  My mom's 78.  They're our biggest cheerleaders.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:22):**  But they have nothing to do with the business.  They just cash a red check.  And my dad comes over once in a while.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:29):**  There's three ranches right next to each other.  And he comes over once in a while and goes, Hey, why don't you do this, this and this  and say, Thanks, Dad, that's a great idea.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:36):**  But I'm not going to do it because of this, this and this.  And once in a while, there's a really good idea.  But and I do rely on him some for just gut feel.  
**[0:20:47-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:20:47):**  But most of the time, that's it's his fingerprints aren't on any of our decisions.  And that's, it's I love him to death, but I don't like it.  I don't really love any of his business ideals or philosophies.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:21:02):**  It's all about work harder, work harder, work harder, make less, less money and less good  decisions, frankly.  So yeah, that's, that's a mentality that hopefully we'll be going away with, hopefully be going  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:21:16):**  away very soon is, oh, we just let's just work harder.  All you gotta do is just work harder.  And everything will be fine.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:21:24):**  Just work harder, you'll make more money and everything will be fine.  You're not busy enough to find something else to do to make more money.  Yeah, well, I grew up in that in that paradigm.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:21:34):**  And it wasn't very good because there's not none of my peers are back home on the ranch.  You know, I grew up in a pretty agricultural community.  And there's nobody doing what I'm doing maybe maybe one or two guys, you know,  
**[0:21:48-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:21:48):**  Are you the only weirdo in the community that's doing, you know, high density, high frequency  rotation grazing?  I'm one of the few, but we have, I mean, nobody's doing it as intensively as I am.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:22:06):**  But there is a lot of people that talk to our NRCS agents and talk to other, you know,  type, you know, local like leaders and say, hey, what's Lauren doing over there?  I want to do that.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:22:20):**  And they don't know how to do it quite yet.  But there's a lot of people and I'm open book I share with whatever, but they don't ask  me, you know, it's a neighborly thing, you know, Lauren, show me what you're doing here.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:22:32):**  Why are you doing that?  You know, I would love it in the next few years, if you know, even doing some field  days and stuff and sharing what we're doing, because I learn a lot.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:22:41):**  And I make, you know, I'm making tons of mistakes all the time that I would hopefully be able  to help them not make.  But there's more and more producers that are applying compost to their pastures.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:22:52):**  There's more and more producers that are splitting up their pastures and having more pastures,  not enough, but more than one, which is great.  Two to start, four is a good place to be, eight would be better.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:23:06):**  Yeah, right, right.  If you have 12, you can really make some progress.  But definitely I get it every spring people like man, you're wasting all that grass.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:23:15):**  I'm like, actually, I'm not wasting it because we need to cover and then come, you know,  November, December when it did rain, you can see like right now I have feed that's, you  know, really tall and really lush, almost too lush.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:23:33):**  And you look over the neighbor's fence, and it's like, you know, less than a golf course.  And and I'm driving out there hauling hay bale, and then you go to the coffee shop later,  and he's talking crap on the way you manage your pastures.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:23:46):**  I don't usually talk crap around me.  It's usually when I'm not.  But the analogy I use is like, hey, I don't feed cows very much.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:23:57):**  We feed a little bit hay, but I personally don't feed any of it.  I have an employee that does it.  Every time I send that employee out with a truck to feed, you know, it's it cost me probably  
**[0:24:10-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:24:10):**  $100 by the time it gets wear and tear, diesel, you know, every single string of wire of rope  is five bucks, five, 10, 15, you know, and you throw 10 of those things off.  You just, you know, you just, it was a $500 morning, and we had no gain to show we're  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:24:29):**  just keeping animals alive.  So it's really changed my paradigm.  And I know it sounds like you've had Dallas on here.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:24:35):**  I haven't listened to all your shows.  But um, you know, the ranching for profit.  I'm a big disciple of ranching for profit, and the school and you know, most of the principals,  
**[0:24:46-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:24:46):**  I mean, 99% of the principals.  And yeah, they've really they've really the school really made me just question why I  do things and if it's the right thing economically or if it's the right thing socially or if  
**[0:25:01-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:01):**  it's the right thing to make it more easy for me to do my work or if it's a lifestyle  and our business, this is my full time business.  So it's not a lifestyle.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:11):**  It's a business, I got to make money and I got to be able to leave for months at a time  and I would still run.  And  
**[0:25:17-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:17):**  I think that's important right there, what you just said, you're running it as a business  and not a lifestyle.  I think that there's a lot of people that are in, let's just say, the cattle business  
**[0:25:30-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:30):**  or want to own cows, because they want to own cows, because they want the romance or  they want to be a cowboy.  And to guys like you and me, this is I mean, it's not a job.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:45):**  It's a passion.  It's a business.  And we don't have to live at 24 seven.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:52):**  And like you said, I'd love to get to the place where I could just check out for a month  and know things are going to hum and be gone.  I'm not there yet.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:25:59):**  One of these days we'll get there.  I'm actually not there yet either.  But if you look at my life, you're like, man, how do you do that?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:11):**  Because I went on a 35 day road trip this summer with my kids and my wife.  And I was on the phone two, three hours a day, but I was not at the ranch, not once  in 35 days, you know, which is a start.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:24):**  The other thing that's really interesting on is I don't live on the ranch.  This morning, I left the house.  I left the house at five o'clock and I drove out here.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:33):**  And I made a couple stops and looked at some cattle that I bought and started this call  with you at six.  But I don't live on the ranch.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:40):**  So I can shut off, go home.  And I live in town.  And it's not my preference.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:45):**  I grew up on the ranch.  I love the ranch.  I would love to live here.  
**[0:26:48-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:26:48):**  But it makes me a better rancher, in my opinion, and a better businessman, especially because  I get to drive by 100 ranches on the way here and look at what people are doing and be like,  oh, look at that guy, man.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:00):**  He's really screwed up.  Oh, look at this guy.  I want to be more like him.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:04):**  And if there's a problem at the ranch, I'm forced to have a system in place that somebody  else can take care of it because I'm not here.  You know, I can't run home and then highway patrol calls me and says there's cows on the  
**[0:27:15-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:15):**  road.  And I get a phone call with somebody who's going to go get those cows.  And if I'm here on the ranch, and I live here, I would feel very guilty if I wasn't the one  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:24):**  out there getting the cows in with the guy that is supposed to get the cows in.  You with me?  And I would feel like a total complete jerk.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:32):**  So I could appreciate that I live.  That takes me about 15 minutes to get from my house from the time that my truck starts  moving out of the driveway.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:42):**  15 minutes later, I'm rolling into ranch headquarters.  So I can appreciate that.  And being able to say, all right, I'm leaving work, I'm checking out, and you check out  
**[0:27:56-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:27:56):**  of that mental headspace and you put that work stuff aside and you have that 15 minute  drive to get home.  It puts you back in, you know, I can get back in a home headspace where I'm not always focused  
**[0:28:06-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:06):**  on work things.  But I also see the other side of the coin.  Like there's a lot of times I say, man, it'd be pretty cool to be, you know, to live out  
**[0:28:15-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:15):**  on the ranch and instead of if we wanted to go out and tour around, instead of getting  in the truck, driving 15 minutes to the ranch, then getting in the side by side to go tour  around, it'd be nice just to walk out of the house and jump in the side by side and be  
**[0:28:26-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:26):**  able to go tour around the ranch or, you know, go look at the cows at night without an extra  30 minutes of driving.  But there's definitely both sides of that coin.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:38):**  And I can see pros and cons, pros and cons just stacked to the ceiling on both sides  of it.  Yep.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:45):**  One of the reasons that we haven't, we haven't built anything and moved out there, probably  the similar one of the similar reasons you haven't moved back to the ranch is it just  costs so friggin much to build a house.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:28:59):**  That's a really awesome, awesome segue into some of the other stuff that we're doing.  But yes, you're 100% right about that.  And it costs a lot to build a house, especially in California.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:29:13):**  But the even bigger thing about it is I can never sell a house that I'm putting on the  ranch.  Like, if I live in town, and I have a million dollar house in town, and I get sick or injured  
**[0:29:28-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:29:28):**  or want to move, I sell that thing.  I have zero emotional attachment to it, zero family legacy to it.  And I can cash in on that money and take it wherever else to do whatever else I want with  
**[0:29:41-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:29:41):**  it with no guilt.  If I come home to my family ranch, build a million dollar house, or $100,000 house or  whatever, and everything's a million bucks out here.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:29:54):**  So yeah, that's like a shanty most of these places, but I can't sell that asset ever.  Because I'm not that I'm not, I'm not that like, I'm not the guy that's going to sell  the family ranch.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:30:12):**  Right, you know, and maybe my kids will, but I'm not going to build a big asset.  That's basically a liability and has tied up all my cash.  And my parents did that when I was growing up.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:30:24):**  In the 1980s, they built a $200,000 house upon the hill beautiful house overlooks the  whole ranch.  And my parents don't have any money.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:30:32):**  But they have a big house up on the hill that you know, is basically a liability to them.  And someday when they give it to their kids or me or grandkids, somebody's gonna sell  it and reap all the benefit of that.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:30:44):**  I hope it never happened.  And well, for sure, it's not gonna happen in my lifetime.  But yeah, I don't want to tie my money up into that.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:30:54):**  So there, there lies the next part of this story that we can talk about.  And that's the ranch that you came to for the grass fed exchange a few years ago.  That was in 19.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:07):**  Yeah, I can't remember yesterday.  So it was something it was three or three or four years ago was the Santa Rosa grass  fed exchange.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:15):**  That was awesome.  By the way, I loved having everybody out there was like a dream come true.  I'd love to do another tour.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:21):**  When we were there, like right after we left, it quit raining and everything started looking  ugly.  Right?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:28):**  And that was a month, a month and a half later.  Yeah, usually June or July, we July we kind of dry up.  And it's Mediterranean.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:37):**  So half the year, it's supposed to rain.  It doesn't usually anymore.  And then half the year, it's dry, dry, dry, dry, like nothing.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:46):**  I try to find the words to, like, kind of describe a little bit what the place looked  like when I was there a couple years ago.  It's just Ireland, it was almost looked like paradise of green grass, you know, like,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:31:59):**  like, mid-Shenhai, just beautiful rolling hills, black cattle, you know, not overly  bright enough light to see it was just, you know, I just remember driving in and being  struck like, wow, grass here looks really good.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:32:16):**  You know, these hills, not bad to get up and down this just looks like a pretty good place  to ranch.  One of the few, I'll say this, in the last three, four years, I've traveled around, you  
**[0:32:27-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:32:27):**  know, quite a bit.  There's not very many ranches that I'd trade places with, but yours is one of them.  Yeah, that's cool.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:32:35):**  That's a great, I mean, that's a nice honor.  Thank you so much for that.  We are super blessed.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:32:40):**  And I, I mean, I have to give all the credit to the people that came before me.  So my great grandfather, Angelo, somehow he found out about this area from Italy, you  know, it's like, how do you know when he left there?  
**[0:32:55-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:32:55):**  He was coming here.  You know, it's like, how do you know about that, you know, 120 plus years ago, but I  love it.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:33:05):**  I love it here.  There's a tons of advantages and tons of disadvantages.  Mostly the disadvantages are too many people and just too much, a lot of the regulation.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:33:17):**  And it's just a hard state to do business in, but there's also tons of advantages.  You know, we pay the toll to be here, but it's an Epic, I could be in a t-shirt most  of the most days of the year, except for the middle of summer when it's foggy and windy,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:33:33):**  it's colder than it is in, you know, Nebraska when it's cold, you know, it's like it's freezing  and they say the coldest, the coldest winter ever was a summer in San Francisco.  And that's really, really true.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:33:45):**  It just super bitter, dense humidity.  That's freezing.  It's not freezing on the gauge, but it is cold.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:33:53):**  It'll go right through you.  Well, it's 24 degrees when I woke up this morning and snowing and it's the highest supposed  to be almost 60 tomorrow.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:34:04):**  Our wild bipolar weather here in the Plains, you know, 40, 45 degrees of temperature swing  in a day.  Yeah, it'd be nice to live somewhere where I could wear a t-shirt all year.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:34:18):**  Maybe New Zealand.  I don't know.  If, you know, if stuff goes bad, where would you go?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:34:23):**  And I'm like, I went to New Zealand a couple of years ago, two, three years ago, and I  love New Zealand.  It's so similar to here, except it's like, it's like 1960, you know, when it comes to  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:34:36):**  regulation and sophistication of everything.  It's just way more chill.  So I like that.  
**[0:34:45-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:34:45):**  So we talked about earlier that the vast majority, you know, 80, 85% of our grass fed beef is  imported and a lot of that does come from New Zealand.  And that's because they don't have, they don't grow a lot of grains there and they don't  
**[0:35:03-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:35:03):**  have any feedlots.  Is that about right?  You know, I think that I actually think that industry is influencing them more.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:35:12):**  The conventional industry is influencing them, they're starting to be more feedlot type situations  and they do grow some grain.  And they grow some corn.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:35:22):**  There's places that they grow corn.  But I think it's just the environment there to grow grass is very, very good.  And you know, they can grow more food on those islands than they can consume.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:35:37):**  So they have, and they don't have any markets besides the Pacific Rim and us.  So when it comes to, you know, they're very progressive producers, very progressive, and  they know their numbers, which is awesome.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:35:51):**  And they have a really good consistent product.  And so when it comes to how they're going to make money, I mean, they're pretty progressive  about marketing and about, you know, finding markets and they have to, it's similar to  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:07):**  me, when I came back to ranch.  It's like, I have to do something different because there is no way we can keep doing  what we're doing now and still make the living.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:15):**  So they have to figure it out.  They do.  They started with lamb and, you know, importing piles and piles of lamb and now it's hard  
**[0:36:24-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:24):**  to find US lamb in a grocery store.  So they've done a great job capturing that market.  And they're doing the same with grass fed beef.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:36):**  And yeah, I mean, it's, I can't fault them.  And the guys are the people that I've had that New Zealanders and Australians here to  the ranch, like on tours.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:47):**  And they're just good, awesome people, just like me and you.  And you know, if they were my neighbor, I would love for them to be my neighbor, honestly.  I've never met an Australian I didn't like.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:36:58):**  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  So.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:02):**  So, try to wrap my head kind of around the timeline where you're just a couple years  older than me.  It sounds like you came back to the ranch early 2000s.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:13):**  Is that right?  Let me think.  No.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah, 2005.  Yep, 2005.  Okay.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:19):**  So 2005, you started to make some big changes with fencing and the way the cattle were grazing.  When did you start adding other species?  Um, so we had, see if I can get my thing to work here.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:40):**  Are we good?  I think we're on your phone, not on your AirPods.  Yeah, we're on one AirPod, but not the other one.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:49):**  But that's right.  Oh, if I have to, I'll just go speakerphone.  But we had sheep.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:37:56):**  So my grandmother had like started out with two little sheep and it grew it up to like  150 or so.  And I hated the sheep, but I love lamb, you know, but I still don't really like the sheep.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:38:09):**  But our lamb is like the best lamb on the planet, in my opinion.  It's not just ours, this just this region has amazing lamb.  And it's actually my favorite meat is really good grass fed milk, you know, milk fed lamb.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:38:26):**  We harvest them, you know, six to eight months old, still nursing.  And they're just little piggies and they're so delicious.  And then about, well, let me just take a step, a step back in the history of this.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:38:41):**  When we first came home in 2005, my whole goal was to sell three or four loads pot loads  of calves, you know, weaned to the highest bidder anywhere around the country.  And that's what we did for the first three years, we didn't do any grass fed, grass finished  
**[0:38:57-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:38:57):**  anything.  It was whole pot load 750 pound calves to the highest bidder.  They went to Lyman, Colorado, they went to some went to Nebraska, some went to Harris  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:39:08):**  Ranch here in California.  And I was all into quality, I wanted to see what the data would show.  They give us the data back.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:39:16):**  And we were like, you know, 85% choice and 5% select and a few couple percent prime,  whatever, something like that.  Maybe it was 10% select and a couple percent prime.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:39:31):**  I don't know the all the data.  But the thing that got me really got my antenna up is about 30% of our calves were getting  sick, and they were falling out of the natural program.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:39:44):**  And I was like, Why, why is this happening?  We don't have sick calves at home.  Why is this happening?  
**[0:39:50-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:39:50):**  And right around the same time, and this will probably get some of your viewership wound  up but it is what it is, is I read the book, The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan.  And he traces this steers life, you know, from the ranch all the way through the feed  
**[0:40:05-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:05):**  lot, you know.  And I was like, Man, you know what, I don't agree with everything in this book.  But he brings up some good points about how corn drives, you know, everything and it's  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:17):**  really subsidized.  It's really heavily subsidized products that are driving all of these decisions around  the country.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:24):**  And I was like, it was like, duh, I live in the Bay Area, we need to sell, you know, we  want to make a premium, we need to sell direct to consumers, and we need to give them what  they want.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:35):**  And in agriculture is like, well, it's not efficient, or it's, you know, this is not  better than that.  And I'm like, well, give the consumer what they want, and tell them the story that they  
**[0:40:44-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:44):**  want to hear, and charge them appropriately for it.  And guess what, you can live, you can build a brand and live a good life.  So that's what we, we started doing.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:40:54):**  I did a line in the sand said, we're not going to sell the feed lots anymore.  We're going to start our own brand.  That was 13 years ago, like next week, we started Stemple Creek Ranch, we came up with  
**[0:41:06-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:41:06):**  that logo, five page website, and we started selling whole beef, half beef, and quarter  beef to anywhere in the Bay Area, you pick it up at the CDFA butcher.  And Lisa, my wife, Lisa said, you need to put lamb on the website.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:41:23):**  And I'm like, what?  I'm not putting I'm not putting lamb on the website.  I hate sheep, but I'm a rancher, you know, I'm a cattle guy.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:41:29):**  Stemple Creek Ranch, we got cows on the damn logo.  Yeah, we're not doing lamb.  So kicking and screaming, I, we put lamb on the website.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:41:41):**  And within, you know, a week or two of our website going live, we started getting orders  for beef and lamb.  But we got a lot more orders for lamb.  
**[0:41:52-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:41:52):**  And the people that tasted our lamb, loved it.  And they're like, that's the best frickin lamb we've ever eaten.  And then they tried our beef.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:42:01):**  So it was like, what's, you know, my wife was right.  And people love the lamb.  And now lamb has become its own enterprise.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:42:11):**  When you look at our revenue, it's a very small percent of our revenue versus cattle,  but it's one of our most profitable enterprises.  And if I wasn't so obsessed with cattle and all that I probably have 10 times the amount  
**[0:42:26-0:42:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:42:26):**  of sheep and no cattle or, or, you know, a few cattle.  That margin is on a sheep, isn't there?  Well, you have to sell a lot of lambs to make much money.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:42:36):**  You know, we sell 500 lambs at 300 bucks a piece.  You know, you're talking 150 grand or something like that.  You're not, you know, we're not talking lots and lots of money.  
**[0:42:48-0:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:42:48):**  But when you take those 500 sheep and you put them in with all of your cattle, we're  raising probably about 20% more pounds of something to sell off of our ranch.  But sheep are a totally different management thing.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:04):**  So keeping them alive, everything loves to eat them, including coyotes.  And then for the soil health thing, which we can talk more about, they're actually miserable  for soil health in my operation.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:19):**  Because I'm trying to get forbs established, right?  And like chicory, plantain, brassicas, you know, other types of things, because we're  trying to get roots deep into the soil.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:31):**  And unless you have a very aggressive rotational system with your sheep, they will just eat,  eat, eat, like they'll eat a chicory plant until they, until it's dead, they'll eat it  down into the ground.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:43):**  And the same with any of these tap rooted plantains.  You can look and be like, oh, there's no clover and there's no plantain and there's no chicory  in this field.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:51):**  And you move the sheep out and month and a half later, you see all kinds of chicory and  stuff.  And they just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:43:59):**  And they prefer overgrass.  And the way that we manage right now is there's a bunch of coyotes around here.  We do what we can to abate them.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:08):**  But  I was going to ask about predation.  Like  
**[0:44:14-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:14):**  Yeah, yeah, well, we have that issue.  But we have guardian dogs with the sheep.  We have two Maremma, Akbash guardian dogs.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:23):**  And they're awesome, except managing them is unlike managing a whole other class of  livestock.  One day, they're five miles away at the local post office, the next day, they're in town,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:32):**  the next day, they're sleeping on the road, you know, if you don't have a really good  fence.  So we have really good fences, and we still have that problem.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:40):**  But because of the really good fences, we just keep the sheep in those areas where the  really good fences are.  And it's not the best management practice for soil health, because we end up set stocking  
**[0:44:52-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:44:52):**  certain pastures more than our sheep pastures.  And then we'll end up, we end up compromising our  diversity in the pastures.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:45:06):**  And we get a lot of compaction with sheep, they call it a sheep foot for a reason.  They're little teeny feet, but they compact the heck out of everything.  And so, for those reasons, it's 100% management, I would like to have a lot more sheep, but  
**[0:45:20-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:45:20):**  I need to be a better manager to run them with the cows.  And the dogs don't like the cows around the sheep, and I'm in the grass finishing business.  So if I run the sheep and the cattle together, the dogs chase, the dogs chase the cattle,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:45:38):**  and that's not good for grass fattening animals.  So  run a couple of pounds a day off.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:45:44):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  So I'm like, this is not working.  
**[0:45:47-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:45:47):**  I've often contemplated getting rid of all the sheep.  And I'm not going to do it because they're really a good,  a really good business for us.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:01):**  But that's just, that's just what it is.  So when did, when did you start getting into pigs?  So we started selling direct to consumers.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:14):**  I'm going to go for a little walk here, somebody just pulled in.  We started selling direct to consumers about  13 years ago.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:24):**  And when we went to the farmers market, people were wanting,  people were really wanting to,  people really wanting to  
**[0:46:36-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:36):**  eat bacon.  And I was like, okay, we can do that.  We can get some, we can get some pigs and we put some pastured pigs up and it actually  
**[0:46:48-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:48):**  became a surprisingly good,  surprisingly good enterprise.  And now we do around 200 pigs a year.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:46:57):**  I just got another, I buy piglets and then we finish them out on the pasture.  They eat mostly grain,  but they also root around and eat other stuff too.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:06):**  And yeah.  So do the pig.  So what, what's your rotation generally like cows first, then sheep, then pigs, or, or  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:17):**  is it something different?  You're muted.  Sorry.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah.  I just muted on purpose because some guy just pulled in and we're doing a little, a little  movie thing for, for a Japanese TV station today actually.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:34):**  And they're here to do some filming.  So we'll do that after this.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:41):**  So what was your question again about the pigs?  Just when did you get into the pigs?  Oh yeah.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:48):**  Because people like to eat bacon cheeseburgers, right?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:47:54):**  And at the farmer's market, if we're selling one thing or, you know, if we're only selling  one thing, we're going to get only the people that want beef.  But if we can pile on different products, then we get beef, lamb, pork, bacon.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:04):**  We can make lots of sausages, all these kinds of things.  So, and there's always that chance that the customer that's coming just to buy bacon is  going to buy something else.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:14):**  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  So now we have beef jerky, we have the whole thing, but the pork is actually, actually  
**[0:48:23-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:23):**  probably our number one enterprise in terms of profitability, but it's not, we don't really  want to have plans to scale it into the thousands or anything like that, but it's, but it's  super easy.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:35):**  We buy these pigs for.  Well, I say that now and now I'm probably going to have a bunch of sick pigs, but we  buy these pigs for like 150 bucks at, you know, it's wieners, 60, 50, 60 pounds.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:48):**  We put them with self feeders up in our big eucalyptus Grove.  That's not used for anything else.  And it's basically wasteland.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:48:55):**  We put hot wire fence around it and we put, we fill the self feeders with a non GMO organic  feed and the pigs eat whatever they want.  And about six months later, we harvest them and sell them for, you know, five or six bucks  
**[0:49:09-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:49:09):**  a pound on the rail.  And we make like four, 500 bucks a pig.  So it's pretty crazy.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:49:17):**  The amount of margin and you can do a lot of turnover.  You go back to Dallas mounts or ranching for profits, deal the three secrets to profit  or increase gross margin and decrease overheads and sell more, you know, sell more widgets.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:49:33):**  So we can do it.  We can do that turnover over and over and over.  And yeah, it's good.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:49:41):**  So back to predation on the lands, like, you know, so you got these two big guard dogs  running around.  I can only imagine what it's like trying to deal with a predator pressure where you're  
**[0:49:56-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:49:56):**  at being pretty much surrounded by people that aren't necessarily of the same political  alignment or, or that really understand why that's a problem for you.  So you know, if you just dropped into my ranch, you would never know that we were surrounded  
**[0:50:17-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:50:17):**  by all these people because it's pretty I mean, it's pretty rural out here.  And we still live in an area that, you know here at the ranch, like you, you basically  always have a rifle in the front seat of the pickup.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:50:35):**  And it's not uncommon for people to pull over on the side of the road and shoot a coyote  still here.  And so our neighbors all absolutely despise coyotes and are always, you know, hunting  
**[0:50:50-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:50:50):**  them.  But we, what really got us going is we, we were surrounded by some other sheep ranchers  that that they would basically get the coyotes before they came to us and we were a smaller  
**[0:51:03-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:03):**  operation.  As we got bigger, somehow the coyotes figured out that they could skirt that and they could  come to us and skip everybody else.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:10):**  And they, they came here and they, we lost 43 big lambs, like 80 pound lambs in 30 nights.  And I think that was 2007.  That's rough.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:22):**  Or something like that.  It was 2009.  Something like that.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:26):**  And I was just pulling my hair out because they'd come in and they'd kill one, they'd  eat a hind leg and then they'd kill another one and they'd eat the liver and they'd, they'd  kill a third one and they'd eat the ears off of it.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:37):**  And then they wouldn't come back.  You know, I was like middle of the night, I was up trying to like, how am I going to  get these things?  
**[0:51:42-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:42):**  I got the dogs and we lost zero where the dogs were.  I've never lost a lamb where the dogs are.  Sometimes we have lambs in different pastures and I still lose them.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:51:53):**  But right now, one of my neighbors to the south, he's losing, he's probably lost 15,  20 this year.  And he's the rabid coyote hunter every day.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:02):**  That's what he does.  He gets up in the morning and he's losing lambs.  And I'm really literally right across the fence and knock on wood, we haven't lost any  
**[0:52:11-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:11):**  to coyotes this year.  So it just got light.  Now that we had this conversation, I'll go out and it might be a couple of kills, but  
**[0:52:19-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:19):**  I hope not.  Yeah, I hope not too.  But yeah, so we aggressively abate them is what I say.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:29):**  Usually it's with lead poisoning.  Now it has to be copper poisoning in California because you're not supposed to shoot lead  bullets anymore, but you can shoot copper bullets.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:41):**  They make just about the same size hole as a lead one does, I think.  It all depends.  Yep.  
**[0:52:49-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:52:49):**  So you mentioned earlier about spreading compost.  Let's talk about that.  Because I remember when I was there for that grass fed exchange tour, you were talking  
**[0:53:02-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:53:02):**  about making compost tea, I believe, or was it maybe biochar tea?  I can't remember things are a little fuzzy.  Sun's kind of.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:53:10):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It was all compost tea.  We would make compost tea or worm tea or use like, you know, fish hydrolysate, which is  
**[0:53:21-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:53:21):**  no crab, salmon, all ground up into a hydrolysate, but it's super high in nutrients, especially  calcium and nitrogen and some of the other things that we need.  But calcium is actually our biggest limiting nutrient out here.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:53:42):**  We need a lot of calcium and it's super expensive to buy it.  So I'm trying to find other byproducts like, you know, that are easily spread that we can  use to increase soil life and biology.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:53:56):**  So we've tried a lot of different things.  But compost is something that we see a pretty big increase in quality of the forage when  we apply it.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:09):**  And basically what we do is we get free wood chips from wherever we can get free wood chips.  So it's carbon, right?  Right.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:15):**  And then we mix it with we mix it with manure from our neighbor, chicken farmer, which is  super high nutrient dense, tons of  with nitrogen.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:26):**  Yeah, exactly.  Tons of phosphorus and nitrogen.  We mix that with the wood chips.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:33):**  We turn the pile at least four times and get it to at least 140 degrees to kill any other  seeds.  And then in the fall, before it rains, we spread that compost onto the pastures that  
**[0:54:46-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:46):**  need it the most.  And you know, every year we do, I don't know, 3000 yards or so of compost.  And a compost pile.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:54:59):**  It's a pretty we have five, five rows, five windrows of compost that we turn.  And the other thing that's been really cool, like I just learned this as I go and maybe  it's real common in other parts of the country.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:55:09):**  But here it wasn't is before we spread the compost.  We actually put a bunch of seed on the compost pile.  We just lace the compost pile with seed.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:55:21):**  And then as the trucks go, spread the compost, they're also they're spreading the seed at  the same time.  And it's one less pass on the ranch.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:55:30):**  It's far from perfect in terms of coverage and all that.  But it's a way that we can get seed out there very cheaply and with fertility and hopefully  increase, you know, diversity in our pastures.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:55:43):**  Both we do that a lot with grazing, but we do it a lot faster when we when we actually  introduce new seeds and fertility.  And that's, you know, we could do a whole show about that, too, because a lot of the  
**[0:55:58-0:56:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:55:58):**  holistic management people are like, oh, you don't ever have to put a seed and you don't  ever have to put fertilizer.  I'm like, yeah, you don't have to.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:56:06):**  But in my environment, you're not going to see rapid change unless you do those things  just by grazing.  You're not going to see rapid change.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:56:16):**  You will see change, but not.  And maybe a different grazer that's better than me would see better change.  But I've been very, very aggressive in our grazing, maybe too aggressive at times, especially  
**[0:56:30-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:56:30):**  early on.  And yeah, I haven't seen the results unless I added new, new fertility and or new seeds  that I really like.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:56:44):**  So we use a lot of a few different New Zealand variety seeds that are drought tolerant for  our environment.  And yeah, they they out produce the forage that's here two to one.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:56:56):**  So I'm kind of curious about your forage base.  You've talked about, you know, really put in a lot of work to try to get forbs reestablished.  Are you I don't know how to put this.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:57:13):**  What grass was there before us white people came and screwed it up?  I guess is what I'm really asking.  Like what should be there?  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:57:19):**  You know what?  I can't tell you.  I dream about that.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:57:26):**  But I can't tell you what was here.  But I, I do believe it was a lot more diverse.  There was a lot more.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:57:34):**  There was a lot more forbs than there is now.  And there was a lot more perennials than there is now.  We have about 13 types of perennial native perennials that grow here.  
**[0:57:48-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:57:48):**  And really, the native perennials compared to the introduced forages are very poor in  terms of overall biomass and palatability.  And they're usually grow in places that the plows and the discs could not go 100 plus  
**[0:58:11-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:58:11):**  years ago.  Right.  And, you know, in the mid 1800s, this area was settled by a lot of Irish and, you know,  
**[0:58:19-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:58:19):**  Irish love potatoes, and they love farming.  And they farm everything you can get a plow on.  And you can still see the lines of erosion, you know, 100 plus years later.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:58:32):**  It's pretty crazy.  You can see that 100 years later.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:58:36):**  And I believe that we've lost I believe we're we're farming on subsoil right now.  I think we've lost two to three feet of topsoil in the last 150 years.  And with that, we've lost a lot of the seed bank.  
**[0:58:51-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:58:51):**  So that's my story.  A lot of the I gotta change you to I'm gonna lose the lose.  Let's see here.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:04):**  I just changed to my speaker because I ran out of battery here.  Can you still hear me?  Yep.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:09):**  We're still here.  Yeah, a lot.  People that come here say, well, your seed bank is still active.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:18):**  And all these all these natives are still there.  But I just don't see them.  And mostly where we see them as the rocky areas that didn't never seen an implement  
**[0:59:29-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:29):**  or their areas that we've been that the introduced forages, a lot of them are frankly are not  super palatable when they're mature, but when they're young, they are like foxtail and,  you know, wild oats and, you know, some of the rip gut brome and some of these other  
**[0:59:48-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:48):**  things right now they look amazing.  But in two months when they go to seed, they're not amazing for the cattle or, you know, your  dogs or anything else.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=0:59:57):**  And we have a lot of those plants around here.  And they're very prolific, they will out compete any of the native stuff.  And where they're out competing the native stuff, you can't even see the native stuff.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:00:09):**  So I don't know if that answered your question.  It was an answer.  I don't know if it answered it, but it was an answer.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:00:17):**  I don't have I guess my experience is a little bit limited.  Because all I have is native range.  So and of the ranch, there's maybe not even 10% of it that was ever farmed at any point.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:00:36):**  And the last of it was put back to grass in the 80s, in the late 80s.  But most of it was put back, a bunch of it was put back in the 50s.  It was only broke out for, you know, 50, 60 years.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:00:48):**  And even those places that were farmed in the 50s, I can go there and like, just like  you said, it's almost like it's on subsoil.  Things are still, you know, there's still a lot of pedestaling.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:00:59):**  And I've grazed through their ultra high densities.  I've had super long rash periods.  It just takes so friggin long to get those native plants reestablished to get their roots  
**[1:01:10-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:01:10):**  down there and start building that ground cover up.  You're right, we farmed out most of the topsoil and not just there where you are in California,  but here in the plains in the desert southwest, even further east in the Corn Belt.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:01:24):**  I don't think there's very many of us that are actually still working on good topsoil.  I think most of it is gone.  I don't think that, I think that very few people have an idea of what really good topsoil  
**[1:01:36-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:01:36):**  actually looks like.  Well, and then I was always under the assumption, you know, following Gabe Brown and Alan Williams  and all these guys, which those guys are bad-ass in my opinion.  
**[1:01:49-1:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:01:49):**  They really are doing some awesome stuff and they're the future of agriculture at my level  and hopefully bigger.  But I was always in assumption we'd build the soil down.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:02):**  And really what I'm learning the more I get into this is we're building the soil up.  But if you go to a fence line in the middle of my pasture, you know, a legacy fence line,  or you could even see old legacy fence line, the fence line is higher and then it goes  
**[1:02:15-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:15):**  down to the pasture.  And is that compaction, you know, over here?  Or is that soil loss over here?  
**[1:02:24-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:24):**  Or is that different species, diversity over here?  You understand what I'm saying?  Or is it because they haven't been grazing underneath the fence and that biomass is built  
**[1:02:36-1:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:36):**  up and it's growing and what's on the sides of it out in the pasture is staying the same  height?  I don't know.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:44):**  I've seen some of the same things.  I think a lot of it is compaction here because all, like if you go along our fence line,  all the voles and the gophers and everything, they're under the fence line.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:02:59):**  Like you can stick a penetrometer three feet deep under the fence line, but out in the  middle of the pasture where the cattle are walking, it's not that way.  So yeah, there's just more life under there and not necessarily more species, but it's  
**[1:03:18-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:03:18):**  a challenge that I'd give to anybody in our industry is go look on the side of the road,  the bar ditch or whatever you call that in different parts of the country and see what's  growing there and then go out in the middle of your pasture and see what's growing there.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:03:33):**  And there should be natives all over the side of the road, theoretically.  But there's not in a lot of our areas.  There's not.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:03:42):**  There is less compaction, but there's not natives growing wildly.  But I learn a lot from the side of the road, honestly, because I'm like, well, whatever's  going there, how can I get that to grow there?  
**[1:03:52-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:03:52):**  And it's either rest, compaction, fertility, whatever.  So just trying to be observant and pay attention to what's going on.  I learn a lot.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:04):**  There is actually, there's a pretty cool, it might be on Instagram.  We try and if you want to know what's going on around here, you can jump on Instagram.  I don't really do TikTok.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:13):**  I know you do.  You do a great job with it.  But since you brought it up, what's all your socials?  
**[1:04:19-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:19):**  It's all Stemple Creek Ranch, right?  At Stemple Creek.  At least that's what I think.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:27):**  I actually, a lot of times people are like, oh, you ate a New York steak last night.  I'm like, well, no, but I did this weekend.  I'll do some social media because I can't do it all.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:43):**  I go online live and some of these other things because she texts me and says, you got to  go live this week because every time you go live, our sales go up.  Okay, so I'll go live.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:04:55):**  And she probably tells you when to do it too.  You need to go live at five o'clock because that's when all of our people are online.  We're kind of beyond that because I'm rogue about everything.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:05:05):**  So like, tells me that I need to do it.  I do it less.  You know what I mean?  
**[1:05:10-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:05:10):**  It's not really that bad.  But I just, I'm a scatterbrain and I have so many other things going on that a lot of  times I just forget for a week at a time or there's something else that's more important.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:05:22):**  But I did one, I just posted one about regenerative agriculture and it's a, I went out in the  field in January, dug up a big old chunk of beautiful black cakey soil and it was loaded  with worms.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:05:39):**  And I'm like, I got to tell people about this.  And yeah, it's on one of our, I think I have it on LinkedIn and I have it on Instagram.  It might even be on TikTok, but I didn't put it on TikTok.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:05:54):**  I don't have a team around in my social media.  So if I, uh, I post something stupid, I usually have fans tell me pretty fast.  Yep.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:02):**  Yep.  Well, I, I actually, the, the current lady that's helping me right now is a cousin, but  lady before that super sweet, biggest fan of us ever.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:16):**  And she would post stuff on there.  Like, aren't we the best look at this.  We're the best ranchers there is on the planet.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:25):**  I would call her and say, Karen, take that off right now.  This is me talking, not you talking.  Right.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:33):**  So, um, I'd say take that off right now.  And she, she would take it down, but it's like, I would never say I'm the best rancher  on the planet or RB is the best, you know?  
**[1:06:42-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:42):**  So it's just, uh, if you ever see something like that, I guarantee it's not me that says  it.  I want other people to say it about us, but not, I don't want to, um, to be the one saying  
**[1:06:53-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:06:53):**  it she's hope he's on.  Can you see up or no, do what do you see all the text messages popping up on my phone?  Or is it just, does that not show up on the zoom?  
**[1:07:05-1:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:07:05):**  That doesn't show up on a zoom.  I just see you poking your screen.  Okay, good.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:07:12):**  So we'll circle back to, uh, to compost.  So now you're, you're putting that on like with a bulk spreader, uh, you mentioned compost  tea.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:07:23):**  And I've heard that come up several times.  So what is compost tea and how do you make it?  Oh, there's a lot of different things and it's just like a recipe for cake or cookies  
**[1:07:35-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:07:35):**  or whatever.  But compost tea is basically where you take some nutrients.  It's either compost or worm castings or a combination of, and you can brew it actually  
**[1:07:46-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:07:46):**  in a brewer for anywhere from one to 24 hours.  And that adding heat and getting, it's not heat, it's air and the air feeds the microbes  and makes them proliferate.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:08:02):**  But you could make, you can make bad compost tea and have the wrong kind of bugs proliferate.  So there's, I'm far from an expert at this, but sometimes you think you're doing the right  thing, you could actually be doing the wrong thing.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:08:21):**  So what we do with it is we use worm castings and you go, we only have a small amount of  worm castings, right?  Because it takes a lot of worms to make very much worm castings.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:08:32):**  So we take like a tea bag, which is this probably double, like two gallons, like a Ziploc baggies  and we into a 275 gallon tote, like a plastic tote.  And there we have an aquarium pump with a two inch pipe on it with holes in it.  
**[1:08:50-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:08:50):**  And we turn that baby on and it blows air through this, you know, 275 gallons of water.  And then we add other things like fish hydrolysate or whatever else we're trying to do, liquid  calcium.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:09:06):**  And then we have a little spreader.  It's basically, it's only a 55 gallon applicator that we put on the back of the side-by-side  and drive around and spread it out.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:09:18):**  We can get, we get about 20, excuse me, 20 gallons per acre.  So it's not super efficient, but I do believe it works.  And in certain areas that we can't go with a truck or a tractor, we'll go with a side-by-side  
**[1:09:36-1:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:09:36):**  to increase fertility.  And I can't say that there is a big economic benefit to it.  I'm just exploring, exploring, but the way we measure that is with bricks.  
**[1:09:49-1:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:09:49):**  So I had Nicole Masters, you probably have met or heard of her before.  She's an amazing agroecologist from New Zealand and really...  The Ranching Reboot Podcast?  
**[1:10:01-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:01):**  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  She really blew my mind about, it was probably 10 years, seven or eight years ago at a ranching  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:09):**  for profit meeting.  We were there and she was a consultant.  And I'm like, I need to have you on my ranch.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:16):**  So we, she actually got me applying seawater to the pastures and increasing bricks.  And I was like, you know, there's no way.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:26):**  There's no salt.  You're going to spray salt on your grass and it makes it sweeter.  So okay.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:32):**  When we talk about bricks too much more, what is bricks?  Especially when we're only like two miles or four miles from the ocean and all of our  fence posts and everything rot out because of all the salty air.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:44):**  I'm like, well, how can you apply salt to your pasture and actually see a benefit?  But bricks are basically the levels of sugars in your grass.  So like in the wine industry, I don't know if any of you drink wine, but the vintners  
**[1:10:59-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:10:59):**  or the wine growers, winemakers, they harvest the wine when it's at the right amount of,  or the grapes wants the right amount of bricks sugar so that they can get the flavorful wine  that they want and get the alcohol content they want.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:11:15):**  And they'll, they'll let the grapes get mature.  So they're like 17 bricks or 21 bricks, depending on what type of dry wine or they're trying  to make the same with grass.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:11:25):**  Basically like our planted oats will be 10 or 12 bricks.  So higher in sugars than some of the perennial ryegrass at certain times of the year.  So it's fun for us to go through pastures and look at different species of plants and  
**[1:11:48-1:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:11:48):**  be like, oh, okay, these forbs are actually higher in bricks than this clover.  And it tells you a lot about what implement or inputs you put in and how they react to  grow for the bricks.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:03):**  I look at it as a way, is an amount of photosynthesis that's happening because the bricks at six  in the morning are going to be different than they are at four in the afternoon after a  long day of sunshine.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:14):**  Right.  Big solar.  Yeah.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:17):**  If we take one area that we apply milk to foliar, like we've went over an acre of,  and just put milk and then acre, we put seawater and we went over and we put seawater and milk,  and we went over an area and we put fish oil, and then we went over an area and just put  
**[1:12:36-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:36):**  water.  And then we went over area did nothing.  And you went back and you tested all the bricks and the area you put milk, fish, and seawater  
**[1:12:44-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:44):**  actually went up to 21 and everything else was 10.  Well, then I was like, okay, there must be some benefit here.  And hopefully those plants are also feeding the soil and feeding the microbes and soil  
**[1:12:58-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:12:58):**  and building soil up like we've been talking about.  But for sure, we know, Alan Williams has some studies that show the higher the bricks, when  you harvest it with your cattle, the more gain you're going to get.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:13:13):**  So that's where I'm, instead of making, and this is in a Cole Masters thing, instead of  making lots of forage, like McDonald's quality food, I want to make lots of forage, but have  it be Chez Panisse quality, like Michelin star restaurant food.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:13:31):**  So my cattle can eat less of it and gain more weight.  And our whole goal is for them to eat, lay down, chew their cud, get fat, eat, lay down,  chew their cud, get fat.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:13:42):**  And that's why at certain times of the year, we move them rapidly, like five times a day,  because we want them to eat, lay down, get fat, eat, lay down, get fat and repeat.  Yep.  
**[1:13:53-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:13:53):**  I dig it.  So I've measured, I've had a, I forget what it's called, hygrometer, the thing that measures  bricks.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:14:03):**  I've had one for two years now.  And I don't, I tried to do all my measuring of bricks between two and 4pm.  I try to want to hit the peak photosynthesis, which should be, which should lag behind solar  
**[1:14:18-1:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:14:18):**  noon by about an hour to an hour and a half from what I understand from my research.  So here that's between two and four o'clock depending on the time of the year.  And I guess like it's bricks, B-R-I-X, not B-R-I-C-K-S. So if you try to Google that  
**[1:14:35-1:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:14:35):**  term is B-R-I-X.  And so what you do and you know, like specific machinery varies, but basically what you have  to do is you get your forage sample and you put it in some kind of a press and it takes  
**[1:14:50-1:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:14:50):**  an awful lot of pressure, especially on my dry native forages to get, you know, just  one or two drops of juice out to where I can put on my hydrometer glass to actually test  the bricks.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:15:01):**  So I'll share some of my numbers.  My Indian grass in 2020 was running about six to six and a half.  And this year or last year, I guess in 2021, my Indian grass was almost a full point lower.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:15:21):**  I have no reason why.  I don't know, but it's one of those things.  We just have to keep gathering data to try to understand some of these things.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:15:30):**  Another very interesting observation that I made this year was, I think it was early  June, I'd moved some customer cattle into a paddock and there's about 10 head that just  booked it to the far corner of the pasture from the gate.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:15:47):**  And they went over there and they started grazing.  I said, I want to go see what they're grazing.  So we buzzed right over there in a gator, got there and they're grazing this clover  
**[1:15:58-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:15:58):**  plant that was about, oh, maybe three or four inches tall.  And you could barely see it from all the grass that was around.  So real quick, we gathered up some of that clover.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:16:10):**  I put it in my press and I smashed it and it came out to 24 bricks.  And this was at like 10 o'clock in the morning.  And I thought, okay, great.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:16:19):**  We'll come back at two.  We'll come back this afternoon and see what this is doing and see if the bricks level  has gone up during the day at all.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:16:28):**  Well I went back over there at two o'clock and I couldn't find any clover.  They'd cleaned every single stem, every leaf of it off that hilltop.  And I swear I walked out there for probably a half hour and I couldn't find any of that  
**[1:16:41-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:16:41):**  clover, even went to the bar ditch right outside the fence and look, and I couldn't find any.  So I can't tell you what it was when it was really good, but I can tell you first thing  in the morning when I moved in there, it was, I mean, super high, 24 bricks is pretty good  
**[1:16:54-1:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:16:54):**  for native clover.  Yep.  And you'd want to, I mean, that's just being observant.  
**[1:17:00-1:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:17:00):**  Once you figure that out, you want to figure out how to make more of that.  Right.  Right.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:17:08):**  And, you know, here that's just a, those kinds of clovers are a product of late spring rains  and enough rest.  And the rest I can do, I can do that no problem is getting the timely range to grow these  
**[1:17:20-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:17:20):**  different forages is something that we struggle with pretty often.  Something else, have you heard like the correlations between gains, daily gains and, and BRIC's  numbers of forage with cattle?  
**[1:17:33-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:17:33):**  Do you, have you heard those numbers?  I have heard them.  I know I'll, one of the Allen Williams presentations I was at with the, pardon me, with the soil  
**[1:17:47-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:17:47):**  health consultants.  They share some of that data, but it's, it's a steady, I mean, it'd be like what you want  your stock performance to be because it's definitely increases rapidly as BRIC's go  
**[1:18:01-1:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:01):**  up, performance goes up either milk or, or meat performance.  Right.  I think it was somewhere around, if you're about four BRIC's, you're going to gain maybe  
**[1:18:11-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:11):**  a pound a day.  If you could get up around six to eight, you're going to look at more like a pound and a half.  Get up, get up closer to 10.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:21):**  It looks more like two.  Is that similar to what you remember?  Something like that.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:28):**  Yeah.  They're, they go together and you know, there's times of the year that we're gaining three,  four pounds a day, but we're only six BRIC's or five BRIC's or four BRIC's, but we can  
**[1:18:37-1:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:37):**  keep their belly full.  And the rumen of a cow is amazing.  And they actually will keep, keep gaining even if it is lower BRIC's.  
**[1:18:47-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:18:47):**  But yeah, it's just, it's just one tool.  I try not to get so focused on BRIC's that it's like, you know, everything revolves around  BRIC's, but it is an observation tool that helps, that helps us, especially with inputs.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:19:02):**  Like it's like, if we're going to actually do worm tea and the worms pardon me, the the  BRIC's don't go up.  Well then what are we, I mean, we're just wasting time and money and fuel.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:19:15):**  But if we do it and we double the BRIC's well then yes, it's worth it, but you can also  play games with it.  You can take sugar and take sugar and make it water, you know, suspending in water and  
**[1:19:31-1:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:19:31):**  spray that on your patches and your BRIC's are going to go way up because it's, you're  just applying sugar, but it's a boom and a bust.  It's a boom and a bust in terms of microbes.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:19:43):**  And then that ends up, there's other unintended consequences, right?  So a lot of times, even when you just apply straight manure to a pasture, you see a big  increase in forage, but that's the wrong kind of forage.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:19:58):**  It's the McDonald's versus the Chez Panisse or the, you know, Michelin star versus the  just cheap food.  And I'm still learning, honestly, like every day I'm learning more and then every year  
**[1:20:12-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:20:12):**  is different and I'm like, what in the heck?  But it seems like after we've really been in a drought since about 2013 here, we came  out for a little bit, we're back in, but it seems like this year, all of the last 10 years  
**[1:20:33-1:20:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:20:33):**  of putting everything together has actually really benefited us.  And we had, you know, we had such an amazing fall in terms of forage growth.  And hopefully if we get some more rain, we're going to have an amazing spring as well.  
**[1:20:48-1:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:20:48):**  But yeah, it seems like things are starting to come together with the grazing, the different  biodiverse mixes that we put out when we put them out and then the composting and the pasture  management, it seems like we're growing a lot more forage than we have in the past.  
**[1:21:08-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:08):**  Okay.  Good deal.  Improving production, getting more pounds per acre of forage.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:15):**  That's just more pounds per acre of beef you can grow.  That's the plan.  Yeah.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:21):**  I mean, that's the whole plan.  Yep.  Hey, so we talked about testing bricks.  
**[1:21:28-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:28):**  The other testing, have you done any carbon testing?  Yeah.  We actually have, not me personally, but we're part of this what's called RIN carbon project.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:39):**  You can Google that and it'll pop up.  But there was about 10 years ago, we were approached to do compost on our pastures and  to measure the benefit of compost versus non-compost.  
**[1:21:51-1:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:21:51):**  So we got 35 acres of pasture that we put into this 10 year study.  And we had two hectares in the middle of this pasture that we didn't apply anything to.  And then we applied a half inch of compost and a quarter inch of compost to the rest  
**[1:22:06-1:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:22:06):**  of the pasture.  And then measured it with multiple different measurement tools.  And then seven years later, measured it again.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:22:14):**  And we're going to measure it again in another few years just to see what the results are.  And actually the results that we have right now are pretty stunning on this area.  And it's exciting for me too, because what we've seen is that we've seen an increase  
**[1:22:34-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:22:34):**  in carbon in the soil of epic proportions, like seven to 10,000 pounds an acre.  And we saw it in all three treatment groups.  So we did not just see it in the compost groups.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:22:54):**  We saw it even in the control group, which means our management style is really affecting  the carbon in the soil as well as the compost application.  But there's other ranches around here that we've, and I'm not saying this is good or  
**[1:23:10-1:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:23:10):**  bad, but the compost application made a significant increase in carbon versus just the grazing.  So, did you just tell me that this carbon project has proved that your grazing works?  I think so, but it's not that scientific of a study to be like, well, maybe you've fed  
**[1:23:35-1:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:23:35):**  cows over there and that's imported carbon and that's what's increasing your carbon in  your soil.  So there could be some of that too.  
**[1:23:43-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:23:43):**  But what I can tell you is the basket of practices that we're doing are increasing carbon in  the soil and significantly, like three to 5,000 pounds a year per acre.  There will be a threshold that eventually we can't sequester any more carbon or it'll  
**[1:24:01-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:24:01):**  slow down and maybe it'll be a thousand pounds a year if we already have 10% carbon in the  soil.  But I can also tell you, and I would actually love to geek out on this and share more of  
**[1:24:14-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:24:14):**  this stuff online, but we had 12 inches of rain in 36 hours in October, which is unprecedented,  never happened before.  I was jumping with glee, driving around on the side by side in the middle of the rainstorm  
**[1:24:32-1:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:24:32):**  and I was taking videos and pictures of everything because that's how I learn a lot.  It timestamps everything.  And my neighbor's pasture was sheet flow just pouring off in there.  
**[1:24:44-1:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:24:44):**  One is because there was no residual dry matter, but two is the compaction or other stuff,  I guess.  It was just pouring off and it was brown, erosion.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:24:54):**  And then my fence line right next to it, there was no standing water and it wasn't pouring  off.  And I was like, okay, intuitively you can measure in a laboratory all you want, but  
**[1:25:07-1:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:07):**  intuitively the pasture is telling us what we want to know.  Everybody's pond around me filled up dams, like little stock troughs or tanks, you guys  call them in other parts of the country.  
**[1:25:18-1:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:18):**  My pond went up about two inches, three inches.  I was like, I need this water.  I need some runoff.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:24):**  But at the same time, I was like, okay, this is cool.  It's going into the ground and it's going to get saturated.  The carbon is like a sponge.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:31):**  It's going to suck all this up and hold it longer.  And then it's going to, when it gets saturated, it'll work its way through the soil to the  pond downhill.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:40):**  And that happened.  But it really blew my mind and gave me more and more and more confidence of what we're  doing with diverse species mix, decreased compaction with grazing and forbs and increased  
**[1:25:56-1:26:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:25:56):**  worm life and keep soil cover.  All of those things really, really, really allowed us to be the sponge when it rained  to capture that water and have it not run off.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:07):**  And when it does run off, it's clear.  It's not brown.  If it's brown, it doesn't matter if it was brown when you were a little kid and it's  
**[1:26:13-1:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:13):**  still brown when we have a big rain event.  What matters is you don't want brown water to leave your property because that's erosion  somewhere.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:21):**  So we have to figure out, we have to just pay attention and figure out like what is  causing that?  Is it no soil cover?  
**[1:26:28-1:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:28):**  Is it compaction?  Is it minerals?  Is it overgrazing?  
**[1:26:31-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:31):**  Is it what is it?  I don't know the right answer all the time, but I know the right answer on my place because  I'm watching it and I'm paying attention.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:39):**  I'm trying to make a difference.  It always makes me feel good when we get a big rain that does run off.  A lot of my soils, four to six inches of water per hour.  
**[1:26:53-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:26:53):**  You could just pour a five gallon bucket on it.  Almost disappears once the surface tension breaks and it starts going to the soil.  But every once in a while, we'll get a really ridiculous rain where we'll get four inches  
**[1:27:06-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:06):**  in 15 minutes.  I'm sorry.  There's not a whole lot of soil with the healthiest forage community on it that's going to soak  
**[1:27:14-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:14):**  that much rain.  You're going to have runoff no matter what, but it always makes me feel good when I can  go to the north end of the ranch, which is all my creeks flow south to north.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:24):**  When I can go to the north end of the ranch on one of those big rains and see the creek  running three, four, five feet deep and it's clear and it's not muddy at all.  That's a good feeling.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:36):**  That's awesome.  So you guys have something that we don't have.  I follow your TikToks more than your podcast because I just haven't yet, but I love the  
**[1:27:48-1:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:48):**  beavers that you have on your neighbor's place.  We don't have beavers here, but we have all of our riparian areas are heavily forested  with willows now.  
**[1:27:59-1:28:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:27:59):**  But 20 years ago, they weren't.  We fenced them all off.  We've planted willow trees and other diverse species.  
**[1:28:05-1:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:28:05):**  And now like you can't build a dam in California without going to jail.  But you beat them.  So I'm like, man, to change our water cycle, I really want beavers.  
**[1:28:16-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:28:16):**  And I would say, you know, if we do this podcast again in 10 years, you're going to be able  to show you the beavers because I'm going to figure out a way to have beavers here.  And it's, you know, there's trials and errors and I'm sure people are going to hate it.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:28:29):**  My neighbors are probably going to shoot them and whatever else.  But eventually we're going to see the benefit of this really change the biodiversity of  our pastures, the water cycle, and hopefully grow a lot more forages that we can use the  
**[1:28:46-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:28:46):**  cattle to harvest, to turn in, or sheep or goats or pigs or whatever it is at that time,  to harvest and turn into profit for us.  The whole thing about sustainable or holistic or anything is if you're not profitable, then  
**[1:28:58-1:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:28:58):**  it doesn't matter.  Like you have to be profitable.  Right.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:01):**  Right.  I tell you what, I'll make you a deal.  You get beavers back on your creek, the next 10 years, I'll fly back out and see it.  
**[1:29:10-1:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:10):**  I want to come back out and see beavers on Snipple Creek Ranch.  What I do is bring some beavers with you and then I'll...  Maybe I could bring a couple of those cowskills you offered to pay way too much money for  
**[1:29:23-1:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:23):**  too.  Not for me, not for me for someone else.  Yeah.  
**[1:29:28-1:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:28):**  I don't care if you're reselling as long as that margin's in it for me, I'll bring all  of them you want.  You better grow bigger horns and longer, not these little, you know, 12 inch things.  
**[1:29:37-1:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:37):**  We need like 30 inches on a side.  I got a couple.  I got a couple.  
**[1:29:41-1:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:41):**  What I want to do back there and get one that's 30 inches on a side, but a mule deer.  I want to, I love hunting and I want to get back there and harvest some deer in the Midwest.  Never been back in there.  
**[1:29:54-1:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:54):**  Love to come out and let you deer hunt.  All I can offer you is whitetails.  The mulees.  
**[1:29:59-1:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:29:59):**  I remember mule deer here when I was a kid and guys hunting mule deer and they're not  around much anymore.  I'm not sure why.  
**[1:30:06-1:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:06):**  Maybe it's because, you know, we've encouraged the population of whitetails a little more  or applied.  I'm not sure.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:15):**  We just don't have very many mule deer around here anymore.  But I do remember when I was a kid.  Awesome.  
**[1:30:21-1:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:21):**  Well, do you have anything else you want to cover?  We...  No, I appreciate your time today.  
**[1:30:29-1:30:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:29):**  I do actually have a ton of stuff to cover, but I know you're a busy guy and I know you  have another thing this morning.  Yeah.  
**[1:30:36-1:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:36):**  Well, I got a few more minutes if you have something else.  Otherwise, we'll wrap it up and we can jump on again in another few months or something.  Well, talk us through some of your stacked enterprises and how they're complementing  
**[1:30:48-1:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:48):**  each other, including like some of the hospitality things you do.  We can kind of wrap up with that.  Oh, that's great.  
**[1:30:54-1:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:30:54):**  That's a great fit to finish up with.  So I told you guys that, you know, in 2005, we moved back over here.  We first we would sell conventional loads.  
**[1:31:05-1:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:05):**  I read the book, Michael Pollan's book, decided to start Stemple Creek Ranch, started that,  started educating people about what we're doing.  And then the ranch right next door to us, like a perfect puzzle piece.  
**[1:31:24-1:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:24):**  I talked to the owner.  I needed more grass.  He said, hey, he didn't have any kids involved.  
**[1:31:29-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:29):**  I said, hey, if you ever want to sell that ranch, let me know because I'd love a chance  to buy it.  And he said, I'm never going to sell it.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:35):**  A couple of years later, I wrote him a handwritten note, said, Dave, you know, if you're ever  interested in selling this thing, zero pressure, but I have some ideas that could make it work.  Send it in the mail.  
**[1:31:47-1:31:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:47):**  Nothing.  I didn't hear a word from him.  And then I ran into him at the post office about six months later.  
**[1:31:54-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:54):**  And he he said, hey, I got your note.  Thanks for that.  What would that look like?  
**[1:31:58-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:31:58):**  And I was like, oh, my God.  Like, whoa, yes.  So we figured out a deal that would work for him and for us.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:32:07):**  And it's this beautiful, beautiful romantic ranch.  Actually, that's a painting of it.  I'm sitting here at the ranch and it's just a gorgeous little honey hole down here.  
**[1:32:18-1:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:32:18):**  And so we bought the place and it was only two hundred and ten acres.  But as you can imagine, being this close to San Francisco, it's highly desirable.  Two hundred and ten acres.  
**[1:32:29-1:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:32:29):**  And we had a you know, we bought it for ranching, not for anything else, but we had to figure  out a way to.  Pay for it.  
**[1:32:36-1:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:32:36):**  So all of these little buildings here on the ranch, we basically repurpose them into revenue  generating tools, and it goes back to, you know, do you want to build a million dollar  house on your ranch and then never sell it and not get any cash flow out of it?  
**[1:32:53-1:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:32:53):**  And in my case, I want to get cash flow to help me pay for all of the improvements, but  also be a lifestyle thing.  And so I look at this ranch like Rich Dad, Poor Dad book of, you know, three green houses  
**[1:33:08-1:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:33:08):**  and a red hotel.  Basically we turned all of these all of these buildings into revenue generating buildings.  And so we have one barn that's education barn, we call it.  
**[1:33:22-1:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:33:22):**  But we have lots of weddings and lots of farm to table dinners and lots of other events  like that, educational events or, you know, Nicole Masters or whoever comes out.  We have lots of different events and it's kind of a community hub in the barn, but it  
**[1:33:41-1:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:33:41):**  generates revenue.  We have three little Airbnbs here and then we can have our chefs come out here and stay  on the ranch and see the cattle, see the sheep, see the pigs, eat our products and all the  
**[1:33:57-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:33:57):**  weddings and the different events that we have here.  They use our products and we help educate people about regenerative agriculture, why  it's important, carbon farm planning, why it's important.  
**[1:34:10-1:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:34:10):**  They get to taste our product.  They love it.  They go home and they order it and it's really an awesome enterprise.  
**[1:34:18-1:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:34:18):**  So that's our one enterprise.  That's like, okay, so we have ranching where we can sell pasture, we can sell hay, we can  sell timber from our eucalyptus grove for firewood or for anything.  
**[1:34:35-1:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:34:35):**  We have pork, which is another enterprise.  We have lamb, which is another enterprise.  We have custom grazing, which is another enterprise.  
**[1:34:43-1:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:34:43):**  We have honeybees that there's a local apiary company that basically needs a place to put  their bees for half the year.  So they bring their bees here and then we sell their honey with our Stemple Creek Ranch  
**[1:34:58-1:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:34:58):**  label.  We have Airbnbs, which are another venue source.  We have farm to table dinners, which are another revenue source.  
**[1:35:07-1:35:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:35:07):**  We have events, which are another revenue source.  We have tours, which we charge for that are another revenue source.  And then we have compost.  
**[1:35:18-1:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:35:18):**  We could sell the compost if we wanted to.  We don't usually.  We have worms.  
**[1:35:23-1:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:35:23):**  We could sell the worms if we want to.  We don't do that as well.  We have hunting.  
**[1:35:29-1:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:35:29):**  That's actually not, it's not an enterprise.  Sorry, my other phone was doing it.  It's not an enterprise that we capitalize on right now, but we could really easily.  
**[1:35:42-1:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:35:42):**  So there's about five or six main enterprises, but entertainment, Airbnb, events, beef, cattle,  sheep, hay, timber, pork, lamb.  Yeah, I said that already.  
**[1:36:01-1:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:01):**  There's a bunch of different ones.  And the biggest one is beef by far.  But they all get stacked on each other.  
**[1:36:09-1:36:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:09):**  And sometimes we do better with one or better with another one, but it's nice to not have  all of our eggs just in that one basket.  For sure.  
**[1:36:18-1:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:18):**  And that's, you know, it's important to not have your eggs in one basket.  Cattle market could drop, something could kill all your lambs, something could kill  all your pigs.  
**[1:36:26-1:36:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:26):**  Something like COVID could happen and all your Airbnb and venue business dries up.  So you have to be, it's a good lesson to be diversified to make sure you still have some  income stream, even if things do happen.  
**[1:36:40-1:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:40):**  Right.  And that COVID thing is a prime example because we lost all of our business in one day, all  of our restaurant and grocery store, pardon me, our grocery store business stayed, but  
**[1:36:52-1:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:36:52):**  our restaurant business went away overnight.  And so we had to pivot, but since we were already doing direct to consumer internet  and since we already were harvesting and processing beef for grocery stores, I mean, it was, it  
**[1:37:07-1:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:37:07):**  was easy.  It was nothing as easy, but it was a good fit for us to grow that business.  So that went up 10 times when our restaurant business went to zero.  
**[1:37:17-1:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:37:17):**  And then hopefully we are going to keep a lot of that business as we progress.  And the event business went to zero, but then last year the event business went crazy because  everybody was, everybody was locked up from COVID.  
**[1:37:31-1:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:37:31):**  So Airbnb have gone crazy too.  Yeah.  The Airbnbs are as busy as we want them to be.  
**[1:37:40-1:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:37:40):**  But you know, it's, it's our, it's our home rants and stuff.  So we want to be able to pay our mortgage with all of these other enterprises and have  the cattle raised for free.  
**[1:37:49-1:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:37:49):**  That's not really the truth because we charge ourselves grazing anyway.  So we have a land business and a cattle business that teach us that in Ramsey for profit school  and the cattle pay fair market rent for the land.  
**[1:38:04-1:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:38:04):**  But the way I look at it from a big picture is like all of this other stuff is paying  my mortgage and the cattle raised for free.  So I think that could be a good way to look at it.  
**[1:38:17-1:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:38:17):**  So if somebody wants to buy meat from Stemple Creek ranch or book a stay in an Airbnb or  check out your event venue, where do we need to go?  Stemple Creek.com www.stemplecreek.com.  
**[1:38:32-1:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:38:32):**  You can geek out on everything we're doing there.  I don't actually go there very much, but I think there's lots of information there and  I don't do anything with the venue or that's, we have a full-time employee that does that.  
**[1:38:45-1:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:38:45):**  We 10 years ago, really 13 years ago when we started, it was me and Lisa and all we  did was worked 24 hours a day, really not 24, but mostly just worked.  And about eight years ago, I quit my day job.  
**[1:38:59-1:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:38:59):**  I still was selling veterinary pharmaceuticals eight plus years ago.  I quit my day job and we've grown the business by about eight times in eight years, which  has been awesome.  
**[1:39:12-1:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:39:12):**  And now we have 15 employees.  So it's not just me and Lisa anymore.  It's me and Lisa, two ranch guys.  
**[1:39:19-1:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:39:19):**  They manage all of our properties and we have a plethora of farmers market staff and about  four or five that work on the meat side of the business.  And we're probably going to be at 20 before the end of the year, because we need more  
**[1:39:36-1:39:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:39:36):**  delivery drivers and salespeople and that type of thing.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, we're having fun.  
**[1:39:44-1:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:39:44):**  That's pretty fantastic that your little operation currently employs 15 and it's planning to  expand to employ 20.  That's pretty incredible, Lauren.  
**[1:39:55-1:40:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:39:55):**  Yeah, it's a lot of pressure though, because we can't mess up.  We mess up and there's 15 other people that rely on us too.  But we're having fun.  
**[1:40:05-1:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:05):**  And I think we have some good momentum here and whole nother show we can talk about growth  and expansion if we're going to do it or not.  Because we need more pasture to grow.  
**[1:40:18-1:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:18):**  We can only do so much here.  So we're where we have some strategic alliances with other ranchers, other local ranchers  where I've sold them my mama cows, and then I buy their bulls and then I buy their calves  
**[1:40:28-1:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:28):**  back so it's less.  I don't have to run cows on my good quality finishing ground.  We run cows in the hills and other people's ranches.  
**[1:40:42-1:40:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:42):**  Strategic partnerships.  I like it.  Yep.  
**[1:40:45-1:40:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:45):**  Before I let you go, is there anything that I forgot to ask you that you need to get off  your chest today?  I don't think so.  
**[1:40:55-1:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:40:55):**  We covered everything.  We cover a lot.  But the most important thing is, I mean, just if you don't think you can do it, there's  
**[1:41:03-1:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:03):**  probably a way you can do it.  Just figure out.  I mean, think differently and challenge your own paradigms.  
**[1:41:08-1:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:08):**  Because we in agriculture have a massive amount of opportunity coming our direction right  now.  And it doesn't matter who's the president.  
**[1:41:20-1:41:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:20):**  It doesn't matter who is, you know, what's happening in Russia.  I mean, all of those things have an influence.  But the truth is people have to eat.  
**[1:41:28-1:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:28):**  And this whole environmental stewardship on ag land.  I mean, there's just a massive amount of opportunity to be very profitable in the next 20 years.  And I'm pretty much excited about it.  
**[1:41:43-1:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:43):**  I think it's going to be a fun ride for the next 20 plus years.  I agree 100%, sir.  Thanks for having me.  
**[1:41:55-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:41:55):**  It's been great, Lauren.  I appreciate the time you've given me today.  And I guess if there's nothing else, guys, have a great week.  
**[1:42:03-1:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/53-Loren-Poncia-Give-Them-What-They-Want-e1enlap#t=1:42:03):**  See ya.  Hey, thanks, bud.  Good luck with the
